Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data yet or 'conclude' messages to evaluate. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The initial demand samples for Period 1-5 (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) yield an average of 100.6 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 27.8. Since On-hand and In-transit are zero, it is critical to quickly establish inventory. I will use the 'default' lead time (L=2) and demand statistics (mu_hat, sigma_hat) based on all available samples to set the base stock level. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std, which translates to roughly 302 + safety stock. This coverage for L+1 (3 periods) is appropriate for the starting phase.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units with a promised lead time of 2. According to the mechanics, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order has not arrived yet. Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged 100.6, while the demand in Period 1 was 99. Given the promised lead time L=2, the total exposure period is L+1=3. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial distribution. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for 3 periods (~300 units), accounting for the 147 units already in transit.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 samples averaged 100.6, while the demand in the most recent two concluding periods was 99 and 100. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (147 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (current period), but we will not observe it until the Period 3 conclude message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 295 units in transit (147 from P1, 148 from P2). Since it is too early to determine if actual lead time deviates from the promised 2, I will stick with 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (using the provided historical samples and concluding data) to capture the base demand level of approximately 100 per period. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock to cover demand over 1+L (3) periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. History shows that orders placed in Period 1 (ordered=147) and Period 2 (ordered=148) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the Period 1 order was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Since it has not arrived, the actual lead time is likely at least 3, or the shipment is delayed/lost. The demand has been very stable (99, 100, 99) in the concluding periods, while the provided historical demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) show more variance. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 295 units in-transit (covering the Period 1 and 2 orders), I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand of ~100 per period, resulting in a forecast of (1+3)*100 = 400. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a safety buffer based on historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods, but we observed the Period 1 order arriving in the 'Period 4 conclude' message, which corresponds to an actual lead time of 3 periods (4 - 1 = 3). The mean demand over the first 5 periods (samples: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103) is approximately 100.6. Since we have a confirmed lead-time drift from 2 to 3, I will set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extra period of demand in the base stock calculation (covering 1+L = 4 periods). I will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical average and variance, as demand appears relatively stable around the 100 unit mark.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived at P4 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on history, we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and 393 units in-transit. The promised lead time was 2 periods, but Period 4's arrival (ordered in Period 1) confirms an actual lead time of 3 periods. The 'Carry-over Insight' also confirms L=3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 99, 100, 99, 104, 90. The mean demand is approximately 98.4. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over (L+1) periods, which is (3+1)=4 periods. 4 * 98.4 = 393.6. Since we have 393 in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, and 5) and 0 on-hand, our pipeline is almost exactly at the expected 4-period demand. I will set L to 3 explicitly to reflect reality. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the stable but slightly fluctuating demand around 100 units.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (Period 1-6) shows values of 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131. The mean is approximately 104. Lead time observation from Period 4's conclude message shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, despite a promised L=2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 403 units are in-transit (from orders in P2, P4, P5, P6). Since P2's order was placed 5 periods ago (P2 to P7) and hasn't arrived, there is a high risk of lost shipments or severely degraded lead times. I will set L=3 explicitly based on the carry-over insight. For demand (mu_hat), the recent surge in Period 6 (131) suggests we should use a more recent window. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the average of the last 5 samples (~105) multiplied by (1+L=4), resulting in a base stock calculation around 420. Given 403 are in-transit, the OR backend will order enough to bridge the gap and account for safety stock.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, not the promised 2 (confirmed by P1 arriving in P4 and P4 arriving in P7). Demand remains relatively stable around 100 units/period (mean of 7 samples: 99.1). The pipeline currently contains 311 units (ordered in P2: 148, P5: 110, P6: 10, P7: 43). Based on the 3-period lead time, we expect the P2 order (148 units) to arrive in Period 8's arrival phase, addressing the current 0 ending inventory from P6 and P7. However, to maintain the inventory position against a 3-period lead time (covering N, N+1, N+2, N+3), I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mean ~101) to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing variance. Setting L to 3 ensures the base_stock calculation accounts for the longer lead time delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is relatively stable, with a recent mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 8 periods mean = 100.1). Analysis of lead times shows variability: orders from P1, P4, and P5 arrived after 3 periods, while the P7 order arrived in just 1 period. This suggests an average actual lead time of 2.5 periods, which is higher than the promised 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am explicitly setting the lead time to 3 to ensure the inventory covers the pipeline during these longer delays. For demand, since the pattern is stable, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the current mean and volatility. This setting (L=3, N=5) will target a base stock level that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand, roughly 400 units, accounting for the current on-hand (110) and in-transit (216) levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent but frequently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods; P7 took 1). Sustained average lead time approx 2.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $387.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods. The 'carry_over_insight' previously noted a 2.5 average, which is supported by the arrival of P8's order in P9 (LT=1). Currently, we have 57 units on hand and 272 in transit (from P2, P6, and P9). The P2 order (148 units) is now significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting a potential lost shipment, which inflates the 'In-transit' count and may cause the OR backend to under-order. To compensate for the lead time instability and the likely lost units from P2, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of recent observations). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~104 units over the last 7 periods (P4-P9 samples: 104, 90, 131, 71, 107, 111 plus P1-3 approx 100). I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the inventory target (base stock) accounts for the longer/volatile lead time and overdue risks.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Potential lost shipment detected for Period 2 order (148 units), currently 7 periods outstanding against a mean lead time of 2.5.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with an average around 105 units per period. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand profile (avg ~112 in last 5 periods). A critical issue is lead time and lost shipments: the order from Period 2 (148 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. Current lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with recent receipts (P7, P8) showing 1 period and earlier ones showing 3. I will set L to 1 (recent_N=3 average of P7, P8, P10 conclusions) to reflect the recent faster arrivals, while acknowledging on-hand is currently 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent demand regime to ensure the backend base stock covers the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 2 order (148 units) confirmed lost (8 periods overdue). Recent lead time trend shifted from 3 periods to 1 period (P7, P8 orders arrived in 1 period).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with a mean around 104 units over the last 11 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The primary issue is supply chain volatility and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (148 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent observed lead times (P7 and P8 orders) being 1 period. However, the system is currently stock-depleted (0 on-hand) and there is a high in-transit volume (406 units), many of which (like P10's 110 units) should have arrived if lead time were 1. Given the volatility, I will use a conservative lead time estimate of L=2 to ensure the target base stock covers at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). This helps bridge the gap between recent fast arrivals and earlier delays. I'll use recent_N for demand (N=11) to capture the stable mean and variance while accounting for the recent stockouts affecting 'units sold' vs actual demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received two shipments: the Period 9 order (LT=3) and the Period 10 order (LT=2). This confirms that recent lead times are volatile but averaging around 2.5 periods (Observed LTs: 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). The Period 2 order (148 units) is clinically dead/lost. Demand is stable: mean of all samples is 103.8, while the last 5 samples average 112.8. Given the lead time volatility and the recent slight uptick in demand, I will set L to a conservative 3 (to ensure enough safety stock for the longer delivery cycles) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean of ~112.8. Pipeline inventory (182) + On-hand (112) is 294, which covers roughly 2.6 periods of demand at current rates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility stabilizes around a mean of 2.25 periods (last 4 arrivals: 1, 1, 3, 2). Period 2 order (148 units) remains un-concluded and is considered lost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~110 units (last 5 periods: 131, 99, 112, 113, and earlier demand samples). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 13 conclude message shows demand was 113 while only 112 units were available, leading to a stockout. In-transit inventory is 314 units, composed of the Period 11 order (24 units), the Period 13 order (132 units), and the long-lost Period 2 order (148 units). Based on history, the Period 2 order is almost certainly lost and should be excluded from pipeline calculations. Lead times remain volatile (1, 1, 3, 2 periods for the last four arrivals), averaging 1.75 over the last 4 arrivals or ~2.2 over the last 7 arrivals. I will use L=recent_N (N=4) to account for this weighted lead time. To ensure we cover demand during this lead time + review period (L+1), I will set mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 110/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand regime stable at ~110 units/period (avg last 5 periods). Current pipeline inventory contains a confirmed lost shipment of 148 units (Period 2) which must be factored out of stock calculations.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a pipeline of 391 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, the order from Period 2 (148 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 13 periods overdue. Subtracting this from the pipeline leaves 243 valid units in transit (Orders from P13 and P14). Demand has stabilized at a regime of ~110 units per period (last 5 periods avg: 111.4). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times (W = X-Z) show high variance: 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3. The average of the most recent 5 completed arrivals (P8, P8, P9, P10, P11) is (1+1+3+2+3)/5 = 2.0 periods. To account for the lost shipment and ensure the OR backend covers enough cycles, I will set L to 2 (the current moving average). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand mean of ~110, resulting in a target base stock reflecting (1+2)*110 = 330 units. This allows the system to recognize that current valid inventory (243) is below the required level, triggering the replenishment needed to offset the lost P2 order.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~110 units per period (last 5 periods: 112, 113, 128, 104, plus history). The lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent average of approximately 2.25 periods. A critical factor is the Period 2 order (148 units), which is confirmed lost after 14 periods. The current 'In-transit' figure of 441 units includes this lost 148 units; therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 293 units (441 - 148). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has caused stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the ~2 period lead time. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to utilize the observed history of 1-3 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory is 293 units as of Period 16 (148 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost and must be manually discounted from the 441 in-transit report).

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current demand analysis shows a significant regime shift. Demand at Period 16 spiked to 280 units, following a stable range of 100-130. While this may be a one-time anomaly, recent mean demand (P12-P16) is ~147. Inventory management is complicated by the 'In-transit' report of 309 units, which includes 148 units from Period 2 confirmed lost in previous insights. The 'true' pipeline inventory is 161 (309 - 148). Regarding lead time, the recent arrivals (P11-P13 orders) show a return to the 3-period lead time. To handle the demand spike and inventory discrepancy, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to match recent behavior. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~147.4, providing a (1+L) cover of 589.6 units. This helps the OR backend compensate for the lost shipment and the recent demand jump without overreacting solely to the 280 unit outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started at Period 16 (spike from ~110 to 280). Average demand last 5 periods increased to 147. Lead time has stabilized back to 3 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with demand jumping from ~110 to ~285 units. The average demand of the last two periods is 284.5. The promised lead time is 2, but recent actual lead times have stabilized at 3 periods (P11, P13, P14 all arrived in 3 periods). The order from Period 2 (148 units) is confirmed lost and must be ignored in pipeline calculations. The reported In-transit is 479, but actual effective pipeline is 331 (479 - 148). Because on-hand is 0 and we are facing a significant demand spike, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended delivery delay and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime while maintaining a buffer for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-17 avg demand is 284.5 units (+150% from previous baseline). Effective in-transit stock must exclude the 148-unit lost shipment from Period 2.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) is 283 units, a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~110. Lead times have recently stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P12, P14, P16, P17). Inventory management is complicated by a confirmed lost shipment of 148 units (Period 2) which remains in the 'In-transit' figure provided by the backend. Current reported In-transit is 875; excluding the lost 148 units, the effective in-transit is 727 units. To maintain service levels in this high-demand regime with L=3, the target pipeline inventory (base stock) needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). With an average of 283 units/period, target is ~1132 units. Current effective pipeline (0 on-hand + 727 effective in-transit) is 727, suggesting a need for ~405 more units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 283 = 1132 and use a 3-period lead time to ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders to bridge this gap.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Periods 16-18) average demand confirmed at 283 units. Lead time is currently stable at 3 periods. The 148-unit shipment from Period 2 is definitively lost and must be subtracted from the system's in-transit total when calculating replenishment.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly upwards since Period 16. The average demand for the high-demand period (P16-P19) is approximately 278 units per period, compared to the previous baseline of ~110. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand stage. Lead time has recently stabilized at 3 periods (last several arrivals observed at L=3). A critical adjustment is required for the pipeline inventory: the system reports 1141 units in-transit, but 148 units from the Period 2 order (now 18 periods overdue) are confirmed lost. Effectively, the pipeline inventory is 993 units (1141 - 148). The OR backend logic uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend is unaware of the loss, it will believe the pipeline is 148 units fuller than it is. To compensate and trigger the correct order magnitude, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds these 148 'phantom' units to the desired base stock. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+3) * 278 = 1112. Adding the 148 units to offset the lost shipment report, I set the explicit mu_hat to 1260. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P19) avg demand is 278 units. The 148-unit shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost and mu_hat must be adjusted to compensate for this phantom inventory in the OR controller's pipeline calculation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~110 units to a new mean of 287 units (average of P16-P20: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322). I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 3 periods for five of the last six arrivals (P9, P11, P13, P14 were all 3 periods; P10 was 2), so I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend covers enough buffer for the observed delay compared to the promised 2. A 148-unit shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost; since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' (1282 units) to compute orders (Order = BaseStock - InTransit), the 148 phantom units will lead to an equivalent under-order. To compensate, I am artificially increasing mu_hat by setting it using 'explicit' value: ((1 + L) * average_demand) + lost_units = ((1 + 3) * 287) + 148 = 1296. This forces the system to order the missing 148 units while maintaining the target inventory level for the current demand regime. Once the replacement order is in transit, mu_hat will be reverted to the normal calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Compensating for 148-unit lost shipment (Period 2) by increasing mu_hat explicitly. Current high-demand regime (P16-P20) average is 287 units. Actual lead time stabilized at 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (Periods 16-21) shows an average demand of approximately 273 units/period (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203). The actual lead time over most of the history has averaged 3 periods. A critical issue exists with the Period 2 order of 148 units, which is confirmed lost (20 periods overdue). The OR backend includes this 'phantom' stock in its pipeline calculation (on-hand + in-transit), causing it to under-order. To fix this, I must artificially inflate the target base stock. The desired base stock calculation is: base_stock = (L+1) * avg_demand + safety_stock. With L=3 and avg_demand=273, the baseline mu_hat is 4 * 273 = 1092. To compensate for the 148 units of 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat (explicit) to 1092 + 148 = 1240. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to cover actual needs despite the persistent error in its in-transit data. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to reflect the higher volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Compensating for 148-unit lost shipment (Period 2) by explicitly setting mu_hat to 1240 to offset phantom in-transit inventory. High-demand regime (P16-P21) average demand is 273 units. L is stable at 3.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally starting at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 283 units per period (last 7 periods: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336). The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods. A critical factor is the 148-unit order from Period 2, which is confirmed lost but remains in the system's 'In-transit' calculation (1333 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am explicitly adjusting mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. At 283 units/period, base_stock should be ~1132 units. However, since the system subtracts the reported 1333 in-transit units (which includes 148 units of garbage data), I must inflate mu_hat to offset this. To maintain a healthy pipeline and clear the stockout (on-hand is 0), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the expected demand and the lost units. The OR backend's cap formula also needs enough 'air' to allow significant ordering. I set mu_hat at 1280 to ensure the policy clears the current backlog while ignoring the 148 units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed high-demand regime (P16-P22) avg 283 units/period. The 148-unit lost shipment from Period 2 continues to distort 'In-transit' reports and requires explicit mu_hat compensation (~ +150 units).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 283 units per period. The 148-unit shipment from Period 2 is definitively lost, but it remains in the system's 'In-transit' calculation (part of the 1159 units reported). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am applying an explicit offset to mu_hat. Specifically, for a base stock calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand, I calculate (3+1) * 283 = 1132 units. To this, I add the 148-unit phantom inventory offset, resulting in a mu_hat of 1280. Lead time (L) is stable at 3 periods (last arrival from P20 and P21 confirmed this range). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P23) confirmed at 283 units/period. The 148-unit lost shipment (Period 2) continues to reside in the system's pipeline inventory, necessitating an explicit mu_hat boost of approximately 148 units to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~110 to ~283 units per period. Average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is 287 units. The 148-unit shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost (23 periods overdue) but remains in the system's 'In-transit' calculation (1348 units reported). To compensate for this 'phantom' stock in the OR backend's capped base-stock calculation, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. Following the formula: mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=3 and a forecast of 287, the base mu_hat is 1148. Adding the 148-unit offset yields 1296. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods despite some variance. sigma_hat is set based on the high-demand regime volatility (approx 40 units per period), using recent_N (N=9) to capture this variance for the (1+L) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P24) confirmed at ~287 units/period. The 148-unit lost shipment (Period 2) remains as phantom inventory in the pipeline, requiring a continuous explicit mu_hat boost of ~148 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift beginning around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the average demand is approximately 315 units per period (last 5 periods: 203, 336, 282, 315, 375, avg = 302). Observed lead times recently show stability around 3 periods (with some 2-period outliers). Crucially, the system still reports 1344 units in-transit, which includes the 148-unit shipment from Period 2 that is definitively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, I must inflate mu_hat (which covers L+1 periods) by roughly 148 units to compensate for this 'phantom' stock. Setting L=3 (requiring coverage for 4 periods), the base demand forecast is 4 * 315 = 1260. Adding the 148-unit compensation, the targeted mu_hat is 1408. sigma_hat is set to roughly 10% of the mu_hat to ensure a high service level given the stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: High-demand regime (P16-P25) stabilized at ~315 units/period. The 148-unit lost shipment (Period 2) remains as phantom inventory in the pipeline, necessitating a persistent explicit mu_hat boost of ~148 units to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained with a recent average (P16-P26) of ~284 units per period. The 148-unit shipment from Period 2 remains lost and is still recorded in the system's 'In-transit' total (now 1526 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the target base stock, I must continue to provide an explicit mu_hat boost of approximately 148 units to offset this 'phantom' inventory and prevent chronic under-ordering. Using a Lead Time (L) of 3, the target mu_hat calculation is (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Offset. With L=3 and a forecast of 285, the base mu_hat is 1140. Adding the 148-unit offset yields 1288. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the higher volatility associated with the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P26) average demand confirmed at 284 units. The Period 2 lost shipment (148 units) still requires an explicit mu_hat boost of ~148 units to neutralize its effect on the OR pipeline calculation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at high levels since Period 16. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P17-P27) is approximately 284 units. Lead time (L) has stabilized primarily at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful deliveries and stated in history), though P23 and P25 showed some arrivals in 2 periods. I will use L=3 for safety. The critical issue remains the 148-unit shipment from Period 2, which is definitively lost but still counts toward 'In-transit' in the OR backend's logic. To neutralize this, I must boost mu_hat by ~148 units. Calculation: Base mu_hat = (1 + L) * Avg_Demand = (1 + 3) * 284 = 1136. Adding the 148-unit compensation results in a total explicit mu_hat of 1284. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation of the high-demand regime is approx 45. Using the formula sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(4) * 45 = 90.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P27) average demand remains at ~284 units. The Period 2 lost shipment (148 units) still requires an explicit mu_hat boost of ~148 units to neutralize its effect on the OR pipeline calculation as the backend does not ignore 'aged' in-transit stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 285 units per period. The Period 2 order (148 units) is confirmed lost but remains in the system's in-transit total (1344 units), effectively acting as 'phantom' inventory. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. Actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods based on recent history (P26 order arrived in P28 conclude, but that message indicates it was ordered on P26 and arrived during P28, which is a 2-period lead time; however, several recent arrivals have been 2-3 periods). I will set L=3 to be safe. Forecasted demand for (1+L) periods is 4 * 285 = 1140. To neutralize the 148-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 1140 + 148 = 1288. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to capture the higher volatility of the current demand regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently in Period 30. The demand regime has transitioned significantly from a baseline of ~110 units/period to approximately 285 units/period starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 29 is 286 units. The 'In-transit' report of 1372 units includes a 148-unit shipment from Period 2 that is definitively lost; the backend OR logic counts this phantom inventory in its pipeline calculation, so I must increase mu_hat by approximately 148 units to compensate and ensure sufficient ordering. The actual lead time has stabilized to approximately 2-3 periods (recent arrivals from P20, P21, P23, P26 had lead times of 3, 2, 2, and 2 periods). I will set L to 3 to be conservative against stockouts during this high-demand phase. For mu_hat, the calculation is (1+L) * mean_demand, where mean_demand is ~286. Base mu_hat = (1+3) * 286 = 1144. To neutralize the 148-unit lost shipment phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 1144 + 148 = 1292. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the volatility of the high-demand regime (~40), set as sqrt(1+L) * 40 = 80.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P29) confirmed at ~286 units/period. The Period 2 lost shipment (148 units) continues to reside in the system's pipeline inventory, necessitating an explicit mu_hat boost of ~148 units to neutralize under-ordering by the OR engine.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained with a 15-period average (P16-P30) of approximately 286 units per period. Lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods, with an average closer to 3 (L=3). A critical system distortion exists: 148 units from Period 2 are definitively lost but remain in the 'In-transit' total reported to the OR engine. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must explicitly boost mu_hat. The adjustment is calculated as follows: (Target Inventory for L+1 periods) + (Lost units to be ignored). With Target Demand per period \u2248 286 and L=3 (L+1=4), the base mu_hat would be 1144. Adding the 148 lost units yields an explicit mu_hat of ~1292. This ensures the backend ignores the 148 phantom units when subtracting pipeline inventory from the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P30) confirmed at ~286 units/period. The Period 2 lost shipment (148 units) remains in the system's pipeline inventory, requiring a persistent explicit mu_hat boost of ~148 units to neutralize under-ordering by the OR engine.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained with an average demand of approximately 286 units (Periods 16-31). As observed in previous cycles, a 148-unit shipment from Period 2 is definitively lost but remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (1372 units). Because the OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline)', it will perceive this phantom inventory and under-order. I am explicitly setting L=3 to match recent observed lead times. At L=3, the review+lead period covers 4 units of demand (L+1). My mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * 286 + 148 (to offset the lost shipment), which equals 1144 + 148 = 1292. Sigma_hat is calculated using the sqrt(1+L) factor on the standard deviation of the high-demand regime (approx 42), resulting in ~84. This explicit configuration forces the OR engine to ignore the phantom stock and order enough to satisfy the current high demand.

The most recent demand (Period 32) was significantly higher at 388, but the general trend suggests a mean around 285. The system's in-transit inventory of 1372 units currently includes a 148-unit shipment from Period 2 that is long-confirmed as lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' stock, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. The base requirement for a lead time of 3 (L=3, so 1+L=4 periods of demand) is 285 * 4 = 1140. Adding the 148-unit offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 1288. Lead time has been consistently around 3 periods for most recent major arrivals, so L is set to explicit 3. Sigma is kept at recent levels to account for the high demand volatility observed (reaching up to 388).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level, with the average demand from Period 16 to Period 33 being approximately 287.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 1372 units. Crucially, 148 units (from Period 2) are confirmed lost and have been 'in-transit' for 32 periods. The backend OR engine treats these 148 units as available to meet future demand, leading it to under-order. To neutralize this, I must explicitly boost the expected demand (mu_hat) by approximately 148 units. Calculation: (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Lost_Units. With L=3 and Avg_Demand=288, the base mu_hat would be 1152. Adding the 148 units of 'phantom' stock results in an explicit mu_hat of 1300. Lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods in recent high-demand cycles (e.g., P20, P26, and based on the historical pattern). Sigma_hat is set based on recent high-demand volatility to ensure sufficient service levels despite stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (P16 onwards) persists, with an average demand of approximately 291 units over the last 19 periods. Crucially, the system reports 1376 units in-transit, but 148 units from Period 2 are definitively lost, making the effective pipeline 1228. Additionally, many large orders from the Period 17-21 window (271, 396, 266, 141) appear overdue or lost as they have exceeded the typical 3-period lead time significantly (P17 order is now 17 periods overdue). To manage the OR backend's under-ordering caused by these 'phantom' in-transit units (148 confirmed + several un-arrived older orders), I am continuing the strategy of an explicit mu_hat boost. Based on L=3, the base stock targets (1+L) * demand. At ~291/period, mu_hat should be ~1164. To neutralize the 148 units of known phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 1312. I'm maintaining L=3 based on historical stability and recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive pipeline delay/loss: Orders from Period 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 933 units) have not arrived by Period 35, well beyond the 3-period lead time. This, combined with the 148 units from Period 2, creates significant phantom inventory that requires mu_hat compensation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system identifies a severe supply chain disruption. There is a massive stockout (on-hand: 0) and the 'In-transit' report of 1393 units is heavily compromised by 'phantom inventory'. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (148), Period 17 (271), Period 18 (396), and Period 19 (266) are significantly past the expected 3-period lead time and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The sum of these lost units is 1081. Current high-demand regime (P16-P35) average is approximately 290 units per period. With L=3, the OR backend's target base_stock (typically (3+1)*290 = 1160) would be completely offset by the 1393 units it believes are in-transit, resulting in near-zero orders. To force the backend to ignore this phantom stock and resume ordering for the current 290 units/period demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat. calculation: (Base Demand for L+1 periods) + (Sum of Lost Inventory) = (290 * 4) + 1081 = 1160 + 1081 = 2241. Setting mu_hat to 2240 ensures the OR engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory report.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed cumulative lost/indefinitely delayed pipeline totaling 1081 units (Periods 2, 17, 18, 19). mu_hat must be boosted by ~1081 units to neutralize OR engine under-ordering. Demand remains stable in the high-regime at ~290 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge with 'phantom inventory'. Total reported in-transit is 2082 units, but a large portion consists of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: Period 2 (148 units), Period 17 (271 units), Period 18 (396 units), and Period 19 (266 units), totaling 1081 units. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, so I must increase mu_hat by these 1081 units to neutralize the error and force an order. Current demand is stable in the high regime (approx. 290 units/period). With L=3, the standard base stock calculation (\u03bc * (1+L)) would be ~1160. Adding the 1081 unit compensation leads to an explicit mu_hat of ~2241. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma is set based on the recent high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed cumulative lost pipeline is 1081 units (P2: 148, P17: 271, P18: 396, P19: 266). Systemic under-ordering occurs unless mu_hat is explicitly boosted by this amount to offset the 'In-transit' report.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is stable, with an average demand of approximately 293 units over the last 20 periods (P16-P37). Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods for the most recent arrivals, but the long-term stable lead time remains 3 periods. A critical issue is the presence of 1081 units of 'phantom inventory' in the reported in-transit total (1599 units). This phantom stock consists of confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 2 (148), Period 17 (271), Period 18 (396), and Period 19 (266). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this non-existent pipeline inventory, I am applying an explicit 'mu_hat' boost. The target base stock for a lead time L=3 (covering 4 periods) is ~1172 units (293 * 4). However, the OR engine sees 1599 in transit and 448 on hand (Total 2047), leading it to order zero. By setting mu_hat explicitly to ~2253 (the required base stock of 1172 + the 1081 lost units), we neutralize the phantom stock and ensure the engine orders enough to maintain the target on-hand level.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (P16-P38) remains stable with an average demand of approximately 285 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom inventory' (lost or indefinitely delayed shipments) still reported in the system's pipeline. Based on historical data, shipments from P2 (148), P17 (271), P18 (396), and P19 (266) are effectively lost, totaling 1081 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (currently 1881 units) in its replenishment calculation (Order = BaseStock - OnHand - InTransit). To prevent the engine from under-ordering due to this 1081-unit error, I must explicitly boost mu_hat by this amount. Specifically, the base demand for (1+L) periods (where L=3) is 285 * 4 = 1140. Adding the 1081-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2221. This ensures the backend targets a real physical inventory level sufficient to meet the 285-unit demand despite the false 'In-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 1081 units (P2: 148, P17: 271, P18: 396, P19: 266). Continuous explicit mu_hat compensation required until these orders are removed from system pipeline reporting.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in the high range, with an average of approximately 285 units per period since Period 16. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1801 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. These include: Period 2 (148 units), Period 17 (271 units), Period 18 (396 units), and Period 19 (266 units), totaling 1081 units. The OR backend uses the formula: Order = BaseStock - (On-Hand + In-Transit). Because the backend includes these 1081 phantom units in its calculation, it will under-order by exactly that amount unless mu_hat is boosted. To ensure the correct order is placed to meet the ~285/period demand with a lead time of 3, I set mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock for a 3-period lead time should be (1+L)*demand = 1140. To achieve this while the backend subtracts 1081 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 1140 + 1081 = 2221. This forces the backend to reach the necessary real inventory level. L is set to 3 as it remains the most reliable lead time estimate despite recent shorter arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 1081 units (P2, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime remains stable at ~285 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 285 units per period since Period 16. However, the OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 1863 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (148), Period 17 (271), Period 18 (396), and Period 19 (266) are missing, totaling 1081 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this non-existent pipeline stock, I must explicitly boost the mu_hat parameter. The forecasted demand for the lead period (L+1 = 4 periods) is 285 * 4 = 1140. Adding the 1081 unit phantom offset results in a target mu_hat of 2221. Lead time has recently shown a shift to 1 period (last three arrivals), but I will maintain L=3 as a conservative buffer against further volatility, as seen in the historical cycles of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Current total phantom (lost) inventory is 1081 units (P2: 148, P17: 271, P18: 396, P19: 266). This volume must be added to mu_hat calculations to offset the OR engine's pipeline inventory credit.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in the high-demand range, averaging ~285 units per period (Periods 16-41). Lead times have recently fluctuated, generally settling between 1 and 3 periods; however, the core issue is the significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Orders from Period 2 (148), Period 17 (271), Period 18 (396), and Period 19 (266) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 1,081 units. These units appear in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total: 2,097), which causes the OR backend to under-order. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=3, the calculation is (4 * 285) + 1,081 = 2,221. This ensures the backend recognizes sufficient pipeline need despite the phantom stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is stable, with the average demand from Period 16 to Period 42 being approximately 289 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the reported In-transit total. Period 37-40 saw a cluster of successful arrivals with lead times of 1-2 periods, which cleared some of the backlog, but the 'In-transit' report of 2297 units is still heavily skewed by four historically lost/indefinitely delayed shipments: P2 (148), P17 (271), P18 (396), and P19 (266), totaling 1081 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this non-existent stock, I am explicitly setting mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Phantom Inventory. With L=3 and Forecasted Demand=290, the base requirement is 1160. Adding the 1081 units of lost stock, I set mu_hat to 2241. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to account for the high volatility and service level requirements observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed total phantom (lost) inventory in system reporting remains 1081 units (P2, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime remains stable at ~290 units/period. Recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting L=3 remains the safest conservative estimate for the base stock calculation.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, the system reports 2146 units in-transit. However, historical analysis confirms a total of 1081 units are lost or indefinitely delayed: P2 (148 units), P17 (271 units), P18 (396 units), and P19 (266 units). These orders have not arrived in over 20 periods despite a lead time of 1-3 periods. This 'phantom inventory' significantly lowers order quantities because the OR engine's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline) treats them as valid upcoming stock. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory. With L=3 and average demand in the high-demand regime (P16-P43) at approximately 290 units/period, the base requirement is (4 * 290) = 1160. To offset the 1081 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 2241 (1160 + 1081). Lead time (L) is set to 3 to remain conservative given the recent P40 arrival taking 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $936.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime for chips(Regular) continues, with an average demand of approximately 285 units per period over the last 25+ periods. As of Period 45, the system reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 2082 units. However, based on the historical logs, there are four major shipments confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed: P2 (148), P17 (271), P18 (396), and P19 (266). These sum to 1081 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly credits towards the target stock level. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the high demand (avg ~285) despite this 1081-unit credit, mu_hat must be boosted. Specifically, the required base stock for L=3 is (1+L)*demand = 1140 units. With 0 on-hand and 2082 'in-transit', the engine would order 0 units without intervention. By explicitly setting mu_hat to 2221 (calculated as 1140 + 1081), we neutralize the phantom stock, prompting the backend to maintain a physical pipeline sufficient for the actual lead time of 3 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 287 units per period. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so maintaining L=3 is a robust choice. A critical issue is the presence of 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' report. Orders from Period 2 (148), Period 17 (271), Period 18 (396), and Period 19 (266) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, totaling 1081 units. Because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from its target base stock, this 1081 units of non-existent stock causes severe under-ordering. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = (1 + 3) * 287 + 1081 = 1148 + 1081 = 2229. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the physical reality rather than the inflated pipeline report. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=20) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total phantom inventory in system pipeline remains 1081 units (P2, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime (P16-P45) is stable at ~287 units/period. Explicit mu_hat adjustment of +1081 is required every period to prevent stockouts caused by distorted in-transit data.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 287 units per period. The system current reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 2254 units. However, based on extensive historical tracking, 1081 units of this total are composed of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Periods 2, 17, 18, and 19 (148, 271, 396, and 266 units respectively). These units will likely never arrive but are still 'credited' as pipeline inventory by the OR engine. To prevent chronic under-ordering, mu_hat must be boosted by these 1081 units to neutralize the distortion. Lead time (L) has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. mu_hat is calculated as (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = (1 + 3) * 287 + 1081 = 1148 + 1081 = 2229.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains high and stable, averaging approximately 289 units over the last 30 periods (P16-P47). The system's 'In-transit' report of 2298 units is heavily distorted by long-term lost/phantom inventory totaling 1081 units (from Periods 2, 17, 18, and 19), which haven't arrived in over 25 periods. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the expected (1+L) demand (~1156 for L=3) plus the 1081 units of phantom inventory, totaling 2237. Lead time L=3 is maintained as the conservative base for calculations given recent 2-3 period arrival patterns. Sigma_hat is set based on recent high-regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Cumulative phantom inventory remains 1081 units (Periods 2, 17, 18, 19). Demand regime (P16-P47) stable at ~289 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level (~289 units/period since Period 16). However, the inventory management is severely complicated by historical lost shipments (Periods 2, 17, 18, 19) totaling 1081 units. These units still appear in the 'In-transit' report of 2303 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory from its target base stock, it would significantly under-order if not corrected. At Period 49, the on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure sufficient stock for the remaining periods (L+1 coverage), mu_hat must be set explicitly to cover both the projected demand for the review and lead time (approx 1156 units for L=3) plus the 1081 units of 'phantom' inventory that the system incorrectly credits. This results in an explicit mu_hat of ~2237. L=3 is maintained as the conservative lead time based on the most recent completed cycles (P41, P42).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Total cumulative phantom (lost) inventory in system reporting remains 1081 units (Periods 2, 17, 18, 19). Demand regime (P16-P48) remains stable at ~288 units/period. Explicit mu_hat compensation must continue to prevent stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The demand remains in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 289 units/period since Period 16. The most critical issue is the systemic distortion in 'In-transit' reporting caused by 1081 units of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 17, 18, and 19). Because the OR backend credits all in-transit stock against the base stock requirement, these 1081 'phantom' units cause the system to under-order by exactly that amount. To neutralize this, I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon PLUS the 1081 lost units. With an estimated lead time L=3 (covering a 4-period horizon: 4 * 289 = 1156 units) and the 1081-unit offset, the required mu_hat is 2237. Lead time L is set to 3 to remain conservative given recent variability. Sigma_hat is calculated for the high-demand regime (P16-P49) over the (L+1) period horizon to ensure sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand regime (P16-P49) remains stable at ~289 units/period. Cumulative phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 1081 units (P2, P17, P18, P19).
