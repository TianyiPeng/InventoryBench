According to the sequence, it should arrive during P2 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible in the P2 conclude message. However, the P2 conclude message shows arrived=0, and P1 status reports 0 sold/ended. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 2 periods (arriving in P3, visible in P4) or the shipment is delayed. 2. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 300 (147 from P1 + 153 from P2). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) average ~101 units. Recent demand in P1 (134) and P2 (79) averages 106.5. 4. OR Review: The OR recommends only 7 units because it sees 300 units in the pipeline against a base-stock level calculated for L=2. However, I have had zero sales for two periods due to 0 inventory. 5. Strategy: I need to bridge the gap until the P1 or P2 orders arrive. Since I have 0 on-hand and have missed all demand so far, and the 300 units in transit are expected to arrive in P3 and P4, ordering a small amount to refine the pipeline is sensible, but the OR's 7 units is too low if demand stays at ~100.

However, looking closely at the sequencing, an order placed in Period 1 with lead_time=2 arrives during Period 3's resolution and is visible at the start of Period 4. The 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', which indicates the Period 1 order has not arrived yet. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost.\n\n2. Inventory & Demand: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the first 3 periods was 134, 79, and 124 (average ~112). Historical samples provided (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) suggest an average demand of 100.6. We have 350 units in transit (147 from P1, 153 from P2, 50 from P3). \n\n3. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units. This is because the base-stock calculation (using L=2) sees 350 units in the pipeline, which covers the projected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1). \n\n4. Adjustment: Since the Period 1 order is already overdue (it should have been reflected in Period 3 conclude if L<2, or we should see it arrive in Period 4), and we are currently at 0 stock with zero sales made to date (sold=0 in all history), we are in a stockout situation.

Pipeline (In-transit) is 303 units, consisting of orders from P6 (150 units) and P7 (actually P8, 0 units - wait, P6 is 150 units, P7 is 120 units but P7's order arrived already in P8). Let's re-verify: In-transit is 303. P6 = 150. P7 = 120 (arrived in P8). P8 = 0. Wait, history shows P8 ordered 0. If In-transit is 303, and P6 is 150, there is a discrepancy. However, looking at the history: P1-P5 are accounted for or lost. P6 (150) and P7 (120 - arrived). Let's check 'In-transit: 303'. If 150 (P6) is in transit, where is the other 153? It appears the system still counts the 'lost' P2 order (153 units) in the pipeline inventory. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand remains stable (Mean ~100). The last 3 periods were 102, 48, 86 (Avg: 78). 4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it includes the 'lost' 153 units in its pipeline calculation.

Furthermore, shipments from Period 17 (130), Period 18 (200), and Period 19 (350) are now well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (currently at 8-10 periods since ordering). Given the history of lost shipments, it is highly probable that these 680 units are also lost. The effective pipeline (Periods 24, 25, 26) consists of 520 units (150+150+220). The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 300 units per period. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the inflated 'In-transit' total visible to the algorithm (1,623), which does not account for the high rate of lost orders. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a 300-unit demand rate, we need 900 units. With an effective pipeline of only 520 units, there is a significant deficit.

However, to maintain a 95% service level against a 300-unit demand mean and variable lead times (1-3 periods), we need to ensure the effective pipeline plus on-hand covers at least 3 periods of demand (~900 units). The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the inflated raw pipeline number and the base-stock calculation not accounting for the permanent losses. Since P33 is probably lost (4 periods elapsed), the effective incoming inventory is P35 and P36 (800 units total). Adding on-hand (143) gives 943 units.

Recent average demand (P33-P37) is approximately 269 units. 4. **Strategy**: To cover demand over the next 3 periods (Period 38, plus the 2-period lead time), we need approximately 269 * 3 = 807 units. With 936 units currently reliable (636 on-hand + 300 in-transit from P37), we are slightly over-inventoried relative to the immediate need. 5. **OR Adjustment**: The OR recommendation is 0 because its formula likely sees the massive (but lost) 'In-transit' figure or the high current on-hand inventory. While I am safe for the immediate next 2 periods, ordering 0 would leave me with ~130 units by Period 40, which is risky if demand spikes or the next order is lost.

Recent demands are 199, 286, and 231. Lead-Time & Pipeline Analysis: Total in-transit is 3,303 units, but a significant portion (2,853 units) is confirmed lost due to systemic shipment failures across Periods 2 through 33. The reliable pipeline consists of orders from Period 37 onwards. Specifically, Period 37 (300) arrived previously or is accounted for; Period 40 (400) arrived at Period 40; Period 42 (150) is currently in transit and expected between Period 43-45 given the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 3,303 units. However, subtracting the 2,853 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 450 units (P40, P42). Since P40 arrived, only the P42 order of 150 units remains. With 0 on-hand and 150 incoming, and a demand rate of ~250+/period, a significant stockout is imminent.

We need to cover demand for Periods 45, 46, and 47 (L+1 periods). Expected demand for 3 periods (~825 units) is roughly equal to our reliable pipeline (800 units).
