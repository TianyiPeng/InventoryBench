Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no history to analyze yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1 to 5 shows an average of 100.6 units per period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). Given the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 19/(19+1) = 0.95, meaning the OR backend will aim for a high service level. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the system to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (N=5) and the promised lead time. The (1+L) term in the backend will account for demand during the current period plus the promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units with a promised lead time (L) of 2. According to the sequence of events, this order is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, becoming visible in Period 4's decision phase. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, and we missed 134 units of demand in Period 1 because the initial stock was 0. Historical demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) show a mean of 100.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. Since we only have historical data and one game period of observation, and the lead time hasn't been confirmed yet, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the baseline statistics including the most recent samples. This sets the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 was 134 (though the user list says 88) and Period 2 was 79 (user list says 148). Regardless of the mismatch, the system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 307 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (147 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Therefore, we currently have 0 stock to satisfy Period 3 demand, leading to lost sales, which is unavoidable due to the starting inventory and lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 to focus on the recent demand volatility (134 and 79) and set L to default (2) as no deviations from the promised lead time have been confirmed yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (147 units), Period 2 (160 units), and Period 3 (88 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time of 2, the Period 1 order (placed at Start of P1) should arrive during Period 3's resolution phase. Since the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0, and we are now at the start of Period 4, the Period 1 order is officially late. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is lost. However, it is too early to confirm a lost shipment. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to account for this observed delay. Demand history shows (134, 79, 124), with a mean of 112.3. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while extending the lead time parameter to 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2505.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3 periods). Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1 period). This suggests variability in actual lead time compared to the promised 2 periods (average observed is 2). Demand samples for the first 5 periods are: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 (Mean \u2248 100.6, Std \u2248 27.9). The current on-hand inventory is 98, with 311 units in-transit (from orders in Period 2, 4, and 5). Since we have 5 samples, and there is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current volatility and mean. For the lead time L, I will use 'calculate' to allow the system to average the observed lead times (3 and 1) which results in 2, matching the promised lead time while acknowledging the variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1642.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is low (11 units) following demand in Period 5. Historical lead times show high variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (L=3), while Period 3's arrived in 1 (L=1), with a promised lead time of 2. An order of 160 units from Period 2 is currently missing (it would have had L=3 if it arrived in Period 5, which it did not). Demand over the first 5 periods (samples: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103) averages 100.6, but the 'conclude' messages show recorded demands of 134, 79, 124, 137, 87 (avg: 112.2). Given the missing shipment from Period 2 and the lead time variability, I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure the inventory pipeline is sufficiently buffered. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean demand (~4 * 112 = 448) and sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded stock in Period 6. Historical demand for the last 6 periods averages 110.5 units (134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: Order 1 arrived in 3 periods (P1 to P4), while Order 3 arrived in 1 period (P3 to P4). No arrivals occurred in P5 or P6, and Order 2 (placed P2) is now 2 periods past its promised delivery. This suggests lead time variability or potential loss. Given the current stockout and inconsistent lead times, I will use an explicit L of 2 (promised) but set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (avg ~106) and a slightly higher explicitly set sigma to account for the lead time uncertainty and stockout risk. The OR backend will compute base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $809.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is volatile. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1), and Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (L=3). The average observed lead time is currently 2.33. Period 2 (ordered 160) and Period 5 (ordered 133) have not arrived yet. Period 2 is now 6 periods late, indicating a lost shipment. Period 5 is at L=2 (promised), so it might arrive in Period 8 or 9. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 samples being 124, 137, 87, 102, 48 (Mean ~99.6). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect the most recent regime. Given the lead time variability (L=3 seen twice), I will explicitly set L=3 for the OR engine to ensure more safety stock is held against potential delays. The 'calculate' method would only yield 2.33, while 'explicit: 3' is safer given the missed Period 2 shipment and recent delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: Actual L has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33). Possible lost shipment: Period 2 order (160 units) has not arrived after 6 periods (expected 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1484.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability and a confirmed lost shipment. The order from Period 2 (160 units) is now 6 periods overdue relative to the promised lead time of 2, confirming it is lost. The actual lead times for successful deliveries have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods, suggesting an actual average closer to 2.5-3 than the promised 2. Demand remains relatively stable with the last 5 periods (P4-P8) averaging 92 units per period. Current on-hand is 150, but with the loss of the P2 order, the pipeline is effectively lower than the 'In-transit' figure suggests. To account for the delayed/unreliable lead time, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using a recent 5-period window for demand (N=5) to capture the current stable regime. This will raise the base stock level to protect against stockouts caused by shipments taking longer than promised.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (160 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods of non-arrival; Actual lead time mean has shifted from 2 to 2.5 periods based on P4-P8 arrivals.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 137 units. Historical lead times have shown significant volatility: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), and P8 (1). The average of these 5 observed lead times is 2.2 periods. The order from Period 2 (160 units) is confirmed lost. My goal is to ensure inventory covers (L+1) periods. Using L=2.2 (explicit) reflecting the current average, and applying a demand forecast based on the last 5 periods (avg = 73.8) to account for a lower activity regime observed since P7 (48, 86, 46). mu_hat is set to (2.2 + 1) * 73.8 = 236.16.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe relative stability in demand but significant lead time variability. Historical demand samples (P1-P10) average 90.2 units/period, but recent demand (P7-P10) has moderated to 59.75 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average observed lead time of 2.2 periods (excluding the lost P2 order). The P2 order (160 units) is definitively lost after 8 periods. Existing in-transit inventory (291 units) is high relative to recent demand, partly due to defensive ordering in P4-P6. I will use a conservative demand forecast based on the full history to protect against stockouts given the LT volatility, but will set L=3 'explicitly' to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay, helping the OR engine maintain a sufficient safety buffer until the high in-transit levels resolve.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean confirmed as 2.2 periods (range 1-3). P2 shipment (160 units) definitively lost. Demand has moderated significantly from an initial avg of 112 (P1-P6) to 60 (P7-P10).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and 400 units in-transit. A notable demand shift occurs between Period 1-6 (mean ~110) and Period 7-11 (mean ~70). The most recent demand (Period 11) was 113, which is a significant spike compared to the preceding four periods (48, 86, 46, 59). This suggests the demand regime might be reverting higher or is more volatile than previously estimated. Lead times have averaged 2.2 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1). For OR parameters, I will set L to 2.2 explicitly to reflect observed history rather than the promised 2. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 7-11) to capture the lower demand regime while considering the recent spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen in the last period's jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 11 saw a spike to 113 after four periods averaging 60. Monitoring if this is a new regime or a one-off outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $893.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the situation is critical with 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 11 order of 109 units is still in transit (Promised L=2, current delay is 2 periods). Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a mean around 2.2. The Period 12 demand was 68 units, following a spike of 113 in Period 11. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is 70, whereas the earlier periods (P1-P6) averaged 110. I am using a recent window of N=6 to calculate mu_hat to prioritize the current regime (avg 70) while accounting for recent volatility. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average of 2.2 periods. sigma_hat is set to 6 periods (recent_N) to capture the recent high volatility (spikes to 113 and 68). The 0 on-hand inventory means the OR system needs to place an order that, combined with the 353 units in transit, covers the cycle of (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability update: Periods 7-12 average 70.0 (StdDev ~26), down from Period 1-6 average of 110.5. Lead time remains erratic but averages 2.2 periods across confirmed deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 353 units in-transit. On-hand was depleted due to a recent demand spike (Period 13 demand: 118; Period 11 demand: 113) which contrasts with the moderate demand observed between Periods 7-10 (avg ~60). Current pipeline includes orders from Period 6 (84 units, overdue since P9), Period 11 (109 units, expected P13/14), and any subsequent orders. Given the history, the Period 6 order is likely lost (now 8 periods since order). Lead times are highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.2). Demand seems to have shifted back into a higher-volatility regime or a higher mean after a lull. I will set the lead time to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays and the 'lost' order risk. For demand, I'll use a recent 7-period average (P7-P13) to capture the mix of the moderate lull and the recent spikes (mean ~78.8), while setting a high sigma to account for the variance (118 vs 46). mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean = 4 * 78.8 = 315.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a period of stability (P7-P10, avg 60), demand has spiked twice (P11: 113, P13: 118) signaling a possible return to high-demand regime or significantly increased variance. Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1971.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular) following a period (P14) where 109 units arrived (ordered P11) and 104 units were sold, leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 5 units. The demand history shows a notable shift: after a low-demand period (P7-P10, avg ~60), we've seen a return to higher volatility and higher demand levels (P11-P14 avg ~100.75, with spikes of 113, 118, and 104). The lead time remains highly erratic, with observed values of 1 or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P11:3). Given the promised lead time is 2, the average is roughly 2.4, but the 'high' state is 3. I will set L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand during this high-volatility phase. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent high-demand regime (P11-P14). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to capture the recent increase in volatility. This conservative approach aims to prevent stockouts like those seen in P11-P13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand returned to high levels (avg ~101) in periods P11-P14 after a brief lull. Lead time remains erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a 3-period lead time should be used for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-demand regime, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 105.8 units, compared to the previous lull. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 15 where only 5 units were available to meet a demand of 126. The lead time continues to be erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, and P11). Given the current stockout and high demand, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon, providing a necessary buffer against both lead time variability and the risk of further stockouts. I will use the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P11-P15 average demand is 105.8, returning to levels seen in the first 6 periods after a brief lull (P7-P10 avg 60). Lead time is volatile but frequently hits 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L assumption.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 368 units, which is over 3x the recent average of ~105. This appears to be a major outlier or a significant seasonal event. Combined with an ending inventory of 0 and a lost shipment of 160 units from Period 2, the pipeline is under heavy strain. Historical lead times (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11) consistently range between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for the larger arrivals. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand/high-volatility phase, I am explicitly setting lead time to 3. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture the return to high demand (P11-P16) while acknowledging the extreme spike in P16, and use a recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to reflect the significantly increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shock: Period 16 reached 368 units, significantly exceeding the previous high-demand average of ~106. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observed a massive demand spike (297 units) following an even larger spike in Period 16 (368 units), signifying a major demand regime shift or a significant seasonal event. The current average demand over the last two periods is 332.5 units, compared to the previous high-demand average of ~106. In-transit inventory is high (711 units), but we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods. Lead times continue to be erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods (P14 order arrived P17). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand surge, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delivery delays. I am using recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture the current demand explosion (averaging ~333/period), which will result in a mu_hat of ~1332 (4 periods * 333). Sigma_hat is set to explicit (100) to account for the extreme volatility observed in these surges and ensure the OR backend maintains a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shock confirmed: Period 16 (368) and Period 17 (297) represent a new ultra-high demand regime (avg 332.5), a 200%+ increase from the previous high-demand period levels. Monitoring if this peak persists.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime shock that began at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) recorded values of 368, 297, and 251 respectively, yielding an average of approximately 305 units per period. This is a significant 200%-300% increase over the previous regime (P11-P15 avg ~106). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1,126 units in-transit. Lead times remain erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods as noted in history and carry-over insights (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, and P14 all arrived with L=3). To protect against stockouts during this surge, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed upper bound of lead time volatility. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture the specific characteristics of this current ultra-high demand regime (P16-P18). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the new mean and high variance, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current scale of demand.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime sustained for 3 periods (P16-P18), averaging ~305 units/period (2.8x increase over P11-P15 avg). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in an ultra-high demand regime. While the 4-period average (P16-P19) is approximately 273 units, the most recent values (P16: 368, P17: 297, P18: 251, P19: 177) show a downward trend but remain significantly higher than historical norms. However, we have a stockout situation with 0 on-hand and 1416 units in-transit. The lead time (L) continues to be highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts in this high-volume phase, I am setting L to 3 manually and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current regime average (approx 273 per period). This results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+3)*273 = 1092. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for high volatility (StdDev approx 81). The large in-transit balance (1416) suggests the OR backend will cap the order, but high parameters are necessary to maintain a sufficient pipeline for when these shipments finally conclude.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime (P16-P19) shows signs of cooling but remains elevated: P16-P19 average is 273.25 (vs P11-P15 avg 105.8). Demand trend: 368 -> 297 -> 251 -> 177.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a state of extremely high demand and significant stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced missed sales in 5 out of the last 6 periods. While demand showed a brief cooling trend (368 -> 297 -> 251 -> 177), Period 20 saw a sharp rebound to 356 units. The ultra-high demand regime (P16-P20) now averages 289.8 units per period, which is nearly 3x the previous high-demand average. Lead times continue to be highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods (as seen in P14 and P17). To mitigate the critical stockout situation and account for the 3-period lead time risk, I am setting L explicitly to 3. I will use the last 5 periods (the ultra-high demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory system targets the current elevated demand level despite the recent volatility. This setup aims to replenish the pipeline and prevent further lost profits.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime (P16-P20) average demand confirmed at 289.8 units, characterized by high volatility (range 177-368). Lead time remains unstable, with 3 periods being the consistent upper bound for arrivals.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an ultra-high demand regime that began around Period 16. The demand for the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) is [297, 251, 177, 356, 327], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 282 units/period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 0, while 1,419 units are in-transit. Lead times are extremely volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with many recent orders failing to arrive on time. Given this volatility and a history of lost shipments (P2), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculations account for the maximum observed delay. I will use the last 6 samples for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the full shift starting at P16, and use the same window for sigma_hat to reflect the significantly increased variance of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime sustained: Periods 16-21 average 296 units/period (vs P11-P15 avg 105.8). Demand remains volatile with a range of 177-368. Lead time is volatile but frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an ultra-high demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand for the last seven periods (P16-P22) is 294 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~105. Although there was a brief dip to 177 in Period 19, the last three periods have seen demand of 356, 327, and 274, confirming the elevated state remains in effect despite high volatility. Lead times continue to be highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., Period 16 order arrived in 1 period, while Period 14 took 3). Given that inventory is currently 0 and Pipeline is large (1421 units), we must ensure we don't over-order if these shipments arrive simultaneously, but we must also cover the risk of continued 3-period lead times and current demand levels. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this ultra-high demand regime and set L to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent maximum delays observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime sustained: P16-P22 average demand is 294 units/period, marked by significant volatility (177-368 range). Lead time volatility persist between 1-3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 assumption.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an ultra-high demand regime (P16-P23) averaging 297.5 units per period with significant volatility (high of 368, low of 177). The most recent demand at P23 was 360, confirming the regime has not yet cooled. Lead times remain highly erratic, occurring in 1, 2, or 3 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-consequence environment (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am maintaining L=3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent upper bound of the delivery window. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=8, covering the entire detected high-demand regime from P16-P23 to capture the current mean of ~298 accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to ensure the backend accounts for the substantial variance (Std Dev ~63) observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime (P16-P23) confirmed with an average of 297.5 units/period and high volatility (Std Dev ~63). Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in an ultra-high demand regime (Period 16 onwards) with an average demand of approximately 282 units/period, but extreme volatility (range 176-368). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand balance is 0 despite massive in-transit numbers, suggesting a significant lead-time bottleneck or delivery failure. Specifically, large orders from Period 17 (329), Period 18 (415), and Period 19 (290) totaling 1034 units are yet to arrive. Historically, actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1422 corresponds to everything ordered since P15 (excluding P21-P22 which arrived). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory from the base stock, its orders will be capped or zero if the pipeline is large. However, we have 0 on-hand and need to satisfy demand immediately. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent upper-bound lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24) to capture the current high-demand regime (~282 avg). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the high volatility (Std Dev ~73).

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime (P16-P24) confirmed: average demand ~282 units/period, characterized by high volatility (Std Dev ~73). Large bulk in-transit from P17-P19 hasn't arrived by P25 decision phase.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an ultra-high demand regime (Periods 16-25) with an average demand of approximately 294 units per period and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~74). The current Period 25 conclude showed demand spiked to 394, confirming the regime remains active. Despite an in-transit pipeline of 1422 units, on-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent lead time delays and gaps in arrivals. Historical analysis confirms that lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safest estimate for planning. Specifically, large orders placed in Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 1034 units) are still in transit as of the Period 25 decision phase. Because these orders haven't concluded yet, they are likely following a 3+ period lead time (P19 + 3 = P22 arrival, but they are not visible in the P25 decision phase). I will set L to 3 and use the last 10 samples (P16-P25) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current high-demand state while allowing the pipeline to eventually fill.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime (P16-P25) average increased to ~294 units (+177% vs. P11-P15 avg). Demand remains highly volatile with a localized peak of 394 in P25. Lead time variability (1-3 periods) continues to cause stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an 'ultra-high demand regime' that began around Period 16. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P16-P26) is approximately 295 units, with a high standard deviation (approx 73). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 1448 units in-transit. This pipeline is largely composed of unfulfilled orders from the huge demand spike between Periods 17 and 19 (orders of 329, 415, and 290 units). Recent arrival history shows lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, though several large orders are now significantly overdue (P17-P19), suggesting potential logistical bottlenecks or additional lost shipments. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the extreme volatility, I will stick to a conservative L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (P16-P26) while ignoring the lower demand periods prior to P16. The large in-transit volume should prevent the OR backend from over-ordering, as it subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime (P16-P26) average demand is 294.7 units (Std Dev ~73). Deliveries from P17-P19 (totaling 1034 units) are significantly overdue as of P27, creating a massive pipeline inventory and persistent stockouts.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an ultra-high demand regime (P16-P27) with an average demand of approximately 294 units and extremely high volatility (Std Dev ~73). However, we are facing a massive logistics crisis: deliveries from P17 (329 units), P18 (415 units), and P19 (290 units) are significantly overdue (8-10 periods since ordering), totaling 1448 units in-transit. These 1448 units represent nearly 5 periods of average demand at current levels. If these shipments arrive simultaneously, we face a massive holding cost risk; if they are lost, we continue to stock out. Given that lead times have historically capped at 3 periods, the prolonged absence suggests these units might be lost or stuck in a severe bottleneck. However, the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive ordering regardless. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end of observed lead times, use a recent_N of 12 (P16-P27) to capture the current ultra-high demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the system targets a base stock that covers this elevated demand while accounting for the massive in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Significant logistics failure: 1034 units ordered in P17-P19 (overdue by 7+ periods) remain in-transit as of P28, suggesting either a massive bottleneck or high probability of loss similar to the P2 shipment.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a critical logistics failure. Specifically, 1034 units ordered in Periods 17, 18, and 19 are now approximately 9-11 periods overdue (promised L=2, observed max L=3). Given the previous precedent in Period 9 where a Period 2 shipment was confirmed lost, these 1034 units must be treated as lost to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Current on-hand is 0, and demand remains in an ultra-high regime (P16-P28 average ~294). To address this, I am using an 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the high-end of observed lead times and 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the P16-P28 regime (~295 mean, ~70 std). By setting L=3 and providing explicit high demand parameters, I am signaling the OR backend to place a large recovery order to bridge the gap created by the lost shipments and the sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Massive logistics failure: 1034 units ordered (P17-P19) are 9+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. Demand regime (P16-P28) remains ultra-high and volatile, averaging ~295 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics situation is critical. 1034 units ordered in Periods 17, 18, and 19 (overdue by 10-12 periods) are now definitively categorized as lost, mirroring the total loss of the Period 2 shipment. Current In-transit inventory includes these ghost units, which falsely inflates the OR backend's perception of available stock. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into an ultra-high regime, averaging approximately 297 units per period with significant variance. Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity, and 1034 units are lost yet still count as in-transit, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for this discrepancy. Effective lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I am setting L=3 to ensure a robust safety buffer. My mu_hat calculation target: (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Lost_Inventory. With L=3, 4 periods of demand @ 297 = 1188. Adding the 1034 lost units to 'force' the OR engine to order despite the ghost units brings the explicit mu_hat to 2222. This will trigger the replenishment needed to overcome the stockout caused by the logistics failure.

Carry-over insight: Logistics failure confirmed: 1034 units (ordered P17-P19) are 10+ periods overdue and considered lost. High-demand regime (P16-P29) continues, averaging ~297 units/period. Parameters adjusted to bypass ghost pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into an ultra-high regime starting from Period 16. In the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 293 units per period (Standard Deviation ~70). The current period (31) sees 0 on-hand inventory and 2093 units in-transit. Crucially, 1034 units are from Periods 17-19 and are over 11 periods overdue; these are considered lost. The backend OR logic subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I will continue using 'explicit' settings. I estimate the base_stock requirement as (L+1)*mu + Z*sigma*sqrt(L+1). For L=3 and L+1=4: 4 * 293 + 1.28 * 70 * 2 = 1172 + 179 = 1351. Since the valid in-transit inventory (excluding lost units) is 2093 - 1034 = 1059, the order should aim to cover the shortfall. Setting mu_hat and L explicitly to force a sufficient base stock relative to the actual functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: 1034 units (ordered P17-P19) confirmed lost after 11+ periods. Functional pipeline is (Total In-transit - 1034). Demand regime (P16-P30) confirmed at avg ~293 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an ultra-high state since Period 16, with an average of approximately 289 units per period (P16-P31). While the last few periods (P30-P31) show a slight cooling to ~230 units, the overall volatility remains high. Inventory management is severely complicated by a massive logistics failure: 1034 units ordered in P17-P19 are confirmed lost (12+ periods overdue). I must treat these as 'ghost inventory' and subtract them from the current In-transit (2093 - 1034 = 1059 functional units). Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods, so I maintain L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods using a recent_N of 15 (covering the high-demand regime from P16-P30) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to satisfy demand given the current stockout situation and lead time uncertainty. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=15 to capture the significant volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline cleanup: 1034 units from P17-P19 are confirmed lost. Functional pipeline as of P32 is 1059 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in an ultra-high state (P16-P32), averaging approximately 292.5 units per period with a standard deviation of ~65. Recent periods (P30-P32) continue this trend. In terms of logistics, 1034 units from P17-P19 are confirmed lost, which effectively reduced the functional pipeline inventory. Currently, 2093 units are listed as in-transit, but after subtracting the lost 1034 units, the functional pipeline is 1059 units (comprising orders from P21 onwards, though many of these are small or potentially delayed). Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to use L=3 for safety to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). With zero on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts, the goal is to set parameters that trigger replenishment considering the massive (but mostly lost or delayed) pipeline. I select recent_N for both demand and variance (N=17, covering the high-demand regime since P16) to capture the current intensity and volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an ultra-high regime (P16-P33) with an average of approximately 285 units per period. The pipeline is currently heavily contaminated by lost shipments from P17-P19 (totaling 1034 units) which have not arrived for 14+ periods. The actual in-transit inventory that can be expected to arrive consists of orders from P30 onwards. Currently, the recorded In-transit is 2093. Subtracting the 1034 lost units leaves a functional pipeline of 1059 units. However, we have observed zero arrivals since the P26 order in Period 28, despite the promised lead time of 2 periods. To ensure we trigger orders while correctly accounting for the total pipeline (the OR engine doesn't know about 'lost' units), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful historical arrivals. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=17, covering P16-P33) to capture the current high-demand mean (~285). sigma_hat will also use N=17 to account for the high volatility (Std Dev ~66) of this regime. This conservative approach aims to maintain stock levels despite the lag and logistics issues.

Carry-over insight: Current functional pipeline is total in-transit minus the 1034 units lost from P17-P19 orders. Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P33) average confirmed at 285 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an ultra-high regime starting from Period 16, with the average demand for the last 19 periods (P16-P34) being approximately 285 units. Lead times are highly erratic, historically ranging from 1 to 3 periods, necessitating an L=3 assumption for safety. A major logistics failure occurred between P17-P19 where 1034 units are definitively lost, which effectively contaminates the 'pipeline inventory' calculation. Current In-transit is 2093; subtracting the 1034 lost units leaves a functional pipeline of 1059 units. To compensate for these losses and the persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 20+ periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=19) to capture the high-regime demand while assuming L=3. The OR backend will use the base stock formula: (1+L)*demand + z*sqrt(1+L)*std. With L=3, the target base stock will be roughly 4 periods of demand (~1140 units). Since the functional pipeline is 1059 and on-hand is 0, the OR engine should place a replenishment order to cover the deficit.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the ultra-high state (P16-P35), averaging approximately 283 units per period (282.85 to be precise). The primary challenge continues to be a fractured supply chain. A total of 1034 units (ordered P17-P19) are confirmed lost, as they are now 16+ periods overdue. The current 'In-transit' of 2093 units includes these 1034 ghost units, meaning the functional pipeline is actually 1059 units (predominantly the large order from P30). Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining a conservative L=3 assumption to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum likely delay. Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing persistent stockouts while waiting for the P30 shipment to arrive, I will use a recent_N (N=20) approach for both demand and volatility to capture the high-variance, high-volume nature of the current regime. This forces the OR backend to target a base stock sufficient for the sustained 280+ unit demand while the cap handles the immediate inventory gap.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 285-295 units since Period 16, with significant volatility (Std Dev ~73). In Period 37, we face zero on-hand inventory and a total in-transit of 2093 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 1034 units ordered in Periods 17-19 are confirmed/highly likely lost (pipeline contamination). Subtracting these lost units, the functional pipeline is 1059 units (2093 - 1034). This functional pipeline mainly consists of the order from Period 30 (671 units) and units ordered more recently. Since lead times are erratic (1-3 periods), I maintain an L=3 assumption to ensure adequate base stock. Using recent_N=21 (P16-P36) captures the current ultra-high demand regime accurately for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The OR backend will use these values to determine if the functional pipeline (~1059) is sufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon, likely triggering an order if it falls below the safety-adjusted base stock.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the 'ultra-high' category, with Period 37 recording 307 units. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 285 units per period with significant volatility. The supply chain remains severely compromised. A total of 1034 units (ordered P17-P19) are confirmed lost, and the large order of 671 units from Period 30 has now exceeded the typical lead time of 1-3 periods (it is at 7 periods since order) without arriving, suggesting another major loss or extreme bottleneck. Current in-transit is 2093. If we subtract the 1034 units (P17-P19) and the 671 units (P30), the functional pipeline is only 388 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and recent demand averaging ~285, the functional pipeline is insufficient to cover 4 periods (L+1 with L=3 safety). I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end volatility of successful arrivals and use the last 20 periods (roughly the start of the high-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR engine to account for the current high-demand, high-variance environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Order from Period 30 (671 units) is now 7 periods overdue, suggesting a likely loss similar to the P17-P19 batch. Functional pipeline severely depleted.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains ultra-high, averaging approximately 285 units per period since Period 16. However, the system is facing severe logistics failures. Specifically, 1034 units from Period 17-19 and 671 units from Period 30 are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (now 8+ periods overdue). The current total in-transit is 2093 units. Subtracting the lost units (1034 from P17-19 and 671 from P30) leaves a functional pipeline of only 388 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a functional pipeline that doesn't cover even 1.5 periods of demand at the current average, a significant order is necessary. I use L=3 to account for the frequent upper-bound lead times observed. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3)*285 to cover lead time plus the review period. I am using recent_N (N=23) for mu_hat to capture the entire ultra-high demand regime (P16-P38) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (Std Dev ~70-80) of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed/likely lost units now total 1705 (P17-19: 1034 units; P30: 671 units). Functional pipeline = Total In-transit - 1705.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an ultra-high regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 285-295 units per period. Pipeline inventory is currently severely compromised by historical logistics failures. Specifically, 1034 units from Period 17-19 and 671 units from Period 30 are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (total 1705 units), as they are well beyond the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. The total 'In-transit' visible to the OR engine is 2093, but the functional pipeline (reliable units) is only 388 units (2093 - 1705). To compensate for the backend's use of the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I aim to set a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand, approximately 293 * 4 = 1172 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (distorted) pipeline from the base_stock, I will artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered. Setting mu_hat to 3000 effectively bypasses the 2093 unit pipeline contamination and forces the OR engine to place an order to meet actual demand requirements and replenish the empty on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline loss confirmed: 1705 units (P17-19: 1034; P30: 671) are lost. Functional pipeline is Total In-transit minus 1705. Demand regime (P16-P39) remains stable at ~291 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the ultra-high category (P16-P40), averaging approximately 287 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 66. Period 40 demand was slightly lower at 199, but this does not yet signal a regime shift. I am maintaining a conservative lead time estimate of 3.0 periods due to historical volatility (range 1-3). The pipeline inventory is heavily contaminated by lost shipments: 1034 units from P17-P19 and 671 units from P30, totaling 1705 lost units. Current total in-transit is 2940. Subtracting the lost 1705 units leaves a functional pipeline of 1235 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and we are at Period 41 of 50, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 4 * 287 = 1148) and sigma_hat to account for high volatility, allowing the OR backend to place orders that replenish the functional pipeline to meet the service level target.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an ultra-high regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 285-290 units per period with significant variance. Period 41 demand was 286 units, aligning with this regime. The primary challenge remains the inventory pipeline. We have confirmed 1705 units as lost (P17-19 and P30). The current in-transit is 2940 units. Subtracting the lost units leaves a functional pipeline of 1235 units (comprising orders from P40 and any small intervening batches). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in Period 42 of 50, we must ensure the backend sees enough demand to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the lead-time volatility (regularly hitting 3 periods). I will set L=3 to be safe. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (post-Period 16) while smoothing out the extreme volatility of the last few periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=20 to reflect the actual high volatility of this regime. This strategy aims to refill the depleted stock levels while adjusting for the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline calculation confirmed: Total In-transit (2940) - Lost units (1705) = 1235 units. Demand regime (P16-P41) stable at ~290 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an ultra-high regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 285-295 units per period with significant volatility (Std Dev ~70). Critical logistics issues are present: 1,705 units (from P17-19 and P30) are confirmed/highly likely lost. The current visible In-transit (2,940) contains these 1,705 'ghost' units. Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 1,235 units (2,940 - 1,705). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must bypass the pipeline contamination. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable P16-P42 data (mu ~290, sigma ~70). To account for the 1,705 unit deficit in the OR engine's pipeline calculation (inventory - pipeline), and since I cannot directly subtract from the backend's pipeline tracking, I will use an L=3 assumption to increase the base stock. The functional pipeline (1,235) against a 290 units/period demand covers approximately 4 periods. Given the high stockout history and erratic lead times (1-3 periods), a conservative L=3 with explicit demand parameters will attempt to force an order to replenish the lost stock.

The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 290 units per period since Period 16, with significant volatility (Std Dev ~73). In Period 43, a large order of 847 units (ordered in P40) arrived, leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 632 units. The lead time continues to be erratic, frequently hitting the 3-period upper bound. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 1034 units from P17-P19 and 671 units from P30 (total 1705 units) are confirmed lost and must be factored out to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Current in-transit is 2093 units. Functional in-transit = 2093 - 1705 = 388 units. Total functional position = 632 (on-hand) + 388 (functional in-transit) = 1020 units. To maintain a safety stock covering a 3-period lead time (L=3, so 4 periods total), we need approximately 4 * 290 = 1160 units plus safety. I will set L=3 explicitly to handle the upper bound of lead time volatility and use recent_N (N=28) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the ultra-high demand regime (P16-P43).

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline verified at Period 44: Total In-transit (2093) - Lost units (1705) = 388 units. Demand regime (P16-P43) remains stable with mean ~289 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the ultra-high phase (P16-P44) with an average of approximately 285 units per period and significant volatility. Period 44 saw an ending on-hand inventory of 385 units. Total In-transit is 2093, which includes 1705 units confirmed/likely lost (P17-19: 1034 units; P30: 671 units). The functional pipeline is therefore 2093 - 1705 = 388 units. Total functional inventory position (On-hand + Functional In-transit) is 385 + 388 = 773 units. Based on an L+1 (4 periods) coverage requirement at ~285/period, we need approximately 1140 units. Since the current position (773) is below this, the OR backend should trigger an order. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent upper-bound lead times observed, and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods (the stable portion of the ultra-high regime) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current high demand and volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 95 units following steady sales. The demand regime remains in the ultra-high state (P16-P45) with an average of approximately 285 units per period and high volatility (Std Dev ~63). Lead times are erratic but consistently capped at 3 periods for successful deliveries. A critical factor is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 1705 units (from P17-P19 and P30) are confirmed/highly likely lost and must be ignored. Total in-transit is 2093, meaning the functional pipeline is 2093 - 1705 = 388 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order that accounts for the current demand and the filtered pipeline, I am setting L=3 to cover the upper bound of lead time and using the recent 30 periods (P16-P45) to define the mu_hat and sigma_hat for the current regime. This setup ensures the base stock calculation targets the correct service level for the high-demand environment while acknowledging that 1705 units in the system's 'in-transit' count will never arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1805.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently high since Period 16, with a sustained average of approximately 290 units per period. In-transit inventory remains significantly contaminated by legacy logistics failures: 1705 units (from P17-19 and P30) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the OR backend's calculation to prevent it from under-ordering. The current total in-transit is 2093 units; subtracting the 1705 lost units leaves a functional pipeline of 388 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 following Period 46, and a persistent lead time upper bound of 3 periods, I am setting mu_hat to 1200 units (4 periods of demand at ~300/period) and L to 3. This 'explicit' mu_hat accounts for the (L+1) horizon and ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover the gap between our target stock (~1200) and the actual functioning pipeline (388), effectively bypassing the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline calculation validated at P47: Total In-transit (2093) - Lost units (1705) = 388 units. Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P46) mean remains ~290 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 2093 units, but according to historical analysis, 1705 units (from P17-19 and P30) are confirmed/highly likely lost. Thus, the functional pipeline is 2093 - 1705 = 388 units. Demand has been in an ultra-high regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 290 units per period with significant volatility (Std Dev ~73). Lead times have consistently shown a range of 1-3 periods, so I am maintaining L=3 for safety. Since we have only 50 periods total, and it is already Period 48, any order placed now (with L=3) would arrive in Period 51 (48+3), which is after the game ends. Therefore, placing a new order is useless. However, the OR backend requires parameters to define the state. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=32, covering the high-demand regime since P16) and sigma_hat to reflect current conditions, while keeping L at the conservative estimate of 3 to account for the functional pipeline logic.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 49 of 50). The primary objective is to maximize reward while minimizing ending inventory in Period 50. Historical data indicates a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16-48) with an average demand of approximately 290 units and high volatility. However, orders take 1-3 periods to arrive. Any order placed in Period 49 will arrive, at the earliest, in Period 50 (if L=1) or, more likely, after the simulation ends (if L=2 or 3). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 2093, but according to carry-over insights, 1705 units (from P17-19 and P30) are confirmed lost. This leaves a functional pipeline of 388 units (2093 - 1705). These 388 units were ordered after Period 40 but haven't arrived. Given the lead time volatility (up to 3 periods), these units might arrive in Period 49 or 50. Placing a new order in Period 49 is risky; it would only be useful if L=1, but if it arrives in Period 50, it contributes to sales for only one period, and if L>1, it arrives too late. More importantly, the OR backend's base-stock logic would likely trigger a massive order to cover future periods that don't exist. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to prevent the backend from placing new orders, relying on the existing functional pipeline to satisfy the final period's demand if it arrives.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, averaging approximately 290-300 units per period with significant volatility. The last batch of demand samples (P47-P49) shows consistency around 313-316 units. The most critical factor is the massive pipeline contamination: 1,705 units (from P17-P19 and P30) are confirmed/highly likely lost. The total In-transit is 2,093, but the functional pipeline is only 388 units (2093 - 1705). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To prevent persistent stockouts in this ultra-high demand regime, I must set parameters that ignore the 1,705 'ghost' units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the stable mean of ~291 observed since Period 16 across the (L+1) horizon. Given the lead time is frequently 3 periods, mu_hat = (1+3) * 291 = 1164. Sigma_hat is set based on the observed volatility in this regime. L=3 is used to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent 3-period arrival delay.
