Pipeline (In-transit) is 348 units (Period 1: 147, Period 2: 153, Period 3: 48). No sales have occurred yet because there has been no stock. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is roughly 100 units/period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends only 7 units because it calculates base stock based on the promised lead time (L=2) and assumes the 348 units in-transit will arrive imminently. 5. Strategy: Because the Period 1 order is already overdue (L=2 promised, but not arrived by end of P3), I suspect a lead-time extension or loss. However, placing a massive order now when 348 units are already in the pipeline (covering ~3.5 periods of demand) is risky if they all arrive at once.

The Period 2 order (153 units) and Period 6 order (150 units) are currently considered lost or significantly delayed, as later orders (P7) have already arrived. 2. Inventory Position: Currently have 116 units on-hand. In-transit inventory specifically consists of the Period 6 order (150 units, now 3 periods old and likely lost) and the Period 8 order (0 units). Wait, the 'In-transit' shows 303 units. Total orders: P1(147, arrived), P2(153, lost?), P3(48, arrived), P4(50, arrived), P5(150, arrived), P6(150, in-transit), P7(50, arrived), P8(0). Total undelivered = 153 (P2) + 150 (P6) = 303. This matches the 'In-transit' figure. Since P2 is explicitly confirmed lost and P6 is 3 periods late while P7 arrived in 1, I must treat the pipeline as effectively 0. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical mean demand across 8 periods is ~100 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 300 units), existing on-hand (116) is insufficient given the unreliable pipeline. 4.

Inventory Management: Current on-hand is 11. Assuming Period 9 (150 units) arrives in Period 11 or 12, and considering the target stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~180 units), the true current availability (On-hand 11 + valid In-transit 250 = 261) exceeds the requirement. \n4. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically correct because it doesn't account for the 'lost' units inflating the in-transit count, but even after subtracting the 303 lost units, the pipeline (250) is sufficient.

Demand Analysis: A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 16. Previous demand averaged ~101, but the last two periods averaged 332.5 (+230%). The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the unadjusted pipeline (603 units) and historical averages that don't weigh recent spikes sufficiently. 3. Inventory Strategy: With 0 on-hand and a likely demand of ~300 per period, we must prepare for the new regime. The 150 units from P15 are expected to arrive in Period 18 (P15+3), and P17 (150 units) is expected in Period 20. Total inventory until Period 20 (including today's order) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (P18, P19, P20). At 300/period, we need 900 units. Reliable pipeline + On-hand = 300. Gap = 600 units.

Subtracting the 303 lost units results in a 'true' pipeline of 600 units. These consist of orders from P15 (150), P17 (150), and P18 (300). Based on a 3-period lead time, the P15 order is expected to arrive in Period 18's resolution (visible next period) and the P17 order in Period 20. 3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift occurred at Period 16. Recent demand (P16-P18) averages 305 units/period, compared to the historical ~100. This spike is sustained over 3 periods. 4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it assumes a lead time of 2, uses an unweighted average of all history (diluting the recent surge), and likely overestimates pipeline inventory by including lost shipments. 5. **Strategy**: At a demand of ~300 units/period and a 3-period lead time, a base stock for 1+3 periods (1200 units) is needed. My 'true' inventory (0 on-hand + 600 true pipeline) is 600. I need to order to bridge this gap.

Realistic pipeline = 1203 - 303 = 900 units. 3. **Lead Time Inference**: Actual lead time fluctuates but often hits 3 periods. With current On-hand at 0, we are reliant on the arrival of orders from P17 (150), P18 (300), and P19 (300). Based on a 3-period lead time, the P17 order should arrive during Period 20, and P18 during Period 21. 4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees a massive 'In-transit' figure and ignores the stockouts.

Significant shipment losses have occurred (totaling 1,903 units from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25). The reported 'In-transit' of 2,703 units is heavily inflated. The 'Effective Pipeline' consists of orders from P29 (350), P30 (300), and P31 (150). The P29 order should arrive in Period 32 (based on the pattern of 2nd/3rd-period arrivals), but since Period 31 concluded with 0 arrived and Period 32 starts with 0 on-hand, we are currently stocked out. 2. **Demand Analysis**: Since Period 16, a regime shift to ~300 units/period (mean ~296) has been established. Recent demand (P30: 229, P31: 235) is slightly lower than the mean but still significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline. 3. **Inventory Management**: On-hand is 0. Expected arrivals in P32 is the P29 order (350 units). To cover P32 and P33 (lead time + review period), we need ~600 units (300*2). Current reliable pipeline (P29, P30, P31) is 800 units. 4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because it likely factors in the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 2,703 units and uses historical data that includes the low-demand regime (P1-P15). 5. **Final Decision**: We need to maintain the flow of ~300 units. Although the pipeline of 800 units seems sufficient for 2.6 periods of demand, the high loss rate (~50%) necessitates a proactive ordering strategy.

Current effective inventory is 93 (on-hand) + 1,050 (effective pipeline) = 1,143 units. The P33 order (350 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, which is a significant risk.

Second, the OR agent calculates the base stock using the original low-demand period (mean ~100), whereas the demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at ~290 units per period. Third, current on-hand inventory is 310, and recent arrivals (P42, P43) suggest a lead time of 2-3 periods. Effective pipeline inventory (1050 units) plus on-hand (310) equals 1360 units. With current mean demand at ~290, we require ~1160 units to cover the next 4 periods (Lead time 3 + 1) to avoid stockouts. While we technically have 1360 effective units against a 1160 demand requirement, the high historical order loss rate (approaching 50%) and the fact that we are entering the final 5 periods of the game necessitate a buffer. To maintain the flow and protect against another shipment loss, I will order 300 units to ensure coverage through the end of the simulation, accounting for the unreliability of the 'In-transit' shipments.",
