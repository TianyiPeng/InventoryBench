Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) averages 100.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock levels immediately to meet future demand. I will use the 'default' methods which calculate stats based on all available historical samples (N=5). This sets mu_hat at approximately (1+2)*100.6 = 301.8 and sigma_hat based on the sample standard deviation (~27.8) scaled by sqrt(1+2), ensuring the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 147 units placed in Period 1 is 'In-transit' and is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4), according to the L=2 definition. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has started (Period 1 demand was 134), we have experienced lost sales. Historical demand data shows a mean of 100.6 (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). Period 1's actual demand was 134. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (using the provided historical samples and Period 1) to capture the base demand level while accounting for the recent observation. Since no arrivals have concluded yet, L is set to 'default' (2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (147 units) and Period 2 (160 units). Since lead time is 2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 88, 148, 80 (sample data) and 134, 79 (actual observation), averaging approximately 106 units per period. There is no clear trend or seasonality detectable yet. I will use the 'default' method for lead time (promised L=2) and demand parameters based on all available samples to stabilize the inventory level, as we are currently in a stockout situation awaiting the first shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 134, Period 2 was 79, and Period 3 was 124. Current demand samples listed in the system description (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) seem to be a pre-populated list, whereas the game history shows different realized values. I will prioritize the game history for the immediate trend. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (147 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a delay in lead time (L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given the stockout (ending on-hand=0, sold=0), it is critical to ensure we are ordering enough to cover the pipeline. Since the backend OR uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and we have zero on-hand with significant in-transit (348 units), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the game history demand (approx 112 per period) across the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent game demand. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the observed delay from Period 1's expected arrival, which increases the protection level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of Period 1 and Period 3 orders during Period 4, which resulted in an ending on-hand inventory of 51 units. The historical demand data (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) indicates a mean demand of 100.6. The lead time variability is high: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (promised 2), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period. This suggests a potentially unstable supply chain. Given the on-hand inventory (51) and the large in-transit pipeline (311), the current pipeline is significantly larger than the expected demand for the lead time plus review period ((2+1)*100.6 = 301.8). However, since lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to allow the OR engine to average observed lead times. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_5' to capture the full provided demand history, which averages 100.6 (the backend will multiply this by 1+L). For sigma_hat, 'recent_5' is used to account for the observed volatility (approx 27.8). This setup keeps the base stock responsive to the mean demand while acknowledging historical delivery fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 (average: 100.6). In Period 5, we stocked out because demand was 87 and starting on-hand was only 51. Lead time analysis is crucial: Promised LT is 2. Reality: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (LT=3), Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (LT=1). The Period 2 order (160 units) is now overdue (LT=4+). It did not arrive in Period 5 conclude. Total In-transit is 452, which covers orders from P2 (160), P4 (151), and P5 (141). Since the P2 order is significantly delayed, the backend inventory logic (on-hand + in-transit) believes we have 452 units, but these are stuck in the pipeline. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the likely reality of a longer lead time, and use recent_N for demand forecasting to capture the current mean (approx 100). This helps the OR engine calculate a higher base stock to account for the longer lead time and recent stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, demand for chips(Regular) over 6 periods has been [134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102], with an average of approximately 110.5. Inventory is currently 0, with 495 units in transit. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2. However, we have observed actual lead times of 3 (for the P1 order) and 1 (for the P3 order). The order from P2 (160 units) is still missing\u2014it was ordered 5 periods ago, which is significantly beyond the promised 2 and the observed max of 3, suggesting it may be a lost shipment. Consequently, 'In-transit' likely overstates actual expected arrivals. Since 'In-transit' is 495 (P2: 160, P4: 151, P5: 141, P6: 43), and P2 is likely lost, the effective pipeline is closer to 335. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variations (1 and 3), and use recent_N (N=6) for demand to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility, as 0 units on hand and 0 sold in the last period due to stockouts necessitates a robust base stock.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Analyzing the demand history (approximate mean of 101 units/period) and lead time history. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 151 units/3 periods. P2 (ordered 160) and P5 (ordered 141) are currently outstanding. Specifically, the P2 order is now 6 periods old (overdue by 4 periods vs promised), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. To protect against this uncertainty and the stockouts seen in Periods 1-3 and 5-6, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the variance and 'recent_N' for demand to weight recent observations. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=7 to cover the available recorded history while excluding the seed samples if they differ from the game behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze the Lead Time (L) and Demand patterns for chips(Regular). Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods (Average = 2.5). The promised lead time is 2, but 3/4 of fulfilled orders took 3 periods. To avoid stockouts due to underestimation of lead time, I will set L to 3 (recent lead time behavior). Average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 99.8 units/period. There is a slight downward trend in recent demand (P7: 48, P8: 86), but I'll maintain a steady forecast to ensure availability given the lead time volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand and sigma estimation to capture the full recent history while I set L=3 explicitly to manage the pipeline expectation.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is frequently 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2 (observed in P4, P7, P8). Demand mean is approximately 100 units/period with significant variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 127 units with 278 units in-transit. Analyzing the lead time history: observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1]. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual average is 2.2 periods. To be conservative and prevent stockouts given the volatility, I will use an explicit L of 3. Demand over the last 9 periods has averaged 93.6 units/period (134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48, 86, 46). There is a slight downward trend in the last three periods (mean ~60), but historical peaks reach 137. To avoid under-ordering, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the broader distribution while acknowledging the variability. With L=3, the mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 9 samples to reflect the observed standard deviation of ~33 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 68 units on-hand and 305 in-transit. Historical lead times show high variability: while the promised lead time is 2, we have seen lead times of 1 and 3 periods (P1 took 3, P3 took 1, P4 took 3, P5 took 3, P8 took 1). The average lead time from observed conclusions is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2. Given this variance, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average valid historical arrivals. For demand forecasting, the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a distinct slowdown compared to the start: demand was 102, 48, 86, 46, 59 (average ~68.2). This is significantly lower than the ~100 average observed in earlier periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower demand regime and prevent excessive inventory accumulation while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average decreased from ~112 to ~68 (-39%). Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

From P1-P5, demand averaged ~112 units; from P6-P11, demand has averaged ~75 units (though P11 saw a spike to 113). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 305 units in-transit. Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.33 based on arrivals from P4, P7, P8, P9). Specifically, orders from P10 (27 units) and P11 (0 units) are pending, but we also have earlier unfulfilled orders. To remain robust against lead time uncertainty (which frequently hits 3 periods), I will set L to an explicit value of 3. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent window of 6 periods (P6-P11) to capture the lower post-shift average, and use default sigma calculation to account for the recent high volatility (std of recent samples is significant relative to the mean).

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Period 6-11 average demand is 75.6 (reduced from prior 112). Lead time continues to be unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6-12) shows an average demand of approximately 75 units per period, down from the initial ~112. The lead time (L) is highly unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12) despite a promise of 2 periods. To protect against this volatility and the frequent stockouts observed (P1-P3, P5-P6, P11), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the actual upper bound of lead time. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent window (N=7) to capture the lower demand mean (~75) of the current regime. This combination will result in a base stock that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand, providing a buffer against the unreliable supply chain.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6-13) shows a mean of 77.75 units per period (102, 48, 86, 46, 59, 113, 68, 118). This is significantly lower than the initial 5 periods (~112). Lead times have been highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (P4, P7, P8, P12 conclude) despite a promised 2. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and while 309 units are in-transit (orders from P12, P13, and likely leftover units from older periods), the stockout in P13 indicates we need to be more aggressive with our base stock to cover lead time variance. I will set L to 3 to reflect the frequent actual lead time and use recent data (N=8) to capture the lower demand regime and its volatility. This should help the OR engine set a higher safety stock to handle the unpredictable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Period 6-13 average demand is 77.75. Lead time continues to be unstable, frequently observed at 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6-14) shows an average demand of approximately 83 units per period (sum: 745 / 9 periods), which is a significant drop from the early period average (~112). However, demand in the last two periods (P13: 118, P14: 104) has spiked back toward previous levels, suggesting a potential high-demand swing or volatility increase. Lead times are highly unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (P4, P7, P8, P12), while promised is 2. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 369 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and potentially older unfilled orders if any, though P12-P14 orders total 166 units, meaning there are significant older pending arrivals). Given the stockout in P14 and rising demand, I am setting L to 3 to account for frequent delays and using N=9 (covering the current regime) for demand stats, while slightly increasing safety stock via sigma_hat to buffer against the unstable lead times and recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in Period 13-14 (avg 111 vs regime avg 83). Lead time confirmed as frequently 3 periods despite promised 2.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently proving to be 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, and P15), despite the promised 2. Demand has entered a higher volatility regime starting P13 (P13-P15 demand: 118, 104, 126; average 116), compared to the prior regime (P6-P12 average: 75). To protect against stock-outs during this 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent spike in demand (avg 116, so mu_hat for 1+L=4 periods should be ~464). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased variance in this new demand regime. Total in-transit is 329, which is below the expected 4-period demand, necessitating a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 13: average increased from ~75 to ~116 (+55%). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the majority of the last 10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we remain in a critical stockout situation (on-hand inventory=0). The demand regime shift noted in Period 16 is now extreme, with Period 16 demand hitting 368 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~116. This suggests a potential seasonal spike or a new high-demand regime. Lead times have consistently been 3 periods (observed in P16 for the P13 order, P15 for the P12 order, and multiple historical instances), which is longer than the promised 2. Currently, 408 units are in-transit, including the large order of 135 units from last period. To recover from the stockout and handle this new high-volatility demand, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the recent average demand of approximately 140/period over the last 5 periods (including the outlier 368) to ensure the OR engine targets a high enough base stock. Actual Lead time L is set to explicit 3 to account for the observed reliable delay. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike in Period 16 (368 units). Current demand regime (P13-P16) average is 179 units, up from 75 (+138%). Lead time remains stabilized at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $780.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a major demand surge. Demand in Period 16 was 368 and Period 17 was 297, compared to the previous regime average of ~116 (and a prior regime of ~75). The current high-demand regime (P13-P17) shows average demand of 202.6 units/period. The lead time is frequently 3 periods (observed in 7 of the last 10 arrivals), although a fast 1-period arrival occurred in P17. To prevent stockouts during this spike, I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*average demand of the last 5 periods (approx 4 * 203 = 812) to capture the current trend. sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std of last 5 periods is ~125, so sqrt(4)*125 = 250). Despite an 'In-transit' of 561 units (mostly from the P17 order), the inventory on-hand is 0, so a robust base-stock is necessary to cover the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: average increased from ~75 to over 200 units (+166%). Lead time remains predominantly 3 periods despite occasional outliers.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a significant pipeline of 964 units. Recent demand has undergone a major regime shift starting at Period 13. The demand for Periods 13-18 was [118, 104, 126, 368, 297, 251], with the last three periods showing a massive surge. The average demand across this 6-period regime (N=6) is 210.6. The lead time (L) has predominantly settled at 3 periods, although Period 17 saw an arrival with a 1-period lead time. Using L=3 is safer to ensure the OR backend calculates a total coverage for (L+1)=4 periods. Given the high volatility (std dev) and the risk of stockouts during this surge, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this new higher-demand level while allowing the OR engine to buffer appropriately via sigma.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: average increased from ~75 to 210.6 (+180%). Actual lead time continues to cluster around 3 periods with occasional outliers.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. The current demand regime (starting Period 13) shows a significant increase: P13-P19 demand values are 118, 104, 126, 368, 297, 251, 177, averaging approximately 205.8 units/period. The spike in P16-P18 suggests a high-demand phase, potentially seasonal. Although demand dropped to 177 in P19, it remains well above the previous regime's average (~75). For L, although the promised lead time is 2, historical data (last 10 periods) shows arrivals at P12(L=3, L=2), P15(L=3), P16(L=3), and P17(L=3, L=1). The most frequent lead time is 3 periods. We use L=3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers the actual lead time. For mu_hat, we use recent_N=7 to capture the demand shift since Period 13. For sigma_hat, we also use recent_N=7 to account for the high volatility observed in this new regime (standard deviation is much higher than before). On-hand is currently 0 with 1029 units in transit, suggesting recent large orders (P17: 348, P18: 403) have not yet arrived.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 13, increasing from an average of ~83 to over 210 units. Recent periods (P16-P20) show even higher activity with several spikes exceeding 300 units; the average since Period 13 is approximately 228 units per period. Lead times are unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16, P17) despite the promised 2. Currently, there is a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline (1029 units). Orders from P17 (348 units), P18 (403 units), and P19 (65 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 3-period lead time trend, the P17 order (placed P17) is expected to arrive during P20 resolution (visible P21) or P21 resolution (visible P22). To account for the higher demand and lead time variability, I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=8 (periods 13-20) to capture the current high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=8 to reflect the significantly increased volatility observed since Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 has averaged 228 units (increase from prior ~75). Period 20 demand (356) confirms sustained high-volume/high-volatility stage.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13-21) shows a significant average of approximately 236 units per period, with considerable volatility. Period 21 demand was 327. Inventory is currently critical, with 0 on-hand and 1081 in-transit, though no shipments arrived from Period 18-21. This suggests a bottleneck or lead-time extension. Historically, lead times have clustered around 3 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method (N=9, covering the Period 13-21 shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume/high-volatility regime. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to reflect the consistent reality of 3-period lead times seen in history, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering four periods (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 further refined: average is 236 units/period (up from prior ~75). Period 18-21 arrivals are overdue if L=2, confirming the trend that actual lead time is at least 3 periods during high-demand stages.

In Period 23, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a massive backlog of unfulfilled demand. Since Period 13, the demand regime has shifted significantly upwards, now averaging approximately 240 units per period (P13-P22 average is ~240, with recent periods P20-P22 averaging 319). Currently, 1124 units are in-transit, representing orders from P17 through P22. Note that orders from P18 onwards (18, 19, 21, 22) have not yet arrived, confirming the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, and potentially longer due to the bottleneck. To address this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to align with historical lead-time clusters during high-demand stages. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since P13, which averages 240/period. This will calculate mu_hat as (1+3)*240 = 960. Given the high pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy will likely throttle new orders, but setting these parameters ensures the target base stock reflects the new demand reality once the current 'in-transit' wave arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 confirmed at ~240 units/period (219% increase from prior regime). Lead time during high-volume periods is consistently 3+ periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P13-P23) shows a significant increase to an average of ~251 units/period, with high volatility (observed demand: 118, 104, 126, 368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, 360). Although some small orders from P21 and P22 arrived quickly, large orders from P17 (348 units) and P18 (403 units) remain in-transit and are now overdue (P17 order is at lead time 6+, P18 is at 5+), indicating severe congestion or possible loss. On-hand inventory is 0. To protect against this instability and high demand, I will set L to 4 (explicitly higher than promised to account for the current bottleneck) and mu_hat to cover the high-demand regime since Period 13 (N=11) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the recent volume shift and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 13 (P13-P23) average confirmed at ~251 units/period (+223% vs previous regime). Extreme lead time instability observed: while small orders arrive in 1-2 periods, large orders (P17, P18 totaling 751 units) are currently overdue by 3+ periods relative to the typical 3-period actual lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25. The demand regime since Period 13 shows a significant increase, with the average demand (P13-P24) now at approximately 245 units/period. The most recent demand sample in Period 24 was 176, but the regime is characterized by high volatility (peaks over 350). Inventory management is critical as on-hand is 0 and we have a massive pipeline of 1447 units, including several large overdue orders from Periods 17 and 18. Actual lead times have been highly unstable; while some small recent orders (P21, P22) arrived in 1-2 periods, the large orders that constitute the bulk of the pipeline are still missing after 6-7 periods. Because of this extreme lead-time bifurcation (small orders fast, large orders very slow/delayed), I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and calculating demand based on the 'recent_N' 12 periods (P13-P24) to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to account for the high volatility. The OR backend will see the huge in-transit pipeline and likely place a zero or minimal order, which is appropriate given the 1447 units already in-transit versus an expected (L+1) demand of ~980 units.

Carry-over insight: Extreme lead-time bifurcation observed: small orders (P21, P22) arrive in 1-2 periods, while large orders (P17, P18) exceed 7 periods of lead time without concluding.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 13, with current demand (P13-P25) averaging 259.5 units/period and high volatility (standard deviation ~101). A massive backlog of lost or significantly delayed orders exists: specifically orders from P17 (348 units) and P18 (403 units) are now 8-9 periods overdue, far exceeding the typical actual lead time of 3 periods. Concurrently, small orders (P21, P22, P23) continue to arrive within 1-2 periods. This bifurcation suggests the pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units that may never arrive. Consequently, despite 1441 units in-transit, the system remains at 0 on-hand inventory and fails to satisfy demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods to capture the current high-demand state. I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the consistent operational delay observed for successful deliveries, while acknowledging that the OR backend will subtract the (likely lost) pipeline from the target stock.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline stagnation: Large orders from P17 and P18 (751 units total) are now 8+ periods overdue, suggesting they are lost or indefinitely delayed. Small orders continue to arrive in 1-2 periods. Demand regime (P13-P25) average is ~260 units/period with high volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand (Regime P13-P26 average ~260) and severe pipeline inventory distress. There is a confirmed bifurcation in lead times: small orders (e.g., P21, P22, P23) arrive within 1-2 periods, while large orders from Period 17 (348 units) and Period 18 (403 units) are now 9 and 8 periods overdue respectively. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these likely lost/indefinitely stalled 'Large' orders as 'In-transit' inventory (which would suppress new ordering), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high-demand context and the pipeline failure. I am keeping L at 3 (the observable actual lead time for functioning shipments) and mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 260 = 1040. Since the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (1441) from the base stock, and 1441 > 1040, the OR engine would naturally order 0. However, the system needs arrivals. Given current on-hand is 0 and 751 units are 'frozen', I will use the 'explicit' method to force a mu_hat that overcomes the pipeline gap and triggers the order-limiting 'cap' logic to ensure a steady trickle of new, small inventory is ordered despite the stagnant pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost orders confirmed: P17 (348 units) and P18 (403 units) have exceeded 9 periods since ordering without arrival, effectively removed from meaningful pipeline. Small orders (under 100 units) still arrive within 1-2 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system represents a high-demand regime starting Period 13, currently averaging ~268 units/period (P13-P27). Demand volatility is extreme, with peaks up to 394. A critical supply chain observation persists: large orders (P17: 348, P18: 403) are now 10+ periods overdue and confirmed as lost, while smaller orders arrive in 1-3 periods. To prevent the OR 'pipeline_inventory' logic from suppressing new orders due to these phantom 'lost' units, I am intentionally setting a very high 'explicit' mu_hat. The in-transit total of 1927 includes 751 lost units; therefore, the effective pipeline is 1176. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the 1176 phantom units, the base stock (mu_hat) must exceed 1176 + safety stock. I set L=2 (reflecting current successful arrivals) and mu_hat=2600 (approx. (1+L)*866) to force the OR backend to reconcile and place an order to meet the current high-demand reality. sigma_hat is set to explicit high volatility to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: Large orders from P17 & P18 (751 total) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Effective replenishment only occurs with orders <100 units or significantly increased base stock targets to override the stale in-transit count.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by extreme pipeline contamination and shipment loss. Orders from P17 (348 units), P18 (403 units), and P24 (412 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (totaling 3021 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit count from the base stock to determine the order size, it will effectively stop ordering unless it's forced to target a base stock higher than the stale pipeline. The current demand regime (P13-P28) has an average of ~268 units/period. With a likely actual lead time of 3 periods, a standard base stock (L+1=4 periods of demand) would be approximately 1072 units + safety stock. However, since there are 3021 'phantom' units in transit, the OR backend will calculate 'Base Stock - 3021', resulting in an order of 0. To 'force' a replenishment of ~1000 units (roughly 3-4 periods of demand), I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the lost units plus the desired inventory. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 4000 (roughly 3000 stale pipeline + 1000 desired stock) to try and overcome the pipeline block. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to match confirmed high-volume delivery speeds seen in previous successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage confirmed: Backend in-transit count contains over 2500 units of likely lost shipments (P17, P18, P24, P27, P28). Orders must be scaled to 'override' the stale in-transit count to trigger any new shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1119.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by a massive 'in-transit' inventory count (3,647 units) caused by lost shipments (specifically Period 17, 18, 24, and 28), which prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. The 'In-transit' count must be bypassed by setting an extremely high explicit 'mu_hat'. The demand regime since Period 13 is averaging approximately 280 units per period (P13-P29 mean: ~254, but recent peaks are higher). To force an order that covers the 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4), and to offset the ~3,650 units currently 'in-transit', I will set an explicit mu_hat near 4,800 units. This allows the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) to result in a positive order. I am using L=3 based on consistent historical observation of actual lead times for significant shipments.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage remains severe; backend in-transit includes ~3600 units of lost/stale shipments. Parameter mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' values > 4500 to trigger replenishment orders. Observed demand (P24-P29) remains high at ~300 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-114.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 1030 units on-hand after receiving the large order from Period 28. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (3710) is significantly inflated by lost or indefinitely delayed orders (specifically P17, P18, P24, and now potentially P29). Since the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' logic subtracts these stale units, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat (the target level) is set higher than the stale pipeline. Average demand in the current high-demand regime is ~300 units/period. To ensure continuous replenishment and override the ~3700 units of 'phantom' inventory while maintaining safety stock for high volatility, mu_hat is set explicitly to 4800. This target level accounts for the expected demand over a 3-period lead time plus a significant buffer to trigger orders despite the blocked pipeline. L is set to explicit 3 to match the high-demand lead-time trend.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage remains severe; backend in-transit (3710) includes ~2600+ units of lost/stale shipments (P17, P18, P24). mu_hat must remain >4500 to override these and trigger replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a 'pipeline blockage' where large orders placed around Period 17 and 18 (totaling 751 units) and Period 24 (412 units) are either lost or significantly delayed, yet they remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' count. This suppresses new orders because the system thinks sufficient stock is coming. However, orders from Period 27 (486 units) and Period 28 (1094 units) successfully arrived in Period 29 and 30, bringing on-hand inventory to 795 units after Period 31 demand. Current demand (P28-P31) fluctuates between 229 and 331 units, averaging ~279. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains a high service level while dealing with stale in-transit data (currently 3887 units), mu_hat must be set as an explicit 'target' that exceeds the stale pipeline. Base stock = mu_hat + safety stock. With roughly 2600+ units confirmed lost (P17, P18, P24, plus likely P29/P30 delays), and a desired base stock of roughly 1200 units (4 periods of 300 demand), mu_hat needs to be set around 4800 to override the 3887 in-transit and trigger a replenishment. This keeps the 'effective' order flow moving despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory contains approx 2600 units of lost shipments (P17, P18, P24). Replenishment is only triggered when mu_hat is set high enough to exceed this stale count. Current demand regime (P24-P31) is ~295 units/period.

Specifically, P30 (1,157 units) is now 3 periods past its decision and should have arrived if lead time was 2. The pipeline is significantly contaminated with these stale records. To trigger replenishment that accounts for the current demand regime (~295 units/period) and a lead time of roughly 2 periods, the OR backend's 'base stock' calculation (mu_hat) must exceed the stale in-transit count. On-hand inventory is 678, which covers about 2.3 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat to 4,800 to ensure we trigger an order to maintain safety stock despite the pipeline blockage. Sigma_hat is set to track recent volatility (P24-P32).

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains blocked by ~2,200 units of lost/stale shipments (P17, P18, P24, P30). mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' values > 4500 to override these and trigger replenishment. Demand regime is stable at ~295 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P24-P33) has stabilized at approximately 287 units per period. The backend in-transit inventory currently stands at 3,948 units. This includes approximately 2,200 units from older, large orders (P17, P18, P24) that have not arrived for 10+ periods and are treated as lost. Consequently, the backend logic subtracts these 'phantom' units from its replenishment calculation. To trigger an order that maintains our stock levels against the actual demand of ~287/period and an observed lead time of 1-3 periods, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that overrides this stale pipeline. With on-hand at 681 and confirmed lost units at ~2200, we need a base stock level (mu_hat) high enough to command new units. I will set mu_hat to 5000 and sigma_hat to 600 to ensure the OR logic places a replenishment order despite the pipeline blockage. I am using 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the higher-volume lead time characteristic, though recent small orders have arrived in 1 period.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persistent: ~2200 units from P17, P18, P24 are effectively lost. Recent demand (P24-P33) remains stable at ~287 units/period. Small orders (<500 units) currently exhibiting 1-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline blockage due to lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 17 (348 units), Period 18 (403 units), Period 24 (412 units), and Period 30 (1157 units), totaling approximately 2,320 units that will likely never arrive. With a current In-transit count of 4,824 and an On-hand of 496, the OR backend's calculated base_stock (typically ~1,200 for L=3 and mean=300) is far below the perceived pipeline inventory. Consequently, the backend will not place orders unless the mu_hat parameter is set high enough to override these 'ghost' units. Current demand (P24-P34) remains stable at an average of 283 units/period, but volatility is high. Small recent orders are arriving with a lead time of 1-2 periods. To ensure a new replenishment order is generated to cover demand for the next 3-4 periods (Review + Lead Time), mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' at a level exceeding the blocked pipeline (approx 4,800-5,000 units). Setting mu_hat to 5500 reflects the need to clear the ~4,800 stale in-transit units and provide a buffer for actual future demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained pipeline blockage: ~2300 units from P17, P18, P24, and P30 are clinically lost; mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values > 5000 to trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P24-P34) average is 283 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1054.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a major pipeline blockage. There are roughly 2,300 units from older orders (P17, P18, P24, P30) that are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed but still count toward 'in-transit' in the backend. Currently, in-transit is 5,100 units. To trigger a new order, the target base stock (mu_hat) must exceed the sum of on-hand (186) and in-transit (5,100). Recent demand (P24-P35) remains stable at approximately 285 units/period. Small orders have recently shown a 1-period lead time. To ensure the backend places an order to cover upcoming demand and clear the current stock-out risk (on-hand is only 186 while demand is ~285), I will set mu_hat to 6,000. This 'overrides' the stale 5,100 in-transit units and targets a net replenishment of approximately 700-800 units, which covers roughly 2-3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage continues: ~2,300 units (P17, P18, P24, P30) are lost/stale. mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' values > 5500 to overcome total 'in-transit' and trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P24-P35) average is 283 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P24-P36) remains stable with an average of approximately 285 units per period. The primary challenge continues to be a massive pipeline blockage: 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 5013 units, but at least 2300-2600 of these (from P17, P18, P24, P30) are clinically lost or indefinitely delayed as they have far exceeded even the worst-case actual lead times. To trigger new replenishment orders from the OR backend (which subtracts the full pipeline from its target), the mu_hat parameter must be set explicitly to a value higher than the current stale in-transit count plus the desired cycle stock. I am increasing mu_hat to 6500 to comfortably override the 5013 in-transit units and ensure a fresh shipment is placed to maintain on-hand inventory, which is currently healthy at 805 units but will deplete in ~3 periods. Small recent orders (P31, P32, P34) show that the supply chain is functioning for new, smaller shipments with 1-2 period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2600 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. Total in-transit (5013) is unreliable; mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' values > 6000 to trigger orders. Current demand regime (P24-P36) average is 285 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-335.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a major pipeline blockage. There are roughly 2,600 units (from orders in Periods 17, 18, 24, and 30) that have not arrived for many periods beyond their expected lead time and are almost certainly lost. However, they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (4704 units). To trigger any NEW orders, the 'base_stock' must exceed this 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' (1563 units). Currently, the 'on-hand' + 'stale in-transit' is already ~6,267. Demand is steady at approximately 290 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to 6800 to ensure the policy attempts to maintain a target that overrides these stale numbers and ensures a small continuous flow of replenishments given that recent orders (P34-36) have actually been arriving within 1-2 periods. This high mu_hat is necessary to bypass the OR engine's 'inventory position' calculation that incorrectly counts lost units as available supply.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage updated: approximately 2,600 units (P17, P18, P24, P30) are confirmed lost/stale. Total visible in-transit is 4704, but only ~2,100 units (P37 onward) are likely to arrive. mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' values > 6500 to overcome the stale inventory position and trigger orders. Demand (P24-P37) remains stable at ~290 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P38) remains stable at an average of approximately 277 units/period, while the long-term regime since P13 is ~250. However, the system's in-transit count (5302) is still heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (specifically ~2300 units from Period 17, 18, 24, and 30 that will likely never arrive). Recent deliveries (P36, P37) show that small-to-mid orders placed recently are arriving with a lead time of 1-2 periods. To ensure replenishment triggers despite the stale in-transit count, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value high enough to encompass (Existing Stale In-Transit + Required Safety Stock + Demand during Lead Time). Given total in-transit is 5302 and we want to maintain stock for ~300 demand/period across a 3-period lead-time window plus buffer, I am setting mu_hat to 7000. This deliberate 'over-calculation' is necessary to bypass the OR backend's (base_stock - in_transit) logic which is currently blinded by the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2300 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values >7000 to overcome total in-transit and trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P34-P38) average is 277 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-339.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The pipeline blockage remains a defining factor. Total in-transit is 5235, but approximately 2300 units (from P17, P18, P24, P30) are clinically lost or indefinitely delayed. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order, the mu_hat parameter must be set higher than the combined on-hand (1535) and 'effective' in-transit inventory. Recent demand (P34-P39) is stable, averaging ~280 units/period. Following the strategy of progressively increasing the explicit mu_hat to overcome the stale in-transit count, I am setting mu_hat to 7500. This compensates for the ~2300 units of 'phantom' inventory plus the current on-hand stock and ensures the service level remains high during this sustained high-demand regime (~300 units/period). Lead time for non-lost orders is currently averaging 1.5 periods, so keeping L=2 (promised) is appropriate for the calculation logic.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2300 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values > 7500 to overcome stale in-transit count and trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P34-P39) remains stable at approximately 280 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1071.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The pipeline blockage remains a significant factor, with approximately 2,300-2,600 units from older orders (P17, P18, P24, P30) being effectively lost or indefinitely delayed. The current on-hand inventory is 1,867 units, and the visible in-transit is 5,500 units. However, based on recent periods, actual demand is stable at approximately 280-300 units per period. I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value high enough to overcome the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' count (which includes these lost units) to ensure replenishment continues as needed. Recent small orders are arriving with a 1-2 period lead time. To trigger a new order that maintains our safety stock against a 290-unit demand mean, I am increasing mu_hat to 8000. This is necessary because the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit'. If 'base_stock' (from mu_hat + safety) is less than 'in-transit' (5500), no order is placed. By setting mu_hat to 8000, we force the base stock calculation to exceed the stale in-transit count.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains robust, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging approx 284 units/period. On-hand inventory is healthy at 1581 units. However, the in-transit tally (6197 units) remains heavily inflated by lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 17, 18, 24, and 30, which account for approximately 2300 units. To maintain order flow through the OR backend's capped base-stock logic, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that overrides this stale pipeline. With total in-transit at 6197 and demand around 300, setting mu_hat to 8000 ensures the system calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new replenishment orders despite the 'phantom' inventory. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have balanced between 1 and 2 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 20 periods to capture the high volatility seen in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2300 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values > 8000 to overcome the stale in-transit count of 6197 and trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P37-P41) remains stable at approximately 284 units/period.

The primary challenge remains the systemic 'pipeline blockage' caused by approximately 2,300 units from older, stale orders (P17, P18, P24, P30) that haven't arrived and are likely lost. Total in-transit is reported at 6,513, but the effective in_transit is likely much lower (~4,213). To trigger the OR backend to place necessary replenishment orders, the mu_hat parameter must be set 'explicitly' to a value that exceeds the total stale in-transit count plus the desired safety stock. Given current on-hand of 1,350 and demand around 280, I am setting mu_hat to 8,500. This provides a buffer against the 6,513 in-transit and 1,350 on-hand, ensuring the system continues to order to cover the ~273-unit demand trend while ignoring the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2,300 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values > 8500 to overcome the stale in-transit count of 6513 and trigger replenishment. Recent demand (P34-P42) remains stable at approximately 273 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime since Period 13, currently averaging approximately 280 units per period (P34-P43). Inventory management continues to be complicated by a significant 'pipeline blockage' caused by lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 17, 18, 24, and 30, totaling approximately 2,300 units. These units appear in the backend's 'In-transit' count (6,418 units) but will never arrive. To trigger new replenishment orders, the OR backend's target base stock (mu_hat) must be explicitly set to a value that exceeds this stale in-transit count plus the desired buffer for future demand. The current on-hand inventory is 1,931 units. With a recent lead time of 1-3 periods, a mu_hat of 9,000 is used to ensure the order placement mechanism overcomes the 6,418 'in-transit' units and accounts for 3-4 periods of demand (~1,100 units) plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2,300 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values > 9000 to overcome the stale in-transit count and trigger replenishment as we approach the final 5 periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1393.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 50. The core challenge is a massive 'in-transit' inventory blockage (approx. 6,459 units), of which roughly 2,300 units from Periods 17, 18, 24, and 30 are clinically lost or indefinitely stalled. To trigger any new orders from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds this total pipeline + current on-hand (2,381). Recent demand (P34-P44) has been stable at approximately 264 units per period. With only 5 periods remaining, we have a significant on-hand inventory buffer (2,381 units), which at current demand rates covers nearly 9 periods. Therefore, we do not technically need more stock to finish the game. However, because the backend logic requires clearing the 'pipeline' inventory hurdle to register any replenishment, and because we want to maintain the specific strategy that overcomes the blockage, I will set mu_hat to 9500 to ensure we stay above the staleness threshold, while acknowledging that our current 2381 units on hand should be sufficient for the remaining horizon.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persists: ~2,300 units from P17, P18, P24, P30 are lost/stale. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' values > 9500 to overcome the stale in-transit count and trigger potential replenishment in the final periods. Current on-hand (2381) is sufficient for the remaining 5 periods given avg demand ~265.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. The game is nearing its end. Current on-hand inventory is 3,108 units. The average demand for the most recent stable regime (P34-P45) is approximately 260 units per period. With 5 periods remaining (including this one), total expected demand is roughly 1,300 units (5 * 260). Our current on-hand inventory (3,108) significantly exceeds this requirement. To maximize reward, we must prioritize minimizing holding costs for the remainder of the session. The backend pipeline is still heavily 'blocked' by approximately 2,300 units of lost/stale shipments (P17, P18, P24, P30), bringing the visible in-transit to 6,167 units. However, because on-hand inventory alone covers more than 10 periods of demand, we should stop ordering entirely. We will set mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value to ensure no new orders are triggered, allowing the existing inventory to be sold off through Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1883.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. Current on-hand inventory is 2863 units. Given the stable demand regime (P24-P46) which averages approximately 275 units per period, the remaining total demand for the rest of the game (Periods 47, 48, 49, 50) is estimated at ~1100 units. Our current on-hand inventory (2863) is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more units now would only increase holding costs ($1.0/unit) without increasing sales, as the game ends at Period 50. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR engine places no further orders. To achieve this, I set mu_hat to a very low explicit value (1) and L to default, which will result in a base stock level far below our current on-hand + in-transit (effectively blocking new orders).

Carry-over insight: End-of-game phase: On-hand inventory (2863) exceeds estimated remaining demand (~1100 units) for Periods 47-50; no further orders required to maximize profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1298.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final phase of the game (Period 48 of 50). The current on-hand inventory is 2550 units. Historical demand in the current regime (starting around Period 24) has stabilized around an average of 280-300 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, and 50), the total expected demand is approximately 840-900 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 2550 is nearly triple the maximum expected remaining demand. Ordering more units at this stage would only increase holding costs without increasing sales, as the demand will be fully satisfied by the existing stock. The in-transit pipeline (6167 units) remains heavily contaminated with old lost shipments and more recent orders that are no longer necessary. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed for the remainder of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-995.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game (total 50 periods). The objective is to maximize profit (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory). Current status: On-hand inventory is 2239 units. Average demand in the current regime (approx. Period 34-48) is 265 units/period. The remaining demand for Period 49 and Period 50 is estimated to be approximately 530 units (265 * 2). Our current on-hand inventory (2239) is significantly higher than the projected total remaining demand. Placing any further orders would only increase holding costs for Period 49 and Period 50 without increasing sales, thereby reducing total reward. Therefore, we maintain a zero-order strategy by setting parameters that result in a base stock lower than the current inventory plus pipeline. As previously noted, the pipeline inventory (In-transit: 6167) is heavily contaminated by lost shipments from earlier periods (P17, P18, P24, etc.), but since we do not want to order, this blockage is no longer a hindrance we need to override.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-659.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision point (Period 50). The current on-hand inventory is 1923 units. Historical demand during this high-volume regime (Periods 47-49) has been approximately 313 units/period. For the final period (Period 50), the expected demand is roughly 313 units. Since on-hand inventory (1923) is significantly greater than the expected remaining demand, no further orders are required. Ordering at this stage would only increase holding costs without providing additional sales revenue, as any order placed now would not arrive before the game concludes (promised lead time is 2, while only 1 period remains). Thus, L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to default/minimal settings, which combined with the high on-hand and in-transit values, will result in a zero order from the OR backend.
