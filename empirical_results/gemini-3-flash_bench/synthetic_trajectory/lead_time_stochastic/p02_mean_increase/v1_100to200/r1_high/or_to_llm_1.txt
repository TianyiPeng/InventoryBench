The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message.

Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 388 in the pipeline vs. a base stock level calculation for a 2-period lead time. However, since P1's order is late, there is a stockout. Even if P1's order arrives in P4, we have missed 3 periods of sales. I need to ensure that once the pipeline starts 'clogging' or arriving, I don't over-order, but I also need to account for potential 3-period lead times.

The P2 order (placed 4 periods ago) should have arrived by now; the fact that it hasn't appeared in 'conclude' messages suggests it might be delayed or lost.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand [141, 118, 67, 94, 89] and recent sales [91, 130, 114, 118, 106] show a fairly stable mean around 100-110 units. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests 102 units based on a LT of 2. 5. Strategy: With only 21 units on-hand and uncertainty regarding the P2 order (143 units), there is a risk of stockout if demand exceeds 21 in the current period (which it likely will).

However, with 0 on-hand and multiple orders potentially delayed or lost, there is a risk of a stockout gap if current pipeline shipments don't arrive soon. However, 1200 units in pipeline vs a demand of ~200/period means we have ~6 periods of supply in-transit. Even if some are lost, ordering more now adds to a massive oversupply risk if the clog clears.

P27 demand was lower (122), but we must prepare for the established mean of 190. \n4.

The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the raw 'In-transit' figure (1505), but it fails to account for the ~1100 lost units.\n4. **Strategy**: Target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) at 180 units/period = 540 units.
