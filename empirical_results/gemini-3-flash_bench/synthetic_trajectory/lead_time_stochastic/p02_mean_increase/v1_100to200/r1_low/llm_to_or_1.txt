Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [141, 118, 67, 94, 89], yielding a mean of 101.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. Since the OR backend uses L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Using the mean of all samples (default calculation method) would result in a mu_hat of ~305.4 and sigma_hat of ~49.4. Given the item (chips) and the initial stage, I will stick to the default statistics provided by the samples to establish a baseline. No seasonal or calendar information is available yet to adjust forecast explicitly.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 149 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 91, units sold 0). The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 149. The demand samples provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) show a mean of 101.8 and a standard deviation of 28.5. In Period 1, the actual demand was 91, which aligns with the historical average. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to use all historical data points for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and 'default' for L since we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders from Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit (Total 292). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Currently, on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales for Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) average 101.8. Recent demand in the simulation (P1=91, P2=130) averages 110.5. Since we have very few samples and no evidence yet of lead-time deviation (as P1's arrival should only be confirmed at the start of P4), I will stick to the default lead time and a conservative average of the 5 pre-game and 2 game samples (Total 7 samples) to forecast demand. The backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) demand. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the target base stock is the median demand over the protection interval.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 91, Period 2 was 130, and Period 3 was 114. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0, and on-hand inventory remains 0, meaning we have had zero sales despite positive demand. This indicates the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (order P1 arrives during P4, visible P5) or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have 313 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3: 149+143+21 = 313) and 0 on-hand, we are in a stockout. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For demand, the first three periods average ~111.7 units. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level effectively while the OR engine calculates the base stock to cover the adjusted lead time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (mean = 101.8). However, observed sales data in the 'conclude' messages suggests actual demand encountered was 91, 130, 114, 118 (mean = 113.25). Standard deviation is approximately 16.5. Lead time observation: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. On-hand inventory is 52, and 277 units are in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). To ensure coverage over the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3), we need to set parameters that target a base stock sufficient for ~3 periods. Based on the mean of ~102 and L=2, mu_hat should target (2+1)*102 = 306. I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat, and recent_N for mu_hat to capture the current demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable, with samples of 91, 130, 114, 118, and 106 (Mean \u2248 112). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 277 units (consisting of the Period 2 order of 143 units and the Period 4 order of 134 units). Looking at lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and the Period 3 order also arrived in Period 4 (L=1), suggesting high variability around the promised L=2. The Period 2 order (143 units) is now overdue if L=2, but consistent with the L=3 observation from Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 6. Because we are currently out of stock and demand is steady, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the latest system performance. I'm setting N=5 for demand to use all available samples. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed L=3 and L=1, or 'recent_N' with N=2 to weigh both recent varied arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and 413 units are in-transit. Historic demand (Periods 1-6) shows a mean of approximately 101 units/period (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46). Notably, Period 6 saw a drop to 46 units, which might be an outlier or a shift. Lead times have been volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods (promised 2), P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2/P4 orders are still outstanding. P2 (ordered P2) is now 4 periods late (overdue). P4 (ordered P4) is at L=2 and should have arrived in P6 but didn't. This suggests the actual lead time is likely averaging closer to 2-3 periods with high variance/unreliability. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the engine integrate observed arrivals. For demand forecasting, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent mean of 101. Given the supply instability (stockouts in P1-P3 and P6) and holding cost vs profit being 1:1 (requiring a 50% service level base stock), the pipeline inventory of 413 units (approx 4 periods of demand) is currently high. The parameters will aim to stabilize the inventory position once the late shipments arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (8 periods) shows values: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, plus earlier samples 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. Mean demand is approximately 100 units. Lead time analysis: P1 arrived P4 (L=3), P3 arrived P4 (L=1), P2 is currently missing/lost (ordered 143 in P2, should have arrived by P5 if L=3), P4 arrived P7 (L=3). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations suggest a mode of 3 or delivery instability. P2's order of 143 units is likely lost as it hasn't arrived by P7. On-hand is 48. In-transit is 279 (comprised of P2: 143 [likely lost] and P6: 136). Because the OR engine calculates pipeline as on-hand + in-transit (48 + 279 = 327), and P2's 143 units are likely never arriving, the engine will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon (approx 400 units), I will set L to 3 and use a recent_N demand reflecting the current average of ~100. This increases the base stock target, mitigating the 'ghost' inventory from the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable with a mode of 3 (observed P1->P4, P4->P7). Period 2 shipment (143 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived at P4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived at P4 (L=1), and Period 4 arrived at P7 (L=3). The Period 2 order (143 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is considered lost. The lead time appears unstable but with a significant risk of L=3. Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 342, but since the P2 order is likely lost, effective pipeline is lower. I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for the observed delays. Demand has been fluctuating between 46 and 130 per period. The average demand over the 8 observed periods is ~99. Using N=5 for demand (recent_N) captures the most recent variability (Avg ~92, but includes a low of 46). I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon, protecting against the observed lead time extensions and the inventory deficit caused by the lost Period 2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 shipment (143 units) confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Actual lead time is frequently 3 periods instead of the promised 2.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory. The history shows a highly volatile lead time (observed values: 3, 1, 3, 1). The Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, as 8 periods have elapsed. The pipeline inventory is currently 305 units (consisting of orders from Periods 6, 9, and potentially 10). Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the frequent delays, providing a safety buffer. Demand (mu_hat) is calculated using the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9: 106, 46, 86, 103, 98) which averages ~88 per period. Since mu_hat = (1+L) * mean, and L=3, the value targets a 4-period window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and 'explicit' for L=3 to ensure the backend covers the demonstrated replenishment delays.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 352 units in transit. Historical demand is relatively stable, with an average of 102.9 units per period across 10 samples (range 46-137). However, lead times are volatile: actual observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 1], averaging 2 periods but oscillating between short and long durations. Crucially, the Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost as 9 periods have passed without arrival. Current in-transit units include orders from P6 (136 units, 5 periods ago - likely lost or severely delayed), P9 (26 units), and P10 (47 units). Total in-transit (352) is inflated by likely lost orders (143 + 136 = 279). Effective pipeline is likely closer to 73. To compensate for lost inventory and lead-time variance, I will set L explicitly to 3 to increase the base stock level (covering L+1 periods of demand), use the mean of the last 10 samples for mu_hat, and use the default standard deviation for sigma_hat to maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 6 shipment (136 units) likely lost (5 periods elapsed, previous max lead time was 3 periods).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out (0 on-hand) with 412 units in-transit. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant losses (Period 2 and Period 6 orders). Specifically, the Period 6 order (136 units) has now exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (it is now 5 periods overdue), confirming it is likely lost. The pipeline reflects 412 units: P6(136), P9(26), P10(47), P11(60), and P12(143 - calculated as current order from history). Since P6 is lost, the actual effective pipeline is much lower. I will set lead time (L) to 3 (the observed maximum) to provide more safety stock and higher base stock levels to compensate for the frequent stock-outs and unreliable supply. Demand has been relatively stable around 100 units/period (mean ~102); I will use recent_N=10 to capture this current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 shipment (136 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Actual lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 339 in-transit. Historic demand over 12 periods averages 100.2, with recent demand (last 4 periods) averaging ~102. Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods). Critically, two orders have been lost: Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (136 units). The current 'In-transit' of 339 units includes these lost shipments (143 + 136 = 279), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 60 units (the order from Period 11). Since 60 units is insufficient to cover the lead time (avg 2, plus review 1 = 3 periods of demand ~300), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the lost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. I use L=2 (promised) but boost mu_hat to 550 to force an order that compensates for the ~279 units of 'ghost' inventory while covering expected demand until the next arrival.

Carry-over insight: Two significant shipment losses confirmed: Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (136 units). These remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the default OR engine to under-order.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 102 units across the last 13 periods. However, supply chain reliability is poor. We have confirmed that orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (136 units) are lost. These 279 units remain in the 'In-transit' count (550 total), causing the OR backend to underestimate the actual pipeline inventory needed. Lead times are also inconsistent, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced multiple periods of stockouts, I need to adjust the OR parameters to account for the 'phantom' inventory and the lead time variability. I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) to ensure a higher service level. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value: the backend formula is (1+L)*mean_demand. With L=3, (1+3)*102 = 408. To compensate for the 279 units of 'lost' inventory that the backend incorrectly counts as incoming, I must add them to the mu_hat to force an order. Final mu_hat = 408 + 279 = 687. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a challenge where significant stockouts are occurring (on-hand is 0) despite some arrivals. In-transit inventory stands at 627, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (136 units). Total ghost inventory is 279 units. This 'phantom' stock tricks the OR engine into thinking the pipe is fuller than it is. I will use 'explicit' for L and mu_hat to account for the actual lead time instability (averaging 2.4 periods) and the need to over-order to compensate for the lost units. The mean demand across the last 10 periods is approximately 99 units. With an effective lead time (L) of 3, the forecast should cover (L+1) or 4 periods. 4 * 99 = 396. However, to clear the backlog and ignore the 279 lost units in the pipeline calculation, I will provide an explicit mu_hat targeting a higher base stock. Base stock = mu_hat + safety. By setting mu_hat high (700) using 'explicit', I force an order even though the OR backend thinks there are 627 units in-transit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage the stock for 'chips(Regular)'. Currently, we face two critical issues: 1) Significant inventory stockouts (on-hand is 0, sales were missed in Period 15), and 2) Ghost inventory in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (136 units) are confirmed lost (surpassing the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods) but still counted by the OR backend as supply. Total lost units = 279. This causes the backend to under-order. To compensate, I must increase 'mu_hat' to force a higher base stock that ignores these 279 phantom units. Average demand over the last 15 periods is ~101 units per period. With an average lead time of 2.25 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3), I'll set L to an explicit value of 3 to be conservative. The base stock required for (L+1) = 4 periods is roughly 404 units. To offset the 279 phantom units, I need to inflate the mu_hat. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (101 * 4) + 279 = 683, and sigma_hat to reflect the historical standard deviation (~26) scaled by sqrt(4), which is ~52.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory 'In-transit' remains at 279 units (P2 & P6 losses); parameter 'mu_hat' must be inflated by this amount until pipeline is cleared or adjusted.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we remain in a critical situation with zero on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts. Demand in Period 16 spiked to 273, significantly higher than the previous average (~100). The pipeline inventory of 489 units contains 279 units of 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P2 and P6), which the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming supply. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am forecasting a base demand of 110 units per period plus a 279-unit buffer to offset the lost shipments, totaling 389 units. I will set the lead time L to 'explicit' 3, as this is the most frequent actual lead time observed (P4, P9, P11, P13 all took 3 periods). mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * 110 + 279 = 719. However, giving the recent spike, I will lean slightly higher to ensure the OR engine places a significant order despite the phantom pipeline. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent high volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 16 (273 units) compared to historical average (~100). This may signal a new high-demand regime or a one-time event; monitoring for persistence.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing two major issues: phantom inventory and a recent demand spike. There are 279 units (Period 2 and Period 6) permanently lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine, causing under-ordering. Additionally, demand has surged from an average of ~100 to 273 (P16) and 170 (P17). To fix this, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate actual Lead Time (L) as 3, based on the most frequent historical observation. For mu_hat, I calculate the target base stock covering 4 periods (L+1). I forecast demand at 200/period due to the recent spike. Normally, base stock would be 200 * 4 = 800. To offset the 279 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 1079 (800 + 279). This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the 'In-transit' bloat. I set sigma_hat explicitly high (150) to account for the increased volatility and uncertainty of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely: Period 16 (273) and Period 17 (170) average 221, significantly higher than the previous 15-period average of 101. L=3 continues to be the most reliable lead time estimate despite promised L=2.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16: 273, P17: 170, P18: 232) is approximately 225 units, which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~100. Effective replenishment is hindered by significant phantom inventory: 279 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost but remain in the OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation. To compensate, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat'. Based on an expected lead time L=3, the OR backend requires demand for (L+1) = 4 periods. With a forecast of 225 units/period, base mu_hat is 900. To offset the 279 units of phantom inventory that prevent the backend from ordering, I add 279 to the base, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1179. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the consistent arrival delay observed in the last several successful shipments (P11, P13, P14 all took 3 periods). Sigma_hat is calculated using 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~225 (+125%) starting Period 16. Phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6) totals 279 units and must be offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 16; demand for the last four periods (273, 170, 232, 116) averages 197.75, which is roughly double the previous long-term average. We are using N=4 (the length of the new regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains erratic but frequently settles at 3 periods (observed for P13, P14, and several earlier orders), so L is set to 'explicit' value 3. We must also account for 'phantom inventory' (279 units from lost orders P2 and P6) which still appears in 'In-transit'. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this non-existent pipeline inventory, we inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation for mu_hat: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = (1 + 3) * 197.75 + 279 = 1070. Calculation for sigma_hat: sqrt(1 + 3) * std(273, 170, 232, 116) = 2 * 68.3 = 136.6.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~200. Lead time remains unstable (1 to 3 periods), with 3 being the most conservative estimate for current planning.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, with the average demand increasing from ~100 to approximately 191 units (last 5 periods: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164). Lead times are highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods), but 3 periods remains the most conservative planning horizon (L=3) to avoid stockouts. A critical issue is the 'Phantom Inventory': 279 units from lost orders in Period 2 (143) and Period 6 (136) are still listed as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to account for the current demand regime and include an offset to compensate for these 279 units that will never arrive. Using L=3, the review+lead period covers 4 periods of demand. Forecasted demand for 4 periods = 191 * 4 = 764. To neutralize the 279 units of phantom inventory in the pipeline, I set 'mu_hat' to 764 + 279 = 1043. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough physical units. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P20) mean is ~191 units. Phantom inventory from P2 and P6 (279 units total) persists in the pipeline and must be offset in mu_hat calculations until reconciled.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 16. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 189.17. However, the system is facing a massive 'out of stock' crisis (On-hand: 0) and high reported 'In-transit' (1179 units). This in-transit figure is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (Period 2 and Period 6 losses totaling 279 units) and recent massive orders from Periods 17 and 18 (298 and 394 units) that haven't arrived yet. Lead times are unstable (1-3 periods). To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy to trigger a replenishment order despite the inflated pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' high enough to exceed the perceived (In-transit + On-hand). The current reported pipeline is 1179. If I set L=3 (most conservative estimate), mu_hat (representing demand over L+1 periods) must be set via 'explicit' to offset the 279 units of lost orders and account for the high-demand regime (~190 units/period). Setting mu_hat to 1100 (approximately 190 * 4 + 340) to ensure the system keeps the supply moving despite the bottleneck.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state due to a combination of a sustained demand regime shift (average demand ~190 units since Period 16) and a breakdown in the supply chain. Analysis of the history shows that shipments from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 have not yet arrived. Specifically, the Period 15 order (73 units) is now 8 periods old, suggesting it is likely lost alongside the orders from Period 2 and Period 6. The total 'In-transit' figure of 1179 units contains significant phantom inventory (279 from P2/P6 and now potentially 73 from P15, plus the late orders from P17-P19). Lead times are highly unstable, with many orders exceeding the promised 2 periods; I will continue using an explicit L=3 to ensure a higher base stock. To combat the 'In-transit' inventory trap (where the OR engine sees phantom units and refuses to order), I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force a high order volume. Based on current demand (~190) and L=3, the (L+1) demand is 760. I set mu_hat to 1000 to overcome the phantom pipeline and restore on-hand inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Period 15 shipment (73 units) likely lost (8 periods elapsed). Total documented phantom inventory is now 352 units (P2, P6, P15). Demand remains in the high regime (approx. 190/period). Supply chain is highly congested or unreliable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. Total 'In-transit' inventory matches the sum of orders from P17-P19 (298+394+135=827) plus suspected phantom inventory (P2=143, P6=136, P15=73 total 352). Total (827+352=1179) confirms the system is counting these losses as active pipeline. To force the OR backend to order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand plus the phantom units (352) to offset the pipeline deduction. Current demand regime (P16-P23) has a mean of 188.875 units. Using L=3 (conservative), expected demand over (1+3) periods is 755.5. Adding the 352 phantom units equals 1107.5. Since In-transit (1179) exceeds this, the backend will still not order unless mu_hat is pushed higher. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory and the high demand regime to ensure the pipeline is replenished. Sigma_hat is calculated for the recent regime (last 8 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (confirmed lost orders) is 352 units (P2, P6, P15). Demand remains in a high regime (mean ~189 since P16). Lead times are highly unreliable, with a functional L=3 for planning.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the system is in a critical stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of the history reveals a significant demand regime shift starting in Period 16, with demand averaging ~190 units compared to the early average of ~100. Furthermore, three orders (P2: 143, P6: 136, P15: 73) totaling 352 units are confirmed lost, as they have exceeded any historical lead time (max observed 3 periods). These 352 units are 'phantom inventory' that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available in the pipeline. With 1179 units reported as 'In-transit', the actual available pipeline is only 827 units. To force the OR engine to order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (Current mean demand 190) * (L+1 = 4) + (Phantom inventory 352) = 1112. This ensures the base stock target is high enough to trigger new orders once the functional pipeline is subtracted. L is set to 3 to reflect the most conservative observed lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. Since Period 17, no shipments have arrived, leaving on-hand inventory at 0 for 8 consecutive periods despite a total 'In-transit' of 1179 units. Previously documented lost orders (P2, P6, P15) total 352 units. Based on the 8-period drought, orders from P17 (298 units), P18 (394 units), and P19 (135 units) are significantly delayed or likely lost, effectively making the current pipeline inventory 'phantom'. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized in a high regime (mean ~192). To force the OR engine to place a recovery order despite the large (but invisible) pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I will target a stock level that covers 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1) at the current mean (192 * 4 = 768) and add the total phantom pipeline (currently 1179 units) to offset the OR engine's subtraction of in-transit units. This results in mu_hat = 768 + 1179 = 1947. This aggressive setting is necessary to break the stockout cycle caused by the OR engine's reliance on unreliable 'In-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed: No arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods). Total 'In-transit' (1179 units) is likely entirely lost or severely delayed. Operational lead time is currently indefinite; mu_hat must be used as a manual override to force replenishment.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods of silence), despite an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,735 units. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (143), Period 6 (136), and Period 15 (73) are permanently lost. However, the subsequent orders (P17, P18, P19, P26) totaling 1,383 units are also severely overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 'In-transit' amount from its base stock calculation, and most of that pipeline is phantom or stalled, the system will not order enough units to recover unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 'In-transit' balance. Demand has stabilized in a high regime (avg ~189 since Period 16). I am setting L=3 as a planning horizon. To force an order despite the 1,735 units in-transit, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1) PLUS the in-transit amount the OR engine sees. Calculation: (4 * 189) + 1735 = 2491. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the pipeline inventory, triggering a replenishment order to account for the likelihood that existing in-transit units are lost.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals since Period 17 (9 periods). 100% of the 1,735 units 'In-transit' are either lost or indefinitely delayed. Mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset this pipeline and force replenishment.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of systemic failure with no arrivals recorded since Period 17 (11 periods ago). The In-transit value of 2,423 units consists entirely of orders that are either lost (Period 2, 6, 15) or severely delayed (Periods 17-27). Because the OR backend's logic is 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it will not place any new orders as long as the phantom 'In-transit' balance exceeds the base stock calculation (~800 units for L=3 and mean=200). To force the system to bypass this technical constraint and attempt replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I have set mu_hat to 3,400, which is calculated to exceed the current In-transit (2,423) plus the safety stock required for the current high-demand regime (~180-200 units/period). This is the only way to trigger an order when the pipeline status is effectively decoupled from actual arrivals. L=3 is maintained as the most realistic lead time given historical volatility, even though recent data suggests it might be much higher.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure persists: 11 consecutive periods without arrivals. Total 'In-transit' (2,423 units) is entirely composed of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Mu_hat must be manually set to a value > In-transit + Target Base Stock to force the OR backend to order.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blockage has partially cleared. The order from Period 26 (556 units) arrived in Period 28 (L=2), ending a 10-period drought. There are 409 units on-hand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2787 is predominantly composed of 'phantom inventory' (lost or indefinitely delayed orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). The OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 2787 in-transit and refuse to place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this phantom pipeline. Demand has slightly softened but remains in a higher regime than the start (mean ~150-160 over the last few periods). To force the backend to maintain a safety stock and order against the unreliable pipeline, I set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the phantom inventory (approx. 2500 units) plus a target base stock for a 3-period lead time (approx. 4 * 160 = 640). This results in a mu_hat of 3200.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blockage partially cleared at Period 28 (P26 order arrived, L=2). However, 2231 units of the 'In-transit' balance (orders from P17-P19 and earlier) are likely permanently lost or severely delayed, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain blockage partially cleared with arrivals from P26 (L=2) and P27 (L=2) in the last two periods, bringing on-hand inventory to 878 units. However, we have a massive 'In-transit' balance of 2103 units, the vast majority of which is 'phantom inventory' from the systemic failure between Period 17 and Period 25. Specifically, orders from P17 (298), P18 (394), and P19 (135), totaling 827 units, are now 10+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. Adding these to previously documented losses (P2: 143, P6: 136, P15: 73), the total confirmed/likely lost inventory is approximately 1,179 units. The high-demand regime (starting P16) continues with an average demand of ~185 units over the last 14 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,179 units of 'phantom' in-transit units as valid pipeline and thus stopping all orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for L=3 (most reliable lead time) and D=185 as (3+1)*185 = 740 units. Since on-hand (878) + valid pipeline (P28: 920 + P29: 4 = 924) = 1802 units, we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand mean. However, to ensure the backend doesn't completely stall if more older orders are lost, I set mu_hat to allow for the current pipeline to be processed without triggering massive new orders until the 'In-transit' figure naturally reconciles or further demand spikes occur.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered L=2 for recent orders (P26, P27). However, phantom inventory in 'In-transit' has increased to approximately 1,179 units (confirmed/likely lost: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). This creates a persistent delta of ~1200 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as incoming stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized for new orders with a lead time of 2 periods (confirmed by Period 26, 27, and 28 arrivals). However, there is a persistent 'In-transit' balance of 1,183 units that are virtually certain to be lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The OR backend includes these lost units in its pipeline inventory calculation, which prevents it from placing new orders until on-hand stock is nearly exhausted. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom inventory. Current on-hand is 1,593, which is sufficient for approximately 8 periods of demand at the current regime mean of ~190. I will keep mu_hat at 0 this period because we have excessive on-hand inventory (holding cost = $1/unit) and the OR backend's target base stock would be significantly lower than our current holdings. This allows the system to burn through the excess stock before we resume ordering once the phantom inventory 'In-transit' is no longer blocking necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized at L=2 starting Period 28. Phantom inventory (confirmed lost) remains at 1,183 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19); this total must be manually compensated for in mu_hat/sigma_hat to prevent ordering paralysis once on-hand stocks deplete.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 arriving exactly 2 periods later. The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains sustained, with recent demand (P28-P31) averaging approximately 200 units per period. Crucially, there is a persistent 'phantom inventory' problem: 1,183 units are listed as 'In-transit' but correspond to orders from Period 19 and earlier (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) which are confirmed or highly likely lost. The OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) from its calculated target. Since 'In-transit' is inflated by 1,183 units that will never arrive, the backend will refuse to order even when on-hand inventory (currently 1,366) is depleted. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as: Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory. Using L=2, mean demand=200, and a service level target (z\u22480), the required stock for (L+1) periods is 600. Adding the 1,183 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1,783. This forces the engine to see the pipeline as 'under-filled' relative to the adjusted target, ensuring replenishment continues once on-hand stock drops below the safety threshold.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilization at L=2 confirmed (P26-P28). Phantom inventory remains at 1,183 units (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime mean is stabilized at ~200 units/period since P16.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 arriving exactly 2 periods later. The demand regime starting at Period 16 remains steady with a mean of approximately 190-200 units per period. Crucially, the 'In-transit' balance of 1,183 units consists entirely of orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are severely overdue and confirmed as 'phantom inventory.' Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' value from the target base stock, it will not place new orders even as on-hand inventory depletes. To force the OR backend to order when needed, I am setting L=2 (the current reliable lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2, so 3 periods of coverage) as 3 * 200 = 600, then add the 1,183 phantom units to offset the internal subtraction, resulting in 1,783. This ensures that the engine sees the pipeline as 'empty' relative to the adjusted target. On-hand inventory is currently high (1,189), so this adjustment is a safeguard for the coming periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at an actual lead time of 2 periods (as seen in arrivals from P26, P27, and P28). Demand remains in the higher regime established since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 188 units over the last 18 periods. There is confirmed phantom inventory of 1,183 units in 'In-transit' (comprising lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19). Because On-hand (1029) + In-transit (1183) = 2212 units, the OR engine will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set to exceed this total, as it perceives the 1183 units as incoming stock. To ensure the engine begins ordering again before On-hand is depleted, mu_hat is set to 'explicit' at 1900. This value accounts for the desired pipeline (approx (1+2)*190 = 570) plus the 1183 phantom units, forcing the OR backend to recognize the need for replenishment. Sigma_hat is set using N=18 to capture the volatility of the current demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-591.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (L=2) for recent orders, while demand remains in a high regime (mean ~200 since Period 16). However, there is a significant 'phantom' inventory issue: approximately 1,183 units are listed as 'In-transit' from historical orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19) that are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Currently, on-hand (810) + in-transit (1,183) = 1,993. If target base_stock is ~600-800, the engine will never place new orders until on-hand falls enough to counteract the phantom 1,183. To force the engine to order when needed, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' to include a buffer that offsets this phantom inventory. With on-hand at 810 and daily demand at ~200, we have ~4 periods of stock. I will set mu_hat to 1,783 (calculated as [1+2] * 200 + 1183 phantom) to ensure the backend recognizes a need to order as on-hand depletes further, though we currently have a surplus, we must prevent the gap from widening into a stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Supply chain L=2 confirmed. Phantom inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) remains at 1,183 units and must be manually offset in mu_hat to prevent ordering paralysis.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of L=2 (confirmed by arrivals in P28, P29, and P30). Demand has maintained a higher regime since P16, with a mean of approximately 190 units (P16-P35 avg = 189.5). There is a persistent issue with 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: 1,183 units are listed as 'In-transit' but correspond to orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 that are confirmed or effectively lost. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts all in-transit inventory from the target base stock. Since 1,183 units will never arrive, the backend will refuse to order once on-hand inventory (currently 589) falls below the base stock minus 1,183. To prevent this ordering paralysis and ensure continuity as on-hand stock depletes, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at ~190 units/period (~570 units) and then add the 1,183 phantom units to this total. This forces the OR engine to see a 'requirement' that offsets the lost pipeline, effectively ignoring the 1,183 units and ordering based on real stock needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=20 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at a lead time of 2 periods (L=2) based on recent arrivals (P26-P28). Demand has remained in a higher regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 190.2 units/period (average P16-P36). Total on-hand inventory is 377 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,183 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock to determine the order quantity, these 1,183 'phantom' units will prevent any new orders from being placed until on-hand stock is nearly exhausted, causing stockouts. To bypass this, mu_hat must be manually set to a value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (L+1) * Mean + Safety Stock. With L=2, Mean=190, and a high service level requirement (profit=cost=1.0), safety stock is roughly 1.645 * sigma. Calculated mu_hat value: (3 * 190) + 1183 = 1753. This ensures the engine places an order to maintain the physical pipeline despite the recorded (but non-existent) in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 190-200 units (average P30-P37: 200.3 units). The supply chain has settled back to L=2 (confirmed by P26-P28 arrivals), but we are carrying a massive amount of 'phantom inventory' in the in-transit balance. Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 1,183 units) are over 18 periods old and are clearly lost. The current in-transit listed is 1,376 units, meaning only approximately 193 units (from P37) are actually live. The OR backend subtracts the full 1,376 from the target base stock, which would lead to a zero-order recommendation if not corrected. Since we have 195 units on hand and 193 live units in-transit, we have 388 units of 'real' pipeline. With a target base stock for a (2+1)=3 period window (3 * 200 = 600 units), we need to order. To force this, mu_hat is set to 'explicit' at 1,783 units. This value is calculated as: (Target Base Stock of 600) + (Phantom Inventory of 1,183). By providing this inflated mu_hat, the backend's formula (base_stock - in_transit) becomes ((600 + 1183) - 1376 - 195), which correctly triggers a replenishment order for the high-demand regime while accounting for the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory reconciliation: 1,183 units of In-transit inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost. Mu_hat must include a +1,183 unit offset to prevent ordering paralysis until the pipeline is cleared.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a major 'phantom inventory' issue. There are 1,183 units in the 'In-transit' bucket representing confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from its target base stock, it calculates that no new orders are needed, even as on-hand inventory has hit zero. To force the engine to place orders, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset these 1,183 lost units. In Period 38, we were stocked out (0 ending inventory). Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16 (mean ~195). For Period 39, setting mu_hat = (1+L)*mean + lost_stock = (1+2)*195 + 1183 \u2248 1768. This ensures the engine sees the true need for inventory. L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P26-P28) confirmed the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of approximately 1-2 periods (as seen with recent arrivals from P38 arriving in P39). However, a significant 'phantom inventory' issue persists: 1,183 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the target base stock, it will not order again until on-hand levels are critically low or negative. To counteract this, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to include a 'phantom offset'. Current demand (P16-P39) has stabilized at a high regime with a mean of ~196 units/period. For Period 40, target base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) at a 50% service level (Profit=Holding=$1) is ~196 * 3 = 588 units. To force an order when In-transit is 1556 (containing 1183 phantom units), mu_hat must be set to approximately (Target Base Stock + Phantom Units) = 588 + 1183 = 1771. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the current high-demand regime (~35) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of approximately 1-2 periods (Period 38 order arrived in 1 period, Period 39 order arrived in 1 period). However, there is a significant 'phantom inventory' issue: 1,183 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 1591 units. The OR backend uses (Inventory + In-transit) to determine order quantities. With 1,183 phantom units, the engine thinks we have plenty of stock, leading to ordering paralysis. To counter this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to include a 'phantom offset'. Current demand regime (from P16 onwards) shows a mean of ~195 units. Target base stock for L=2 should be around 3 * 195 = 585 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory), we force the OR engine to place an order that covers actual demand while ignoring the stuck pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 1800 (approx 600 + 1200) to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order of ~200 units per period as on-hand is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time for recent periods (P38-P40) is 1 period. Total phantom inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) confirmed at 1,183 units; this remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation to bypass ordering paralysis.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a mean of approximately 201 units/period (recent_N=25: 197). The primary challenge is the ordering paralysis caused by the OR backend counting 'In-transit' inventory that is actually lost. Total confirmed lost units (phantom inventory) from periods P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 remain at 1,183 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline shows 1,800 units. To bypass this, mu_hat must be manually inflated. The current lead time (L) has stabilized at 1 period for recent orders (P38-P39). Target base stock for L=1 and mean=201 is approx 400. Adding the 1,183 phantom units to this target yields a mu_hat of 1,583. However, with 1,800 currently in-transit, setting mu_hat below 1,800 would result in zero units ordered. To force a replenishment order of approximately 200 units (matching current demand), mu_hat must be set to (In-transit + Target) \u2248 1,800 + 400 = 2,200. This ensures the backend calculates an order despite the phantom stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show recent lead time stability (L=1 for P38 and P39 orders), though P41 and P42 orders have not yet arrived. The most critical issue remains the 1,183 units of phantom inventory (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that still show as 'In-transit'. This misleading data prevents the OR backend from ordering because it perceives a massive pipeline surplus. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized in a high regime with a mean of approximately 195 units per period. To force orders and replenish stock, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: Target Base Stock (for L=1, R=1, it is roughly (1+1)*195 = 390 units) + the Phantom Inventory (1,183 units) = ~1573. I will set mu_hat to 1600 to ensure the backend places an order that covers immediate demand and overcomes the negative bias of the lost shipments. L is set to explicit 1 based on most recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized at L=1 for orders placed P38-P39. Phantom inventory (confirmed lost) remains at 1,183 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), requiring sustained manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show instability. While Period 41-42 saw zero arrivals, Period 43 finally saw the arrival of the Period 40 order, but with a lead time of 3 periods, contradicting the recent L=1 trend. This indicates that L=3 is the safer planning horizon. Demand remains stable in the high regime (mean ~200). Most critically, 'In-transit' inventory stands at 1985 units, but 1256 units of this are confirmed/highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P41 is overdue relative to L=1). These lost units create a massive 'phantom inventory' that prevents the OR engine from ordering. To trigger a replenishment order of approximately 400 units (2 periods of demand plus safety stock), mu_hat must be set to exceed 'In-transit' plus target stock. I set mu_hat explicitly to 2400 (Phantom 1256 + 2 periods demand 400 + Cushion) to force the backend to place an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Lead time increased back to 3 periods (P40 arrived P43). Total phantom inventory (lost orders) updated to 1256 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P41 is now overdue). mu_hat must be manually inflated significantly above 'In-transit' levels to bypass ordering paralysis.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present significant challenges with phantom inventory and unstable lead times. Recent arrivals from Periods 40 and 41 confirm a lead time of 3 periods (P40 arrived P43, P41 arrived P44). This shift from the recent L=1 streak suggests we must use a conservative L=3. Total 'In-transit' is 2191 units, but a large portion consists of historical lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 1183 units. Additionally, the order from P42 (400 units) is still in its lead-time window. The demand regime remains stable in the high range, with a mean of approximately 196 units over the last 10 periods (P35-P44). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1183 phantom units as viable stock and stopping orders, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Formula: (Demand Forecast * (L + 1)) + Phantom Inventory. With a forecast of 200, L=3, and 1183 phantom units, the target is (200 * 4) + 1183 = 1983. This ensures the engine accounts for the real pipeline while bypassing the paralyzed stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as unstable, reverting to 3 periods (P41 arrived P44). Total confirmed phantom inventory remains at 1183 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), necessitating manual mu_hat inflation to avoid stockouts.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit a lead time of 3 periods (confirmed by P40-P42 arrivals). Demand remains stable in the high regime (mean ~198 since Period 16). The critical issue is the 'In-transit' balance of 1,791 units, which includes 1,183 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The OR engine's capped policy subtracts this 1,791 from the base stock. To prevent ordering paralysis and ensure replenishment for the 200/period demand, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to 2300. This value is derived by taking the target pipeline (200 units/period * 4 periods = 800) and adding the 1,183 phantom units, then rounding up to ensure a safety buffer is maintained above the perceived in-transit total. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit and place an order.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high lead-time volatility, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most consistent conservative estimate for planning. The primary challenge is the significant volume of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders) totaling 1,183 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) plus P37's shipment (193 units) which is now 9 periods old and clearly lost. Total confirmed/highly likely lost inventory is 1,376 units. Current 'In-transit' is 2,087 units, meaning only 711 units (orders from P44, P46) are physically expected. Demand is stable in the high regime (approx. 200 units/period). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 2,087 units in the pipeline and refusing to order (ordering paralysis), mu_hat must be manually inflated to cover the expected demand plus the phantom inventory balance. Setting mu_hat to 2,200 (approx. 4 periods of demand @ 200 + 1,400 phantom units) ensures the engine triggers an order to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders) updated to 1,376 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P37). The OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation is inflated by this amount, necessitated continued manual mu_hat overrides.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 2,200 units. Based on historical tracking, a significant portion of this 'In-transit' figure is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were confirmed lost or are indefinitely delayed. As of Period 47, we identified 1,376 units as phantom (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). The OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (2,200) from the target base stock to determine new orders. Since 2,200 is much higher than any reasonable 3-4 period demand forecast (~800 units), the backend will order 0 units unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed the phantom level. Demand has stabilized in a high regime since P16, with a recent 10-period mean around 205 units. Lead time is volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 for conservative planning. To trigger a replenishment order of approximately 200-300 units (intended for P51/P52 given the game ends at P50), I set mu_hat explicitly to 2,500 units (In-transit 2,200 + Target buffer 300).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from significant reliability issues, with a confirmed total of 1,376 units in 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). The current 'In-transit' balance of 2,500 units is heavily inflated by these losses. The actual recent lead time has reverted to 3 periods (P40, 41, and 42 arrived/scheduled around that window). At Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0. To trigger any order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the current perceived pipeline (2,500 units) plus the required base stock. Since the game is near completion (Period 49 of 50), the goal is to secure one final shipment to cover the last period. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,300 to bypass the 2,500-unit pipeline hurdle and ensure a replenishment order is emitted despite the large 'phantom' in-transit balance.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability and phantom inventory issues. As of Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and 'In-transit' is 3,300 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this in-transit balance (approximately 1,376 units) consists of confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P37). Recent lead times have reverted to 3 periods (P40, P41, P42 all took 3 periods). Demand has stabilized in a high-regime range with a mean of ~200 units since Period 16. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 3,300 in-transit units as viable stock and refusing to order, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the current perceived pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 4,500 (target pipeline 1,200 + 3,300 phantom/congested offset) to force a replenishment order that ensures continuity as the older lost orders never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply chain lead time remains unstable at L=3. Total confirmed/likely phantom inventory (lost orders) remains at ~1,376 units, causing persistent OR engine ordering paralysis. Manual mu_hat inflation is required to maintain stock levels.
