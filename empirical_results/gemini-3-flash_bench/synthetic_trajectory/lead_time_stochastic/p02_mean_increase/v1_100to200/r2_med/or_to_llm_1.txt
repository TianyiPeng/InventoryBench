The promised lead-time is 2. This suggests variability, but the average is close to 2. The Period 2 order (151 units) is still in-transit and is expected to arrive in Period 5 (it has been 3 periods since the order). 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are 126, 83, 70, 105, and 89 (average ~95). Demand appears relatively stable but with some variance. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 91. Pipeline includes the Period 2 order of 151 units. Total system inventory (Position) is 242. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 93 units. However, my current total inventory (242) already covers approximately 2.5 periods of demand (242 / 95 = 2.54). Given the lead-time of 2 periods, the standard (L+1) target is 3 periods of demand (~285 units). 5. Adjustment: The Period 2 order of 151 units is essentially filling the pipeline. If I order the OR recommendation of 93, my total inventory position becomes 335, which covers 3.5 periods of demand. This is slightly high given the holding cost of $1/unit vs $4 profit.

Crucially, the P2 order (151 units) and the P6 order (92 units) have not arrived; P2 is now 7 periods old and almost certainly lost, while P6 is 3 periods old (overdue if L=2). Inventory status: On-hand is 36. In-transit consists of P6 (92), P8 (95), and the current potential order. Since P6 might be lost and P8 is not due until P11 (if L=3) or P10 (if L=1/2), we face a high stockout risk for Period 9 demand (est ~100). The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the assumption that the 338 units in transit (including the possibly lost P2 and P6) will satisfy demand. Adjusting for reality: If we remove the lost P2 (151) and possibly lost P6 (92) from the pipeline, the effective in-transit is only P8 (95). With 36 on hand and a need to cover at least 2 periods (P9 and P10) at ~100 units/period, we need ~200 units. Current reliable inventory (36 on-hand + 95 in-transit) = 131 units.

There is a pattern of alternating lead times or split shipments, but the consistent observation is that orders from P2 (ordered 151) and P6 (ordered 92) have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2.

My 'Carry-Over Insights' confirm that 1,193 units (orders from P19 and earlier) are effectively lost 'ghost' inventory. The total reported in-transit is 1,543. Subtracting the ghost units (1,193) leaves a reliable pipeline of only 350 units (orders from P28 and P29). \n2. Demand Analysis: The SKU has transitioned to a high-demand regime since P18, with an average of approximately 195 units per period. Recent periods (P25-P29) show spikes as high as 239. \n3. Inventory Position: Ending inventory for P29 is 0. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, I must cover demand for the next 3-4 periods (P30, P31, P32, and P33) to prevent stockouts, given current 0 on-hand inventory. Required stock for 4 periods at 195/period is ~780 units. \n4. Adjustment: The reliable pipeline is 350 units. Therefore, 780 - 350 = 430 units needed. The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the massive 'ghost' in-transit inventory (1,543 units) as valid, suggesting we are overstocked. I am overriding this to 190 units (maintaining our consistent order pace) to ensure a steady inflow while monitoring if P28/P29 orders arrive as expected.

The OR recommendation is 0, which is logically flawed because it counts 'ghost' pipeline inventory as available stock. The total in-transit is 2,153, but my longitudinal tracking confirms that 1,563 units are lost/overdue (all orders P25 and earlier).

Specifically, P37 and P38 orders are accounted for, meaning the reliable in-transit consists of P39's order (210) and potentially late-arriving fragments. With demand at ~285 and lead time oscillating between 1-3 periods, a base stock level calculation for (L+1) periods (3+1=4) requires approximately 1,140 units. Current effective inventory is 0 on-hand + 210 in-transit = 210. I need to order significantly to bridge this gap and account for the high loss rate.

Regarding inventory, the current 'In-transit' figure of 2693 units is highly misleading. Per the carry-over insights, 1,933 units are confirmed lost (shipments from P25 and earlier). Analysis of more recent orders shows that P41 (260 units) and P42 (280 units) are currently in-transit within a reliable lead-time window (1-3 periods). P40 (210 units) appears missing since it hasn't arrived by P42 conclude despite recent lead times being 1-2 periods. This suggests a continued ~30-50% loss rate. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory. The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored as it likely perceives the massive 'ghost' pipeline as sufficient stock. To maintain a safety stock covering ~2 periods of demand (approx 500 units) and accounting for high delivery failure, a substantial order is required.

The supply chain remains highly unreliable; historical analysis confirms 2,143 units of the total 2,763 in-transit units are lost or severely overdue (all orders from P25 and earlier, plus the likely lost P40 order). This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of only 620 units (orders from P41, P42, and P43). The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically flawed because it counts the ~2,143 lost units as available inventory.

In-transit is listed as 2783 units, but my 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 2,143 of these units (orders from P25 and earlier, and potentially P40) are lost or severely overdue. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists of orders from P42 (280 units), P43 (280 units), and P44 (280 units). The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on the 'ghost' inventory of 2783 units; however, when excluding the 2143 lost units, the reliable pipeline is 840 units. Given a lead time of 1-3 periods (averaging 2), we need to cover demand for Period 45, 46, and 47 (approx 660 total units). While the current reliable pipeline (840) theoretically covers this, the historical loss rate (~30-50%) and the need to maintain a buffer for the current high-demand regime suggest we should continue ordering to prevent upcoming stockouts.

Removing the ghost inventory (2,143 lost units) leaves a reliable pipeline of only 360 units (remaining portions of orders from P44 and P45). \n\n2. Demand Analysis: Demand has transitioned through several regimes, currently stabilizing around a mean of ~210-250 units. Recent periods show: P45 (194), P44 (241), P43 (167), P42 (175), P41 (164). While the OR baseline calculates based on all history, the recent 5-period average is ~188, significantly lower than the P37-P40 spike (~250+). However, to maintain safety against the confirmed high arrival loss rates, we must rely on recent sustained averages.\n\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 428 units. Reliable Pipeline is 360 units. Total Reliable Position = 788 units. \n\n4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 units because it likely sees the massive (but false) 'In-transit' 2,503 units.

With 65 on-hand and 1,050 in the reliable pipeline (Orders P44, P45, P47 totaling 280+280+280+210 = 1050), we have ~1115 units to cover Periods 48, 49, and 50. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~690 (using avg ~230). While it looks like we have enough, the delivery reliability is poor (~30-50% loss rate).
