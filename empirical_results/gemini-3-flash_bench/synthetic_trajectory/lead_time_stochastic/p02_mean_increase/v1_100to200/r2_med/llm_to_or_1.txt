Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no prior history. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 shows an average of 101.8 units/period. For the first decision, I will set L to the promised 2 periods (total coverage 1+L=3 periods). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), I want to ensure a high service level. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the average of the 5 historical samples provided [141, 118, 67, 94, 89], which is 101.8. Total mu_hat = (1+2)*101.8 = 305.4. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of these 5 samples is approximately 28.5. Total sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*28.5 = 49.36.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 149 units, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 126 units of lost demand from Period 1. The historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) for 'chips(Regular)' show a mean of approximately 101.8. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the base stock calculation needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L to stick to the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a baseline. The OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*101.8 = 305.4 and sigma_hat accordingly. This will help the system place an order to cover the pipeline gap and prepare for future demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1-3 was 141 (actual 126), 118 (actual 83), and 67. The system started with 0 inventory. Orders were placed in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (151 units), totaling 300 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the Period 1 order (placed in Period 1's decision phase) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision). This follows the timing: P1 Decision -> P1 Order; P3 Arrival Resolution -> P1 Order arrives. We should see confirmation of this arrival in the Period 3 conclusion (at the start of Period 4). Therefore, current on-hand is still 0 because no arrivals have concluded yet. Demand has been lower than the initial estimates (126 vs 141, 83 vs 118). I will use the recent mean of the first 5 samples provided in the background (avg: 101.8) to set parameters for the 3-period window (L+1). L is set to default (2).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are currently in transit (totaling 300 units). Based on the 2-period lead time, we expect the Period 1 order (149 units) to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state, but the Period 3 conclude report (viewed now at P4 start) shows 0 arrived. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (P1 order arrives in P4, visible in P5) or there is a delay. Following the 'Critical Timing Example', an order placed in N with L=2 arrives during N+2 and is confirmed at N+3. Thus, P1 order (placed P1) should have been confirmed in P3 conclude (read at P4). Since it wasn't, the shipment is either delayed or the lead time is >= 3. I will adjust L to 3 to cover this delay. Demand mean (P1-P3) is ~93. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period (averaging to 2). We are currently in Period 5 and just saw Period 4 conclude. Demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) show a mean of ~102. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the average of observed lead times (2.0). Since demand has been relatively consistent with no clear regime shift yet, I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all 5 samples, which provides a more stable estimate than a small 'recent_N'. The in-transit inventory is quite high (266) relative to average demand, so the OR backend's base-stock logic will likely moderate new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (Periods 1-5: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89; mean ~102) shows significant variability. Lead time analysis: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), while Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 (151 units) is currently late (placed P2, promised P4, currently start of P6). Due to the stockout in Period 5 and the unpredictability of lead times (averaging 2 but ranging 1-3), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon (+1 for current period demand). For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples average 101.8. To protect against stockouts given the recent zero inventory, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full recent history. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history: Period 1 order (149 units) arrived at Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 3 order (7 units) also arrived at Period 4 (lead time = 1). The average lead time observed is 2 periods, matching the promised lead time, but with significant variability. Current inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts (P5, P6) due to small orders and delayed arrivals. The pipeline (in-transit) is 432 units, covering orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6. Average demand over 6 periods is ~94.3. Given the stockouts and the need to stabilize, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand and sigma to capture the full recent history while recovering from the stockout. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the variance observed (1 vs 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 7 periods is: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67. The mean demand is approximately 90.4 units/period. Lead time analysis: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1), Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (L=3). The average lead time observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations suggest instability or a trend toward L=3. Period 2's order (151 units) is currently missing (now 6 periods since ordering, L=2+4), suggesting it may be lost. In-transit inventory excluding the likely lost P2 order is 317 - 151 = 166 units (from P5 and P6). With on-hand at 48 and expected demand of ~90, we are at risk of stockout if arrivals don't occur. I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the observed delays and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent slight softening in demand (averaging 84.8 over the last 5 periods) vs the early spike. The OR engine will target a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times are volatile (range 1-3, avg 2.33). Period 2 order (151 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $614.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 14 units. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean of ~100 units (avg of last 8 periods is 98.75). The lead time behavior is the primary concern: while the promised lead time is 2, observed actual lead times are 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods. The order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost. My current pipeline (203 units) consists of orders from P6 (43 units), P8 (9 units), and the order placed this period. To provide a buffer against the high variability and the trend of actual lead times being 3 periods, I will set L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the baseline demand profile since the start. This setting ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand, compensating for the high stockout risk seen in periods 5 and 6.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend sustained at 3 periods (3 out of 4 successful deliveries). Order from Period 2 (151 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The observed lead times have settled into a pattern where most 'long' shipments take 3 periods (Period 1, 4, and 5 orders all took 3 periods), while short-distance/emergency style orders from the OR backend occasionally arrive in 1 period (Period 3 and 8 orders). The order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is officially treated as a lost shipment to avoid under-ordering. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 345 in-transit (orders from P6, P8, P9). Demand has shown a slight uptick recently, with the mean of the last 5 samples being 102.2 units. Given the actual lead time of 3 periods is dominant for regular stock replenishment, I am setting L=3 to ensure the (L+1) planning horizon (4 periods) is properly covered. Utilizing N=5 for demand and volatility captures the recent trend while smoothing out the volatility of individual periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of concluded periods shows a significant deviation from the promised lead time (2 periods). Excluding the likely lost shipment from Period 2 (now overdue by 9 periods), successful deliveries have occurred at L=3 (P1, P4, P5) and L=1 (P3, P8). The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods, but the more recent trend and higher frequency favor L=3 to ensure availability. Historical demand is relatively stable, with an average of approximately 99 units per period. Since on-hand is zero and we have a high pipeline (471 units), the OR backend needs to account for the longer lead time (L=3) to set a sufficient base stock (covering L+1=4 periods of demand). I will use explicit values to account for the lost shipment's impact on pipeline math and ensure the system targets a base stock around 400-450 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend stabilizes at 3 periods (3 out of 5 successful deliveries). Period 2 order (151 units) is definitively lost after 9 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). Comparing the promised lead time (2) with historical arrivals (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1), the actual lead time is frequently 3 periods. Specifically, orders from P4, P5, and P8 arrived after 3, 3, and 1 periods respectively. The average of the successful arrivals is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2. However, the mode is 3. The shipment from P2 (151 units) is now 10 periods overdue and is definitively lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 471 units (orders from P6, P9, P10). P6 is 6 periods overdue and likely lost as well. To compensate for the 'lost' pipeline units and the observed lead time extension to 3 periods, I will set L to 3. Demand over the last 11 periods is fairly stable, with an average of approximately 98 units per period. I'll use recent_N (N=8) to capture this moderate demand regime more accurately than the full sample mean, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline loss confirmed: Order from Period 6 (43 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed). Actual lead time remains unstable but frequently trends toward 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the chip inventory is at 193 units on-hand. Examining shipping history: Period 1 (L=3), Period 3 (L=1), Period 4 (L=3), Period 5 (L=3), Period 8 (L=1), Period 9 (L=3), and Period 10 (L=2). The mode is 3, and the average of the last 5 successful arrivals is 2.4. I will use L=3 to be safe given the volatility. Regarding lost shipments: Period 2 (151 units) is now 11 periods overdue and Period 6 (43 units) is 7 periods overdue; both are definitively lost. The In-transit total of 194 is likely purely ghost inventory from these losses, as no recent orders are pending. Demand across the last 12 periods has been relatively stable around 90-100 units. I will use method 'recent_N' with N=12 for demand to capture the full recent history (average ~99). Setting L to 3 (explicit) ensures the OR engine calculation (1+L) covers 4 periods of demand, which is necessary to replenish the pipeline effectively since the current 'In-transit' probably contains 0 viable units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline loss verified: Period 2 order (151 units) and Period 6 order (43 units) are lost. Lead time average is 2.4, but mode is 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 149 units. Demand over the last 13 periods has averaged approximately 92.5 units per period. The carry-over insights and history confirm that the orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units) are lost. Consequently, the effective in-transit inventory is 239 - 151 - 43 = 45 units (from the Period 13 order). Actual lead times have stabilized at a mode of 3 periods, although the 'promised' lead time is 2. To account for this, I am setting L to 3. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (P9-P13) is 83.8 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this slightly lower recent demand trend. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across the recent regime to ensure a sufficient safety stock given the lead time volatility and lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (4 units) after a demand of 145 in Period 14. History analysis confirms two lost orders: Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units), meaning the current 'In-transit' of 239 represents only one valid order (Period 13 for 45 units) plus recent systemic signals. Effective lead time (L) has a mode and recent trend of 3 periods (Periods 1, 4, 5, 9 all arrived with lead_time=3). I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended pipeline required to cover demand. Demand across the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14) shows a mean of 91.4; however, the long-term mean (Periods 1-14) is 97.4. Given the stockout risk and the recent period's high demand (145), I will use the last 14 samples to maintain a robust buffer, setting mu_hat for (1+L)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic lead time reliably identified as 3 periods (4 of the last 6 successful deliveries). Valid pipeline verified: Period 13 order (45 units) is the only active shipment expected from orders made before P15, excluding confirmed losses from P2 and P6.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 387 units in-transit. However, historical analysis confirmed that orders from P2 (151 units) and P6 (43 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 193 units (from P13 and P15). Specifically, the P13 order (45 units) is expected to arrive in P16 (based on L=3), and the P15 order (148 units) is expected in P18. The current demand mean over the last 15 periods is ~101 units. Given the actual lead time (L) consistently trends toward 3, the target base stock must cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, approximately 404 units. With an effective pipeline of 193 units and 0 on-hand, we need to order approximately 211 units. To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover the 4-period window while accounting for the 'phantom' inventory in its records (the lost 194 units), I will set L to 3 and provide an explicit mu_hat that targets the 404-unit requirement plus the 194-unit discrepancy, totaling ~598 units. This compensates for the backend's ignorance of the lost shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 with 0 units on-hand and 185 units of lost demand in Period 16. My carry-over insights confirm that orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units) are lost. Therefore, the pipeline inventory of 547 units includes 194 units of lost shipments (151 + 43), leaving a true effective pipeline of 353 units (Orders from P15 and P16). Lead time analysis from the history shows that out of 9 successful deliveries, 5 had a lead time of 3 periods, 1 had 2 periods, and 2 had 1 period. Given the recent consistency of 3-period arrivals (P13 arrived in P16), I will continue using an explicit L=3. Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has shown a significant upward trend (145, 155, 185), with a mean of 122.6. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent increase while acknowledging the volatility. Setting L to 3 (explicit) ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand, which is necessary given the observed arrivals and current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $605.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the 205 units ordered in Period 16 arrived in just 1 period (actual lead time), resulting in 43 units on-hand. However, lead times for this SKU are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 382 includes several units: the order from Period 15 (148 units, now 3 periods out), the order from Period 17 (40 units, just placed), and the definitively lost units from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units). 151 + 43 = 194 units are lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 382 - 194 = 188 units. There is a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 14: mean demand has increased from ~95 to ~160 (+68%). I am setting L to 3 to protect against the frequent longer lead times and using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 14: average demand increased from ~95 to ~160 per period. Lead time remains volatile but frequently stabilizes at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a demand spike in Period 18 (205 units). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (starting Period 14) is confirmed: the average demand of the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 170 units (145, 155, 185, 162, 205), significantly higher than the initial average of ~95. The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. Our current pipeline (In-transit: 602) includes orders from P15 (148 units), P17 (40 units), and P18 (220 units), along with confirmed lost orders from P2 (151 units) and P6 (43 units). Adjusting for these losses (194 units), the effective pipeline is 408 units. Using L=3 to account for the frequent longer lead times and recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime, we aim to rebuild stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the OR backend manages the pipeline/holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~170 (+79%). Effective pipeline inventory should exclude lost orders from Period 2 (151) and Period 6 (43).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14, increasing from approximately 95 units per period to approximately 175 units per period (Average P14-P19: 175.8). I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher demand average accurately. Lead times remain volatile (P13 arrived in 3 periods, P16 in 1), but the modal lead time is 3 periods. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the likely 3-period lead time plus the current review period. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the increased volatility in the new demand regime. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 723, but this includes confirmed lost orders from P2 (151 units) and P6 (43 units). Net active pipeline is 529 (Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19). Providing L=3, mu_hat (1+3)*175.8, and increased sigma should trigger an order to replenish the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~175 units (+84%). Sigma also increased in this regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14, increasing from approximately 95 units/period to an average of 175 units over the last 7 periods (P14-P20). Period 21 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 747 units. Crucially, 194 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving an effective pipeline of 553 units. The lead time remains volatile but averages approximately 2.6 periods (mode of 3). I set L explicitly to 3 to account for this volatility and ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle. For mu_hat, I use N=7 to capture only the high-demand regime since Period 14. Sigma_hat is also set using N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this new regime, which helps maintain a sufficient safety stock and prevents stockouts during arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized at mean ~175 (+84% vs prior), with significantly higher variance. Effective pipeline excludes 194 lost units (P2: 151, P6: 43).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14, with the mean demand increasing from ~95 to ~175. The last few periods (P18-P21) show even higher demand (avg ~211), suggesting the shift may still be evolving or experiencing high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and internal lead times are averaging 3 periods despite the promised 2. I have two confirmed lost orders (P2: 151 units, P6: 43 units, Total: 194) which are still counted in the backend's 'in-transit' logic; hence, my mu_hat needs to be set explicitly high to force the OR backend's base stock calculation higher to overcome this ghost inventory. Setting L=3 reflects the actual observed lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 190 = 760, and sigma_hat is adjusted to capture the increased volatility since Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 18, with the last 4 periods averaging 211 units, exceeding the already elevated P14 regime mean of 175. Actual lead time remains anchored at 3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 14, and there has been a secondary surge since Period 18. Average demand over the last 5 periods is 205.8 units, significantly higher than the Period 14-17 average of ~162. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 18-22) to capture this latest intensity. Lead time remains highly volatile, but the mode and most frequent observation for successful deliveries is 3 periods; I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure sufficient pipeline coverage. The 'In-transit' quantity of 815 includes 194 units from periods 2 and 6 that are definitively lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 621 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts since Period 18, the parameters need to aggressively drive orders until the pipeline resolves.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift (P18-P22) shows a mean increase to ~206 units per period. Effective pipeline excludes 194 lost units from P2 and P6.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 14 and intensified further at Period 18. Current demand (last 6 periods) averages ~202 units per period, significantly higher than the initial average of ~95. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 771 units includes 194 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost;\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3063\u3066, the effective pipeline is 577 units. Recent arrivals (orders from P20, P21, P22) arrived in Period 23, showing lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, maintaining the observed volatility, but we stick to an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the risk of longer transit times in the base stock calculation (covering L+1 periods of demand). For mu_hat, I use N=6 (Period 18-23) to capture the most recent intensified demand level (~202 units/period). For sigma_hat, I use the same window to reflect increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime intensification confirmed: Since Period 18, mean demand has increased to ~202 units (+15% vs P14 shift, +113% vs baseline).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has intensified, with a mean demand of approximately 202 units per period. Additionally, we are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand = 0), and demand variability (sigma) has increased alongside the mean. The actual lead time remains volatile but is frequently 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 847 units includes 194 units from systemic early-game losses (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 43 units) which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 653 units. Given the lead time is likely 3, using L=3 (requiring inventory for 4 periods of demand) and setting mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P18-P24) will help the OR backend correctly calibrate the base stock level for this higher demand regime while accounting for the lost pipeline capital.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-24 stable at mean ~202 (+113% vs baseline). Effective pipeline excludes 194 lost units (P2: 151, P6: 43).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is currently stock-out (on-hand = 0). Demand analysis confirms a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 18, with the last 8 samples (P18-P25) averaging 200.5 units per period. Prior regimes (P14-P17) and the baseline (P1-P13) are no longer representative. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; using L=3 is necessary for protection given recent arrivals and historical performance. The pipeline inventory (799 units) is significantly inflated by 194 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 151 units, P6: 43 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 605 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current 200+ unit demand level and set L to 'explicit' at 3 periods to account for the observed maximum lead time and provide a safety buffer against the high stock-out risk seen in the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-25 remains stable at mean ~201 (+112% vs baseline). Lost orders (151 from P2, 43 from P6) continue to distort the reported pipeline inventory; effective pipeline is (In-transit - 194).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has established a mean around 201 units, though variance has increased. The reported In-transit inventory of 842 units is misleading due to 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units). The effective pipeline inventory is 842 - 194 = 648 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead times remain volatile but average approximately 3 periods (calculated by the backend). For Period 27, I will use recent trends to set demand parameters: N=9 for mu_hat covers the current high-demand regime since Period 18. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to capture the elevated volatility observed in this period. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to use the historical average lead time (which trends toward 2.4-3.0), but the base_stock calculation (1+L) will properly account for the units needed to cover the lead time and the review period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0. The demand remains in the high-demand regime that began around Period 18, with the most recent periods showing high volatility and sustained demand levels (~200 units/period). The reported in-transit inventory of 842 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units), totaling 194 units. The effective pipeline is thus 648 units. However, recent arrivals (P23, P25) suggest a lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with an average closer to 2-3. Since actual arrivals have been sparse and demand is outstripping supply (ending on-hand 0 for several periods), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated demand regime from P18-P27, and use 'explicit' lead time L=3 to ensure a robust base stock that accounts for the frequent 3-period delays and provides a buffer against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory is (Reported In-transit - 194) due to confirmed lost orders from P2 and P6. Recent demand (P18-P27) remains stable at a mean of approximately 198 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18-28) is stable with a mean of approximately 198 units per period and a standard deviation of about 26 units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this specific regime. The lead time (L) remains volatile but averages around 2.2-2.3 periods (calculated L on all arrivals is ~2.3); I will use the 'calculate' method to allow the system to use the full historical context of lead times. A critical factor is the persistent reporting of lost orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units) in the 'In-transit' figure. Total lost units = 194. True pipeline inventory is (799 - 194) = 605 units. With on-hand inventory at 0, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would normally be based on seeing 799 units in-transit. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for this discrepancy [e.g., target base stock + phantom units], I can force a correct order. Current target base stock for (L=3 terms) is approx 4 * 198 = 792. With 605 actual units in transit, we need an order of ~187. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at (1+L)*198 + 194 to offset the backend's deduction of the lost 194 units.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P18-P28) stable at mean 198. Effective in-transit inventory remains (Reported In-transit - 194) due to confirmed lost orders from P2 (151) and P6 (43).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18-29) is stable with a mean of approximately 198 units per period and a high standard deviation. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Reported in-transit is 899, but this includes 194 units from legendary lost orders in Period 2 (151) and Period 6 (43), which have not arrived for over 20 periods. Thus, the effective pipeline is 705 units. Lead times remain volatile but average around 2.4-3 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the lead time mode and potential delays. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=12 to capture the elevated regime since Period 18 (Mean ~198). This results in a mu_hat of approx 792 ((1+3)*198). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=12 to reflect the high volatility in this regime, providing sufficient safety stock to handle demand spikes.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a sustained high-demand regime since Period 18 and significant inventory depletion. The mean demand from Period 18 to Period 30 has stabilized at approximately 199.5 units per period. Lead times continue to be volatile but center around 3 periods. A critical factor is the persistent discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: 194 units (151 from Period 2 and 43 from Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To correct for this and prevent the system from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Using a lead time (L) of 3, the backend looks at (L+1) or 4 periods of demand. With a target demand of 200 units/period, the real requirement is 800 units. However, I must inflate mu_hat by the 194 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ignoring those phantom units in the pipeline calculation (800 + 194 = 994). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the P18-P30 regime) to capture higher current volatility (std dev approx 30 units, scaled for L=3).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P18-P30) confirmed with mean ~200 units (+115% vs baseline).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and increased volatility. For Period 32, I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering periods 18-31) to capture this regime accurately. The lead time remains volatile but averages around 2-3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a buffer against stockouts, especially given the current zero on-hand inventory. The reported in-transit inventory of 1038 units includes 194 units from confirmed lost orders (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 43 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 844 units. By setting L to 3 and using the high-demand mean, the OR backend's base-stock calculation (targeting roughly 4 periods of demand) will aim for an inventory level around 800-900 units. Since the effective pipeline is 844, it may order a small amount or nothing, depending on the safety stock calculation. This strategy balances the need to recover from zero stock while acknowledging the large amount of genuine product still in transit.

Carry-over insight: Lost orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units) are confirmed; effective pipeline equals (Reported In-transit - 194). Demand regime since Period 18 is stable at mean ~201 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is stable with a mean of approximately 201 units, which is significantly higher than the initial periods. I will use N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current high-demand regime while filtering out earlier, lower demand data. Lead time remains volatile but averages around 2.4 periods with a mode of 3; however, the backend 'calculate' method will dynamically account for observed arrival patterns. There is a critical discrepancy in the pipeline: 194 units are confirmed lost from orders in Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (43 units). Since the OR engine's 'inventory position' logic is (on_hand + in_transit - demand), and it cannot 'see' that these 194 units will never arrive, it will consistently underestimate the required order size. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * 201 + 194. With L=2 (promised), (1+2)*201 + 194 = 797. This forces the base stock level higher to effectively 'write off' the lost inventory and ensure enough fresh product is ordered to meet the current demand of ~201 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-demand state established around Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 201 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 899 units, but this includes 194 units from confirmed lost orders (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 43 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 705 units. Lead times are volatile, frequently occurring at 3 periods despite the promised 2. To account for this, L is set to 3. \u03bc\u0302 is set using the last 15 periods (approximate start of the high-demand regime) to capture the current mean of ~201 units. \u03c3\u0302 is also set to reflect the higher variance observed in this regime. These parameters ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover demand during the extended lead time while the OR backend manages the pipeline deficit caused by the lost orders.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized in the high-demand state identified at Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and increased variance. Recent demand (P18-P34) averages ~201.7 units. The effective pipeline inventory calculation is critical: the system reports 899 units in-transit, but 194 of these are confirmed lost (151 from P2, 43 from P6), and orders from P15 (148 units), P18 (220 units), and P19 (121 units) are now extremely late (16, 17, and 15 periods elapsed respectively) and also likely lost. Total likely losses are 151+43+148+220+121 = 683 units. The effective pipeline is likely 899 - 683 = 216 units. The actual lead time mode is 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend properly calculates the base stock for the current regime, I will use recent_N with N=17 (covering P18 to P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent service delay, ensuring the backend targets 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline losses updated: Orders from P2 (151), P6 (43), P15 (148), P18 (220), and P19 (121) are confirmed or highly likely lost (total 683 units). Reported in-transit must be adjusted to 216 units for planning. Demand regime P18-P34 is stable at mean ~202 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is stable with a mean of approximately 202 units and high volatility. The reported in-transit inventory of 899 units is heavily skewed by five confirmed or highly likely lost shipments: P2 (151), P6 (43), P15 (148), P18 (220), and P19 (121), totaling 683 lost units. The effective pipeline is actually 216 units (899 - 683). Given the lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (mode 3), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to ensuring the backend calculates requirements for a 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=18 to cover the high-demand regime since P18, ensuring a mean around 202*4. sigma_hat is also set via 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility in this regime. These settings force a base stock that accounts for the actually available pipeline and the sustained higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline losses updated at Period 36: Total lost units = 683 (P2: 151, P6: 43, P15: 148, P18: 220, P19: 121). Effective pipeline is (Reported In-transit - 683).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 32-36) shows a sustained high average of approximately 207 units per period. The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and 899 units reported in-transit. However, historical evidence confirms significant pipeline losses: orders from P2 (151), P6 (43), P15 (148), P18 (220), and P19 (121) are considered lost, totaling 683 units. This leaves an effective in-transit inventory of only 216 units (899 - 683). The actual lead time has stabilized around 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to bridge the gap and satisfy the high demand service level (target quantile q=0.8), I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1 + 3) * 207 = 828. Since current effective pipeline (216) + expected order will be compared against base_stock, setting mu_hat at this level ensures the order covers the lead time and review period at the current higher demand mean. sigma_hat is set to reflect the increased volatility observed in this high-demand regime using the last 15 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lost pipeline units remains at 683 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Recent demand regime (P18-P36) mean updated to ~203 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we observe a significant demand surge in the most recent period (Period 37 demand = 369), which is nearly 80% higher than the already elevated regime mean of ~203. While one data point is not a regime, the context of 'chips(Regular)' suggests potential seasonal or event-driven volatility. We must account for suspected pipeline losses totaling 683 units (P2: 151, P6: 43, P15: 148, P18: 220, P19: 121). Of the reported 899 units in-transit, only 216 units (899 - 683) are considered high-confidence active shipments. To address the demand spike and the degraded pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 230 to provide a buffer against the recent high demand, while keeping L at 3 periods based on historical mode and recent volatility. This high base stock setting encourages the OR backend to place orders that compensate for the 683-unit hole in the reported pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 37 (369 units), compared to the Period 18-36 mean of ~203 units. Total confirmed/likely pipeline losses remain at 683 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we faces a zero on-hand inventory and a distorted in-transit value due to significant historical losses. Based on carry-over insights, the reported in-transit of 998 units includes 683 units from lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19). The effective pipeline is thus 998 - 683 = 315 units. Demand recently experienced a spike in Period 37 (369 units), but returned to a more typical level in Period 38 (214 units). The sustained high-demand regime since Period 18 has a mean of approximately 203 units, but the recent uptick suggests higher volatility. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=21 to cover the high-demand regime (P18-P38), allowing the OR backend to capture the increased mean (~211 across this window). I will also use N=21 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in this period. Although the promised lead time is 2, historical observations show a mode of 3; however, given the OR backend's mechanics and the goal of maintaining service levels during high demand, I will stick with the explicit L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing chips(Regular) where demand has significantly increased starting around Period 18 to a mean of ~200, with a recent spike at Period 37 (369 units) and continued high demand (271 units in Period 39). The critical issue is the massive pipeline distortion: the reported 'In-transit' of 899 units includes 683 units from five confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is actually 216 units (899 - 683). The OR backend is unaware of these losses and will underestimate requirements if we don't adjust mu_hat or sigma_hat to force a higher order. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (Average Demand P18-P39) * (1+L) to account for the sustained regime shift, plus an additional buffer to compensate for the 683 units that the OR backend incorrectly thinks are coming. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on historical mode and conservative planning despite occasional shorter arrivals. Sigma_hat is set to 120 via 'explicit' to account for high recent volatility (e.g., the P37 spike).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P18-P39) mean ~206 units. Effective pipeline is (Reported In-transit - 683) due to confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 analysis shows a critical inventory shortage. On-hand inventory is 0. Reported in-transit is 1373 units, but prior analysis reveals 683 units are confirmed/highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). This leaves an effective pipeline of 690 units (1373 - 683). Demand since Period 18 has established a high-mean regime (approx. 206 units). The spike in Period 37 (369 units) and recent volatility (P38: 214, P39: 271, P40: 172) suggest a need for high safety stock. While recent lead times have shown some 1-period arrivals, the mode and risk profile remain at 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to ensure the backend projects demand over four periods (current + 3 lead). I use recent_N (N=23, from P18 to P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and its significantly increased variance, which helps the OR backend maintain a high service level given the thin margin between profit ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 analysis: The high-demand regime starting from Period 18 remains consistent, though the last two periods (P40-P41) show a slight moderation (avg 168 vs the P18-P39 mean of 206). I will maintain the mu_hat forecast around 206 to hedge against the volatility observed in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 0. Reported in-transit is 1373 units, but significant legacy losses must be addressed. Confirmed/highly likely lost orders: P2(151), P6(43), P15(148), P18(220), P19(121). Total losses = 683 units. Effective pipeline: 1373 - 683 = 690 units. These 690 units include a large order of 474 units from Period 40, which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods given the 3-period lead time mode. Lead time remains volatile but averages 3 periods for planning. By using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the P18-P39 mean, I ensure the OR backend provides enough units to cover the current demand regime despite the pipeline distortions.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 39-42) shows a stabilization at a slightly lower level compared to the Period 18-38 peak, with the last four periods averaging 193 units (271, 172, 164, 175). However, the overall Period 18+ average remains closer to 205. Given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1), a service-level focused approach is preferred. Lead time remains erratic but frequently lands at 3 periods. The critical issue is the distorted In-transit inventory: 1373 units are reported, but 683 units are confirmed lost (P2: 151, P6: 43, P15: 148, P18: 220, P19: 121). Additionally, orders from P24 (76), P29 (100), and P40 (474) are currently in-transit. P24 and P29 are significantly past the observed lead time, totaling 176 more units likely lost. Total likely losses = 683 + 176 = 859. Effective pipeline = 1373 - 859 = 514 units. To ensure the backend doesn't under-order due to 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand mean (~205) over (L+1) periods, and maintain a high sigma_hat for protection against volatility. Setting L=3 as the most realistic estimate.

Carry-over insight: Updated likely pipeline losses at Period 43: orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 (683 units) plus likely losses from P24 (76 units) and P29 (100 units), totaling 859 units lost. Effective pipeline is (Reported In-transit - 859).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P18-P43) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 206 units per period. The arrival of the Period 40 order (474 units) in Period 43 confirms the modal lead time of 3 periods is still active. Inventory management is complicated by significant pipeline losses totaling 859 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). These units remain in the reported 'In-transit' figure of 899 but will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore only 40 units (899 total - 859 lost), representing orders potentially placed very recently (though none are listed since P40). With 307 units on hand and 40 in effective pipeline, the total effective inventory is 347. Based on the target base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) where \u03bc\u0302 covers L+1 periods (4 periods) and z* is roughly 0.84 for the 80% service level, the target is roughly 824 + 0.84 * 100 = 908 units. The current 347 units is significantly below this, so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order. I will use recent_N (N=26) to capture the high-demand regime since Period 18 and explicit lead time of 3 to account for the consistent delivery delay.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 has been stable at a mean of approximately 206 units, although recent periods (since P37) show higher volatility including a spike to 369. Period 44 ending on-hand inventory is 66 units. The reported in-transit of 899 units is heavily inflated by confirmed/likely lost orders: P2(151), P6(43), P15(148), P18(220), P19(121), P24(76), and P29(100), totaling 859 units. Subtracting these from the reported 899 leaves an effective pipeline of only 40 units. With lead time frequently trending toward 3 periods, we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using the recent demand mean of ~206, the required base stock is roughly 824 units. Since on-hand (66) + effective pipeline (40) = 106, the OR backend will trigger a significant order to fill this gap. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to align with observed modal lead time and mu_hat to an explicit value based on the P18-P44 average (~208/period * 4 periods) to ensure sufficient coverage given high lost-order rates.

Carry-over insight: Likely pipeline losses updated: Total lost units = 859 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). Demand regime P18-P44 mean is ~208 units per period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 46, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 899 units. However, based on extensive historical tracking, 859 of these units are highly likely lost (P2: 151, P6: 43, P15: 148, P18: 220, P19: 121, P24: 76, P29: 100). The effective in-transit inventory is therefore only 40 units (899 - 859). The demand regime from Period 18 to 45 is stable with a mean of ~208 units per period, despite high volatility. Lead times remain unstable but the OR backend should plan around the actual observed lead time rather than just the promised 2 periods; I am using 'calculate' to capture the average behavior. Setting L to 'calculate' and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=28 (covering the high-demand regime since P18) will adjust the target base stock to reflect the sustained 200+ unit demand level, while accounting for the significant pipeline losses through the OR engine's internal logic, assuming it uses the reported 899 units as pipeline (which necessitates higher base stock parameters to trigger an order if needed).

Carry-over insight: No new sustained changes detected. Total likely pipeline losses remain at 859 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). Demand regime since P18 is stable at mean ~208 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is stable with a mean of approximately 208 units, although recent periods (P40-P46) show some softening (avg ~180). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), I will prioritize service level by anchoring mu_hat on the established P18+ mean. Total likely pipeline losses remain at 859 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). With the reported In-transit at 899, the effective pipeline is only 40 units (likely the Period 38 order of 99 units was partially fulfilled or there is a minor accounting discrepancy, but 899 - 859 = 40 units is the maximum believable pipeline). On-hand is 0. Lead time remains volatile but the mode and recent successful large delivery (P40) suggest a lead time of 3 periods. I set L=3 and mu_hat using recent_N=29 (covering the regime since P18) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 3-period lead time plus the one-period lookahead.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18-47) is stable with a mean of approximately 208 units per period, although variance remains high. The reported in-transit inventory is 900 units; however, historical analysis proves a significant number of these units are lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (151), P6 (43), P15 (148), P18 (220), P19 (121), P24 (76), and P29 (100) totaling 859 units have not arrived long after their expected window and are considered lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 41 units (900 - 859). With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline that does not cover the expected lead-time demand, a replenishment order is necessary. While the mode lead time is 3 periods, setting L to recent_N (N=5) captures the current operational behavior. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 208 using the explicit method to account for the sustained high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is set using a recent window (N=30) to capture the increased volatility since Period 18.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 48 conclude showed 0 on-hand inventory and the reported 'In-transit' is 900 units. Based on historical carry-over insights, there is a massive discrepancy between reported and effective pipeline inventory due to cumulative lost orders. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 (totaling 683 units), P24 (76 units), and P29 (100 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 859 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is approximately 41 units (900 reported - 859 lost), which likely represents the small order from P47. Demand since Period 18 has been stable at a mean of approximately 208 units per period. With only two decision periods remaining (P49 and P50), and a lead time that typically behaves as 3 periods (meaning orders placed now will likely not arrive until after the simulation ends), the goal is to maximize the utility of remaining stock and correct the base stock calculations for the OR backend. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (since P18) and L to 3 to reflect the realized lead time mode, ensuring the order logic accounts for the missing units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 49, total confirmed/likely pipeline losses remain at 859 units (P2: 151, P6: 43, P15: 148, P18: 220, P19: 121, P24: 76, P29: 100). Reported In-transit is significantly inflated.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the final decision point. The demand regime since Period 18 has been stable at a mean of approximately 208 units per period, despite high volatility. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 900 units. However, as documented in the carry-over insights, a significant portion of this is likely lost. Specifically, we have identified 859 units as lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 43, P15: 148, P18: 220, P19: 121, P24: 76, P29: 100). Subtracting these lost units from the reported 900 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of only 41 units (likely the 40 units from P17 or the 1 unit from P47, though the 40 from P17 is likely a mistake in the earlier loss calculation logic\u2014regardless, the effective pipeline is near zero). To meet the high demand regime (mean 208) and account for the 3-period lead time, we need to set L to the observed mode of 3 and use the recent demand regime since P18 to forecast. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (3+1) periods of demand (~832 units). Given the effective pipeline is nearly empty and on-hand is 0, the engine will order to replenish.
