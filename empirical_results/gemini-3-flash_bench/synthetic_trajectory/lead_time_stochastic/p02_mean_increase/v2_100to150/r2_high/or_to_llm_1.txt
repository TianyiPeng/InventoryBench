{

The historical demand for Periods 1-3 was 156, 117, and 90, showing a downward trend but still averaging around 121 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the history: Period 1 order (126 units) hasn't arrived yet (it should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 3 conclude, but 'arrived=0' was reported). This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods rather than 2, or there's a delay. Total in-transit is 401 units (from orders in P1, P2, and P3). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have stocked out for 3 periods already. The OR recommendation is 0 units because it likely sees the 401 units in the pipeline as sufficient to cover the base stock level calculated from historical demand. However, given the lead-time uncertainty and the fact that we have 0 on-hand inventory while demand is ~100+, I need to ensure we don't continue to stock out if the pipeline is delayed. Current in-transit (401) covers roughly 3.3 periods of demand. If the P1 order (126) arrives in Period 4, P2 in Period 5, and P3 in Period 6, we are covered. Ordering 0 as suggested by OR is the safest move to avoid overstocking once the massive pipeline finally lands, especially since the holding cost is $1/unit and we already have 400+ units coming.",

Strategy: The OR recommends 71 units based on a capped base-stock model.

The P20 drop (94) might be noise or stockout-related visibility issues, but the spike in P19 (238) suggests we must prepare for higher volume.\n\n3.

The average demand for the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 155 units (152, 238, 94, 136).

The lack of arrivals in P21 and P22 suggests the systemic lead time may have stretched beyond 3 periods or that the supplier is currently in a failure state. 3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was detected at P18.

Current demand has shifted to a higher regime (~140-160 range). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and the next reliable arrival (P25's 210 units) happens during this period's resolution but isn't usable until P29, we are at risk of a stockout.

First, it relies on a system 'In-transit' value of 1,636 units, which is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that were lost but never cleared from the pipeline. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, orders from P2 (155), P6 (71), P18 (110), P19 (115), and P25 (210) are confirmed lost, totaling 661 ghost units. Furthermore, recent data suggests the P33 (180 units) and P35 (180 units) orders may also be at risk given the supplier's ~30-40% loss rate, though they aren't technically 'lost' by the 6-period rule yet. Second, the demand regime shifted around Period 18 from ~100 to ~140-160 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is only 59 units. To cover the next 3 periods of demand (avg 150/period = 450 total) and account for the high probability of shipment failure, I must maintain a consistent ordering cadence. I will order 180 units, matching the recent replenishment strategy, as the true pipeline (1636 total - 661 ghost = 975) is still spread across several future periods with high uncertainty.",

However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 661 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, P25). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 795 units (1456 - 661). This includes open orders from Period 27-37 (excluding P31 and others that already arrived). Specifically, the P37 order of 180 units is likely arriving in Period 39 or 40. Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized at a higher regime of approximately 150 units/period since Period 18. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely calculates the bloated system In-transit (1456) against the base stock, resulting in a negative net requirements calculation. However, even with the corrected effective pipeline (795), we have significant coverage (approx. 5 periods worth of demand at 150/unit). The 180 units ordered in P37 should arrive shortly. Given the lead time is varying between 1-3 periods and current on-hand of 116 is enough for the upcoming demand resolution (approx 150), and huge bulk already in transit, I will order a small amount to maintain a steady flow and mitigate further potential losses, while acknowledging we currently have a large volume of recently placed orders (P34-P37) that are still arriving.",

Analyzing recent history, the Period 44 order (190 units) is expected in Period 47, and the Period 45 order (100 units) is expected around Period 48, assuming the current stabilized lead time of 3 periods. Current On-hand is 346. Total reliable inventory (On-hand + non-ghost In-transit) is 346 + (1746 - 1021) = 1071 units. Demand has stabilized at approximately 150 units/period. Over the next 4 periods (lead time + review), expected demand is ~600 units (150 * 4). While 1071 units appears to cover this, the high supplier loss rate (historically ~20-30%) and the fact that we are nearing the end of the game (Period 50) suggest we should maintain a safety buffer to avoid final period stockouts.

Furthermore, the orders from P37 (180 units) and P40 (80 units) are overdue by 8-11 periods and should also be considered lost (+260 units). The order from P44 (190 units) is now 4 periods old (past the typical 3-period actual lead time), posing a risk. Excluding clearly lost units (1021 + 260 = 1281), the 'real' pipeline is 1896 - 1281 = 615 units. \n\nDemand Analysis: Current demand regime has stabilized at ~155 units per period. With the game ending at Period 50, we only need to cover demand for P48, P49, and P50 (approx. 465 units total). \n\nSupply Outlook: P45 order (100 units) and P46 order (150 units) are within the normal arrival window. Combined with current on-hand (15), we have 265 units likely to arrive/be available before the end. The P44 order (190 units) is the 'swing' factor; if it arrives, we have 455 units, which is nearly perfect. \n\nDecision: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees the massive system 'In-transit' figure and assumes we are overstocked. Even when accounting for ghost inventory, our 'real' pipeline (615 units) + on-hand (15) exceeds the remaining demand (approx. 465).
