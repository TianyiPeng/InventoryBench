The initial historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) result in an average demand of 97.2 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 126 units, based on a base-stock policy that accounts for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given that our holding cost ($1.0) is equal to our profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand to minimize total costs. However, since we are starting at zero inventory and have a 2-period lead time gap to bridge, we must secure stock immediately.

However, because the P1 order is delayed, we face a supply gap.

However, history shows high variability: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 3), while Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 1). This suggests the supplier is inconsistent but generally averages out near the promised 2 periods. 2. Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand is 62. In-transit consists of orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 4 (100 units). The Period 2 order is now at T+3 and is overdue/expected to arrive in Period 5. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is [139, 114, 117, 112, 85]. Mean demand is approximately 113. 4. OR Baseline: The OR agent recommends only 18 units, likely because it sees 243 units in-transit against a base-stock level calculated with L=2. However, the OR agent doesn't account for the high cost of stockouts (lost profit) versus holding cost. 5. Adjustment: With 62 on hand and a mean demand of ~113, I will likely stock out in Period 5 before the next shipment arrives. While the pipeline is technically full (243 units), the timing is risky. I will increase the order slightly above the OR recommendation to 60 units to buffer against the high demand variance and lead-time inconsistency, ensuring I have enough stock if the overdue Period 2 shipment arrives late or if Period 6 demand spikes.",

Recent demand is slightly higher than initial samples, but stable around 110. \n4. Strategy: The OR baseline suggests 18 units, which assumes the pipeline (303) covers almost all required stock for the (L+1) window. However, the P2 order of 143 units is significantly overdue (ordered P2, now P6) and highly likely lost. If we subtract the 143 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 160 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is stable around 110 units/period (Mean: 97, though recent periods are consistently ~100-117). 4.

Strategy: With 164 on-hand and an average demand significantly lower than in the early game, the stock covers roughly 2-3 periods. Since OR recommends 0 and we have substantial inventory relative to current low demand (164 on-hand vs ~50-60 demand), ordering more right now would likely lead to high holding costs ($1/unit).

Demand Analysis: While a previous insight suggested a regime shift to ~53 units, Period 9 demand spiked to 125, bringing the recent 3-period average back to approximately 77 units (60, 46, 125). This suggests the previous 'regime shift' may have been a temporary dip rather than a sustained change. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 119. In-transit is 258 units, though 143 units from P2 are lost, and 115 units from P6 are significantly overdue (ordered 4 periods ago), making their arrival questionable. Effectively, the reliable pipeline is 0 because the P8 order (80 units) already arrived. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units, likely driven by the calculation of on-hand (119) plus the phantom in-transit (258) against the historical mean (approx 100). 5. Strategy: I must ignore the lost P2 (143) and severely delayed P6 (115) units. Our effective inventory is 119 on-hand.

Looking at the history: P6 order (115) is 4 periods overdue (presumed lost), P9 order was 0, and P10 order was 50. This means the 308 in-transit likely consists of the lost P6 order (115) and orders from P7/P8/P9 that I am assuming are still in the pipeline system-wise but might be delayed or lost. 3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 6. With demand at ~115-120 units/period, I need stock for Periods 11, 12, and 13 (L+1). Total requirement is ~360 units. Pipeline (excluding lost P6 order) contains P10's 50 units and potentially P7-P9 remnants. 4. **Decision**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 308 in-transit and a lower historical average.

This pipeline consists of: P13 (130 units), P14 (120 units), and P16 (current decision). Note: The game states In-transit is 508 units before my P16 decision, which implies P13 and P14 orders are still pending.

The Period 14 order (120 units) is expected to arrive during either Period 17 (3-day lead) or Period 16 (which would have been visible now). Since it hasn't concluded yet, it is moderately late but not yet lost. 2. Pipeline Analysis: On-hand inventory is critically low (3 units). In-transit inventory is 378 units, consisting of orders from P14 (120), P15 (0), and P16 (0, though the status says 378 total, suggesting P14's 120 and potentially massive orders from earlier that are yet to surface or were misrepresented in the total). Looking at history: Pipeline includes P14 (120), P15 (0), P16 (0), plus older potentially lost or arriving orders. However, the 'In-transit: 378' figure indicates a significant amount of stock is theoretically on the way. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been high (P16: 163, P15: 103, P14: 61, P13: 97, P12: 95). The average of the last 5 periods is 103.8 units. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR proposes 0 units because it likely views the 378 in-transit units as sufficient to cover upcoming demand. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0), over-ordering carries high risk. However, with only 3 units on hand and a volatile supplier, a small 'insurance' order is warranted to prevent a stockout in Period 19/20 if the P14 order is lost or if demand continues to spike.

This leaves an effective pipeline of only 200 units (the order placed in P26).

Given a 2-3 period lead time, the P26 order (200 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 28 or Period 29.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand since the regime shift at Period 16 is approximately 176 units per period (P16-P27). Current demand is strong (199 in P27).\n\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it does not account for the 608 phantom units and sees a massive pipeline of 988.

The supply chain is relatively stable compared to the early game, though volatility remains.\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 134 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1388 is highly misleading due to 1148 units of identified phantom inventory (periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 29, 30). The true effective pipeline consist only of the order from P37 (180 units) and P39 (60 units). However, checking P37's arrival is crucial: looking at Period 39 conclude, only P38 (120 units) arrived. The 180 units from Period 37 (ordered at Period 37, expected arrival P38-P39) have NOT arrived yet. This makes P37 the next expected arrival.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P33-P39) averages ~120-125 units, excluding the spike to 156 in P39. The current regime is roughly 125 units/period.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely sees the massive (but phantom) pipeline of 1388 units. To cover Period 40 demand (~125), we have 134 units on hand, which is sufficient for one period. However, we must order to cover the (L+1) horizon. With L=2, we need ~375 units (125 * 3) in the system. Real units = 134 (on-hand) + 180 (P37 in-transit) + 60 (P39 in-transit) = 374 units. This is almost exactly the target stock level. \n5. **Adjustment**: I will place a small safety order of 60 units. While the current pipeline technically covers the mean demand, the high holding cost ($1.0) vs. profit ($1.0) means the critical fractile is 0.5, justifying a lean inventory.

Demand has returned to a high regime of approximately 165-175 units per period. The reported 'In-transit' of 1858 units is heavily inflated by 1148 'phantom' units (confirmed/likely lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30).

It fails to account for the massive stockout risk caused by the 1148 phantom units and the current high demand. To cover the lead time (avg 2-3 periods) + current period demand, we need to ensure we have ~660 units (165 demand * 4 periods) in the effective pipeline. Currently, we have ~530.

Specifically, orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 29, and 30 (totaling 1,148 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost. Subtracting these from the 1,688 units leaves an effective pipeline of 540 units. Since Period 41, demand has stabilized at a higher regime of approximately 165-185 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 212. To cover the effective lead time (historically 1-3 periods, recently averaging 2-3) plus the current period's demand, I need to ensure the total inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) can sustain roughly 3-4 periods of demand (~500-650 units).

These 810 units correspond to orders from Periods 44 (180), 45 (180), 46 (120), and 47 (150), plus an older order from Period 37 (180). Lead-Time Analysis: Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. The Period 44 order (placed P44) is expected in P47 conclude (if LT=3), but hasn't arrived. It is expected to arrive in Period 48. Strategy: We are at Period 48 of 50. Orders placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 50 (if LT=2) or Period 51 (if LT=3). Since the game ends at Period 50, an order placed now with a likely 3-period lead time will not arrive in time to be sold. Even with a 2-period lead time, it would arrive for the final period.

Based on a lead time of 2-3 periods, the P44 and P45 orders should have arrived, but haven't yet, meaning they are likely to arrive in Period 49 or 50. Pipeline Correction: There are significant phantom units (1148) in the 'In-transit' count (1958) representing lost shipments from earlier periods. Effective pipeline is approx 810 units. Strategy: Since Period 50 is the final period, any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 50 (if lead time is 1) or later (after the game ends).
