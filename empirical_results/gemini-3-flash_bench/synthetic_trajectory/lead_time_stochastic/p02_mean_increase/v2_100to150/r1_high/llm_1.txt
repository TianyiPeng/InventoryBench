Based on the historical demand provided for the first five periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the average demand is approximately 97 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be available for demand in Period 3 and visible in the Period 4 start message. For the decision at Period 1, I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). Expected total demand for these 3 periods is roughly 300 units (3 * 100). Since current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I will order 300 units to establish a baseline stock that accounts for the initial lead time delay and provides a small buffer for variance.",

With lead times varying between 1-3 periods, I need to cover demand for the current period (P28) plus the lead time (avg 2-3). Target pipeline for 4 periods of demand at ~180/period is 720 units. Since the active pipeline is exactly 720, and current on-hand is 0, I must order to cover the next immediate demand cycle. I will order 200 units to maintain the pipeline and ensure stock availability as soon as the P24/P25 orders arrive (expected in P28 or P29).",

Since demand occurs after our decision and arrivals happen before demand within the same period (if lead time allows), placing an order for Period 50 could potentially satisfy Period 50 demand if it arrives with a lead time of 0. However, the history shows that the minimum actual lead time observed is 1 period (e.g., P31, P32, P36, P38, P39). An order placed now (Period 50) would arrive, at the earliest, in Period 51.
