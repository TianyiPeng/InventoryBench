Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). This suggests a high target service level. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are given in the prompt even though we are technically 'deciding' for Period 1 in the sequence) shows an average of ~97 units. Based on the GAME MECHANISM, arrival happens after the decision, so we need to set initial parameters to cover the promised lead time (2) plus the current period (1). I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use the provided samples for an initial baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 126 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected per the 'Critical Timing Example', this order did not arrive in Period 1 (arrived=0) and remains 'In-transit'. Demand in P1 was 139, which was lost as we started with 0 inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the hidden history provided in the prompt) shows values: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, and the observed P1 demand in the game was 139. The mean of the 5 historical samples is 97.2. Adding P1 demand (139), the 6-sample mean is 104.1. Since it's early in the game and there's no evidence of a lead-time shift yet (L=2 is the promise), I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a stable baseline including the recent P1 observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 139 and 114 (avg 126.5), which aligns with the provided samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 126 units; in Period 2, we ordered 143 units. Total in-transit is 269 units. Since L=2, the Period 1 order (126 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to the lead time gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial baseline (using the 5 provided samples: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85; mean=97.2, std=16.6). This will set a conservative base stock until the first shipments arrive and we can verify actual lead times.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the history: Period 1's order (126 units) was placed during the decision phase of P1. With a lead time of 2, it should arrive during Period 1+2=3. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. The demand history (139, 114, 117) averages around 123 units per period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a significant pipeline (381 units), we need to account for the extended lead time to ensure the base stock calculation covers the longer arrival window. I will explicitly set L=3 based on the observation that the P1 order did not arrive in P3. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical data (N=3) to estimate demand for the (L+1) period window.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Order from P1 did not arrive in P3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2002.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 conclude, we observed two arrivals: the P1 order (126 units) arrived with a lead_time of 3, and the P3 order (112 units) arrived with a lead_time of 1. The average lead time observed so far is (3+1)/2 = 2.0. The promised lead time is 2, and the average is currently 2, so using 'calculate' or 'default' for L is appropriate. Demand history for 5 periods shows [139, 114, 117, 112, 85] (using conclude demand data where available and the history provided in the prompt: 139 replaced the seed data for P1, P2-P4 conclude data shows 114, 117, 112, and P5 seed is 85). Mean demand is ~113. With L=2, mu_hat should reflect demand over (1+L)=3 periods. Mean (113) * 3 = 339. Sigma is approximately 19 * sqrt(3) \u2248 33. On-hand is 126 and In-transit is 289 (Total 415), which currently covers the target base stock, so any order will likely be capped or zero. I will use 'calculate' for L and 'default' for mu/sigma to allow the backend to use all 5 data points.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1914.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Inventory levels are low (24 units) following a demand of 102 units in Period 5. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) averages approximately 97 units per period. In terms of lead time, we have observed significant variability: one order took 3 periods (P1 order) and another took 1 period (P3 order), while the P2 order (placed Period 2) is currently overdue as of the end of Period 5. Given the promised lead time is 2, the average observed lead time remains 2 periods ((3+1)/2). I will continue using the default lead time of 2 (setting L results in evaluation of L+1 periods of demand), but I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand cruise-speed of ~97 units/period while accounting for the high volatility observed in the sample data (standard deviation ~17 units). This approach ensures we maintain enough base stock to cover demand over 3 periods (decision, L=2) while the system catches up on pipeline reconciliation.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (143 units) is overdue: Expected arrival was P4 or P5; as of P6 start (P5 conclude), it hasn't arrived. Pipeline remains heavy (367 units) due to this lag.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 367 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 112 units (samples: 139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102 - including lost sales demand). The lead time is highly volatile: Observed lead times are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). Crucially, the P2 order (143 units) and P4 order (146 units) are now significantly overdue (placed in P2 and P4, expected by P5/P6). Since the system only allows one 'conclude' message per period and we've seen arrivals from P1 and P3, but P2 and P4 are absent despite being older/promised at L=2, there is a risk of shipment loss or significant delay. Given the high pipeline (367 units) relative to demand (~112/period), we must avoid over-ordering which would lead to high holding costs if these bulk orders arrive simultaneously. I will use L=2 (the average and promised) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand periods to capture the current regime (~110 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Shipment risk: Orders from P2 (143 units) and P4 (146 units) are now overdue as of P7 start, potentially lost or stuck in a long-tail lead time scenario.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1054.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have observed actual lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3). The order from P2 (143 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order) and is likely lost. The order from P5 (78 units) and P7 (94 units) are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 86 units. Historical demand across the last 7 periods (139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102, 60) shows a downward trend, especially the most recent period. However, the average demand remains around 106. Using the promised lead time of L=2 (which is also the average of observed lead times 3, 1, and 3) and a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand captures the recent softening while maintaining enough stock (base stock \u2248 3 periods of demand). Since one order (P2) is likely lost but still in the 'In-transit' count, the backend's 'cap' and 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction might suppress ordering too much; setting L to 2 and using recent_N for mu and sigma allows the OR logic to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from P2 (143 units) highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Recent demand (Period 7) dropped significantly to 60 units compared to previous average of ~110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $662.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe high on-hand inventory (212 units) relative to recent demand. Demand has shown a significant downward trend over the last two periods (60 units in P7, 46 units in P8), shifting the historical mean of ~110 towards a lower regime. The order from P2 (143 units) is still missing and is now 7 periods old; given that all other orders (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) have arrived with lead times of 1 or 3 periods, the P2 order is almost certainly lost. This lost order is still incorrectly counted as 'In-transit' in the system's pipeline inventory. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I will keep mu_hat at a level that accounts for the (L+1) horizon while acknowledging the lower recent demand. Using recent_N (N=4) captures the recent mean of ~77 units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (average of 1 and 3 periods is 2). Inventory is currently sufficient to cover at least 4 periods of the new demand regime, so parameters are set to stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~117 (Periods 1-6) to ~53 (Periods 7-8). Order from Period 2 (143 units) remains missing after 7 periods and is considered lost.

Daily Profit: $2375.00, Daily Holding Cost: $87.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2288.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern has become highly volatile. After a low-demand period (60 in P7, 46 in P8), Period 9 bounced back to 125, which is closer to the initial regime (Periods 1-6 average approx 115). The mean for the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 77, but the last period shows a potential return to previous levels. To balance this, I am using recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the most recent volatility while hedging against the high ending inventory (87 on-hand). Regarding lead times, we have observed 1, 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods. The 'promised' is 2, and the average is 2.2. The order from Period 2 (143 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is definitely lost; however, the pipeline inventory still includes it. By using L=2 (default), the backend will calculate a base stock for 3 periods of demand. Since on-hand (87) + in-transit (193, though 143 is lost) = 280, and 3 periods of demand at the current rate is ~231, the OR engine will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the 87 on-hand and the likely arrival of the P9 order (50 units) soon.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 9 demand (125) spiked after two significantly low periods (~53 average), suggesting the low-regime was temporary or intermittent. In-transit accuracy: Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods: after a drop to approx. 53 units/period (P7-P8), it rebounded to an average of 119 over the last two periods (P9-P10), which is consistent with the initial baseline (P1-P6 avg: 115). I will treat the P7-P8 drop as a temporary anomaly and base the forecast on a recent_N of 4 to capture the return to normal demand levels (~86 average). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is backordered for 26 units (demand 113, sold 87 in P10). In-transit inventory includes the Period 9 order (50) and Period 10 order (72), totaling 122 units after removing the lost Period 2 order (143 units) from mental pipeline math. Lead times are inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed average (mean is 2.2). Using recent_N=4 for Mu and Sigma provides a responsive but stable estimate given the recent bounce-back.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Rebounded to ~119 units in P9-P10 after a temporary dip in P7-P8. Period 2 order (143 units) is removed from pipeline logic as it is considered lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). The demand history shows a recovery from the Period 7-8 dip, with the last three periods (P9-P11) averaging 103 units, which is close to the long-term average. The Period 2 order (143 units) is officially categorized as lost (9 periods elapsed), meaning the true in-transit inventory is 272 (415 - 143). Based on the 'conclude' messages, we have observed lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods, resulting in an average lead time of 2.2 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage the full lead time history. For demand (mu_hat), I will use recent_N=5 (Periods 7-11) to balance the recent dip with the recovery, as Period 11 demand dropped again to 71. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the recent high volatility (ranging from 46 to 125).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, two shipments arrived: Period 9 (lead time 3) and Period 10 (lead time 2). This confirms that lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.25 periods based on all observed arrivals (excluding the lost Period 2 order). Current on-hand inventory is 27, and there are 323 units in transit. However, 143 of those 323 units are from Period 2 and are confirmed lost (11 periods elapsed). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 180 units (from Period 11 and 12). Demand has shown significant volatility; after a dip in Periods 7-8 (~53 avg), it returned to a higher range of 95-125 in Periods 9-10, then dropped to 71 and 95 in Periods 11-12. The overall average demand from Period_1 to Period_12 is approximately 99.5 units. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent mean of ~88.5, while maintaining default lead time logic as the average holds near the promised 2.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), despite some earlier volatility. The order history shows a mix of 1-period and 3-period lead times (Average ~2.2 periods). Crucially, the order from P11 (150 units) is overdue based on the promised 2-period lead time but falls within the observed 3-period window, expected to arrive in Period 14 or 15. The total in-transit quantity is 458 units (P11: 150, P12: 30, P13: 135, P2: 143 lost). I will calculate parameters using a recent window (N=5) to reflect the stabilized demand mean (~100) and set L=3 to account for the frequent observed 3-period deliveries, preventing premature reordering while waiting for the P11/P13 pipeline to land. Note: The backend will subtract the 458 units in-transit (including the lost P2 order) from the base stock; I assume the backend logic handles the P2 discrepancy or the high pipeline will buffer against stockouts once the P11 order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~100 units (N=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1070.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 89 units. The 'In-transit' total of 318 units includes shipments from Period 2 (143 units), Period 12 (30 units), Period 13 (135 units), and Period 14 (10 units). As previously identified, the Period 2 order is considered lost (13 periods elapsed). Subtracting this lost shipment, the effective pipeline is 175 units (30 + 135 + 10). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P9, P10, P11) averaging 2.6 periods. Since it is safer to assume the promised lead time of 2 under the backend's capped policy when the pipeline is partially filled, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the historical average (approx. 2.2). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 units over the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier in P14). I use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this current regime while maintaining the standard safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: In-transit correction: Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost; effective pipeline is 175 units. Effective lead time for parameter setting is currently averaging 2.2 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 16 units on-hand and 300 units in-transit. However, the order from Period 2 (143 units) has never arrived after 14 periods and is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 157 units (300 total - 143 lost units from Period 2). Demand has transitioned into a more stable but slightly volatile regime; the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show an average demand of 87.4, while a broader look at the last 10 periods (P6-P15) averages 87.4 as well, suggesting a normalization around 90-100 units compared to early volatility. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), P9(3), P10(2), P11(3), P12(3). The average observed lead time is 2.44 periods, which is higher than the promised 2. Lead time (L) is set to 2.44 (explicit) to account for this lag. Demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of 87.4 units/period, which across (1+L) periods ensures adequate coverage while balancing holding costs against the current inventory low.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 199 (Period 14: 10, Period 15: 12, Period 16: 34, plus older units). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (143 units) is consistently identified as lost in history and Carry-over Insights (8+ periods elapsed). Excluding this lost order, the functional pipeline is approximately 56 units. Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times are inconsistent, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average ~2.2-2.5). I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent variability. Demand Analysis: Demand has shown volatility but averages around 98 units over the last 10 periods, with a recent spike to 163 in Period 16. I will use mu_hat = recent_N (N=7) to capture both the recent spike and the underlying mean of approximately 100-110 units per period. This strategy aims to build back safety stock given the current 0 on-hand status and unreliable delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Effective pipeline is 56 units (excluding lost Period 2 order of 143 units). High demand volatility confirmed with Period 16 spike (163 units) following a period of relative stability around 100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent periods (P16-P17) spiking to a mean of 165 units, up from a previous average of ~100. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The nominal lead time is 2, but actual observations reveal a distribution of 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Importantly, the Period 2 order (143 units) is confirmed lost, so while 'In-transit' shows 310 units, the effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 15 (12), Period 17 (155), and the current Period 18 decision. Using L=2.2 (explicit) to reflect actual leads. Demand \u03bc\u0302 is set to 256 using an EWMA with gamma 0.3 to weigh the recent spikes (163, 167) against history, while \u03c3\u0302 is set explicitly to 50 to cushion against the current high volatility and stockout risk (given on-hand is zero).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~165 (+65%) over the last two periods. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must permanently exclude the lost P2 order (143 units).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge that began in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has averaged 172 units, compared to the prior baseline of ~100. The lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.2 periods. The total in-transit quantity is 516 units, but this includes the 143 units from Period 2 (which is confirmed lost after 17 periods) and the 12 units from Period 15 (now at lead time 4, suggesting it may also be lost or delayed). Excluding the Period 2 loss, the effective pipeline is 373 units. Since we are currently in a high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean of ~172 and the associated high volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed lead time average (approx 2.2), which appropriately reflects the current system lag.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~172 (+72%) over the last 3 periods (P16-P18). Period 15 order (12 units) is now overdue (lead time 4) and may be lost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has averaged approximately 174 units (163, 167, 186, 181), which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~100. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last four periods. The total 'In-transit' is 709 units, but this includes the confirmed lost Period 2 order (143 units). Additionally, the Period 15 order (12 units) is now overdue (lead time 5) and potentially lost. Effective pipeline is approximately 554 units. Observed lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging around 2.2. Therefore, I will use L=explicit (2.2) and mu_hat=recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand surge. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime sustained: Mean demand from P16-P19 is ~174 units (+74% shift from previous baseline). Period 15 order (12 units) is now highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 16-20) has stabilized at a significantly higher mean. The last five periods of demand (163, 167, 186, 181, 184) average 176.2 units. Comparing this to the previous regime (approx. 100 units), we have a sustained shift of +76%. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with an observed average of approximately 2.2. Currently, there are 709 units in transit; however, we must adjust the effective pipeline inventory logic because the Period 2 order (143 units) and the Period 15 order (12 units) are highly likely lost (8 and 5 periods elapsed respectively). Total 'lost' units = 155. Effective in-transit = 709 - 155 = 554 units. With on-hand inventory at 0, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). I will set mu_hat to 528.6 (176.2 * 3) and sigma_hat using the recent 5-period volatility to ensure we catch this high-demand surge without being over-penalized by the lost shipments still appearing in the raw pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~176 (+76%) over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). In-transit integrity: Period 2 order (143 units) and Period 15 order (12 units) are confirmed lost; pipeline inventory should be manually adjusted by -155 units.

The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 169.67 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100 units. Although P21 showed a slight dip to 137, it remains well above the historical average. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this new elevated regime. Lead times have been highly inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times (approx 2.4 periods). Regarding inventory, the on-hand is currently 0. The total in-transit is 740 units, but this includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (143 units) and Period 15 (12 units), totaling 155 units. The OR backend's 'cap' mechanism subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. If the pipeline is overinflated by lost units, the backend will under-order. To compensate for the 155 'ghost' units in the pipeline and the shift in demand, I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to target the higher demand mean (~170 units per period), ensuring the service level is maintained during this high-demand phase despite reaching the backend order cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand roughly 170 units post-P16 (+70% shift). Cumulative lost inventory (P2 & P15) equals 155 units; this must be mentally accounted for as the official in-transit figure is permanently inflated.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 173.3 units over the last 7 periods (P16-P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 740 units. However, based on longitudinal tracking, 155 units are confirmed lost (P2: 143 units, P15: 12 units). The effective pipeline is therefore 585 units. These 585 units consist of orders from P17 (155), P18 (206), P19 (193), and P21 (31). Given the historical lead time variability (alternating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2+), many of these units are expected to arrive in Period 23 or 24. Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy and is unaware of the lost 155 units, it would normally under-order because it thinks those 155 units are still coming. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the target based on the high demand regime (~173 units/period) and L=3 to account for the current lead time lag and inventory depletion. This forces a higher base stock (\u03bc * (1+L)) to compensate for the lost pipeline and ensure better service levels during this sustained high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: The high-demand regime (mean ~173) is now sustained for 7 periods (P16-P22). Effective pipeline reconciliation: 155 units (from P2 and P15) are permanently lost and must be manually subtracted from the system's 'In-transit' count for ordering decisions.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained with a mean of ~173 units over the last 8 periods (P16-P23). However, the system is experiencing a critical stockout due to significant lead time delays and lost shipments. The 'In-transit' count of 718 units is heavily inflated by lost orders: P2 (143 units) and P15 (12 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 155 units. Furthermore, large orders from P17 (155), P18 (206), and P19 (193) are now overdue (lead times of 6, 5, and 4 periods respectively), given the promised lead time of 2. Because the OR backend uses a capped policy based on pipeline inventory and promised lead time, it is failing to order enough units to satisfy this new high-demand regime during these delivery delays. To bridge this gap, I am explicitly increasing the lead time parameter (L) to 4 to reflect the current delay trend and using an explicit mu_hat based on the high-demand mean of 173 over (1+L)=5 periods (173 * 5 = 865). This forces the backend to aim for a higher base stock, accounting for the reality of delayed arrivals and inflated pipeline figures.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis confirmed: Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 554 units) are significantly overdue as of P24 start, suggesting an actual lead time shift to 5+ periods or severe congestion.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 172 units over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). We face a critical supply chain disruption: orders from P17 (155 units), P18 (206 units), and P19 (193 units) are significantly overdue (6-8 periods elapsed), while P21 arrived in 2 periods. This suggests severe lead time bifurcation rather than linear drift. The current 'In-transit' of 918 units includes 155 units confirmed lost (P2, P15) and 554 units (P17-P19) that are likely stuck or lost. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the system's 918. I am using an explicit L of 6 to account for the actual delay observed in recent large batches and recent_N for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the sustained high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility in this high-demand stage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis escalating: Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (554 units total) are now 6-8 periods overdue, indicating a shift in lead time mean to 6+ periods for major shipments. Demand regime remains high at ~172 units. Total confirmed/likely lost units in pipeline inventory: 709 units (P2=143, P15=12, P17=155, P18=206, P19=193).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a catastrophic lead-time crisis and significant stockouts. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a high-demand regime, averaging ~175 units over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). However, the primary issue is the 'In-transit' figure: of the 1105 units reported, 709 units are highly likely lost or severely overdue. Specifically, orders from P2 (143), P15 (12), P17 (155), P18 (206), and P19 (193) have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time. Recent smaller orders (P21, P23) arrived in 2 periods, but large bulk orders are failing to clear. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 6 to account for the actual delay seen in the high-demand orders and using an explicit mu_hat of 1225 (representing (1+L=7) * 175 average demand). This forces the engine to target a base stock that recognizes the actual lead-time reality and the effectively empty pipeline. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 100 to account for variance during this supply disruption.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis confirmed: Severe delay for large batches. Orders totaling 709 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are considered lost or in long-tail delay (>6 periods). Effective pipeline is currently only 396 units (P24, P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand regime remains high at ~170 units (mean P16-P26 is 172.5). The lead time crisis is critical: major orders from P17 (155), P18 (206), and P19 (193) are severely overdue (lead times of 10, 9, and 8 periods respectively), while smaller, more recent orders (P21, P23) arrived in 2 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1343 units includes significant ghost inventory: P2(143), P15(12), P17(155), P18(206), and P19(193) total 709 units that are effectively lost or permanently delayed. Effective pipeline is only 634 units (P24, P25, P26). Because the OR backend cannot distinguish between lost and valid pipeline units, I must use 'explicit' L and 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher order volume. I set L to 5 to account for the increased lead time mean due to the delays. I set mu_hat to 1200 (approx (1+5)*200) to ensure the system targets a pipeline large enough to overcome the 709 ghost units and satisfy the ~172 units/period demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Massive lead time divergence - small orders (under 50 units) arrive in ~2 periods, while large batch orders (over 150 units) are currently delayed by 8-10+ periods or lost. Effective ghost inventory in pipeline reaches 709 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 172 units over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). However, there is a severe lead-time bifurcation: small orders (<50 units) arrive within 1-2 periods, while large orders (>150 units) are experiencing massive delays or losses. Specifically, orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 709 units) are significantly overdue and must be considered 'ghost' inventory. Total In-transit is reported at 1343, but subtracting these 709 likely lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 634 units (comprised of P24=200, P25=196, and P26=238). To account for this effective pipeline vs. reported in-transit gap (709 units), I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that is (1+L)*172 PLUS the 709 'ghost' units. This forces the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) to compensate for the missing shipments. Using L=2 as the operational lead time for recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time divergence confirmed: Large orders (>150 units) from P17, P18, P19 are now 8+ periods overdue and considered lost alongside P2 and P15 shipments. Total ghost inventory in pipeline equals 709 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 analysis: Demand is sustained in a high-demand regime (post-Period 16 average ~173 units). The current period 28 conclude showed a 238-unit arrival from Period 26, confirming a lead time of 2. However, the lead-time crisis persists for larger/older shipments. The 'In-transit' figure is 1105, which includes 709 units from orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are 10+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. The effective pipeline inventory consists of P24 (200 units) and P25 (196 units). Total visible/effective inventory: On-hand (75) + Effective Pipeline (396) = 471 units. Given the demand is ~173/period and L=2, the total requirement for (L+1) periods is ~519 units. The actual lead time is volatile (1 to 3+ periods), so setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (mean ~173). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit Integrity: As of Period 29, 709 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost/permanently delayed (10+ periods). The effective pipeline contains 396 units (P24, P25).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system shows an In-transit balance of 1105 units. Based on historical analysis, 709 of these units are considered lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The P17, P18, and P19 orders (totaling 554 units) are now 10+ periods overdue, which aligns with the pattern established by the previously lost P2 and P15 shipments where large orders (>150 units) fail to arrive. This leaves an effective pipeline of 396 units (from P24, P25), which are now also past their promised lead time of 2 (currently 4-5 periods overdue). However, Period 26's order of 238 units arrived in Period 28 (LT=2), suggesting lead times for large orders are unstable rather than universally broken. Current demand is sustained in a high regime averaging ~175 units (P16-P29). I am setting L=3 to account for the observed average lead time of successful deliveries and mu_hat to 700 (175 * 4) to cover demand across the lead time + review period. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent demand volatility (144 to 200). Pipeline integrity remains the primary risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmation of 'Ghost Pipeline' - 709 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Large orders are high-risk: while P26 (238 units) arrived in 2 periods, others have vanished. Effective pipeline is 396 units (P24, P25).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a high-demand regime sustained since Period 16 (mean demand ~174 units) and a severe reliability issue with pipeline inventory. Analysis of arrivals shows that large orders exceeding 150 units are consistently failing to arrive (Period 2, 17, 18, 19), with some now overdue by 13 periods. Total 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are in-transit but effectively lost\u2014amounts to 709 units (P2=143, P15=12, P17=155, P18=206, P19=193). The system reports 1105 in-transit units, implying the effective pipeline is only 396 units (P24=200, P25=196, P26=0). Given on-hand is 0 and recent demand is ~174, the effective pipeline (396) barely covers 2 periods of demand (348). However, the backend's 'cap' and base stock logic will be misled by the inflated 1105 in-transit figure, likely preventing new orders. To counter this and trigger an order to cover the high-demand regime, I am setting L to 1 (tightening the window to force the OR engine to prioritize short-term stock-up) and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the lost pipeline. I use an explicit mu_hat of 522 (3 periods * 174) to target a base stock high enough to overcome the ghost inventory gap, ensuring the backend realizes we are under-stocked relative to real needs.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Official In-transit (1105) contains 709 units of lost/long-tail shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective In-transit is 396 units. Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~174 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 174 units. However, we face a severe inventory crisis due to a 'Ghost Pipeline'. The system records 1,105 units in-transit, but 709 units are confirmed lost or permanently delayed (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only valid orders in the pipeline are P24 (200 units), P25 (196 units), and P26 (already arrived). This leaves an effective pipeline of 396 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Since effective pipeline (396) is less than the required base stock for a 2-3 period lead time (~520-692 units), we need the OR engine to place a large order. Because the OR engine uses the full 'In-transit' figure (1105) and current on-hand (0) to calculate the order (Order = BaseStock - (On-Hand + In-Transit)), its internal logic will result in zero orders unless we override the parameters. To force an order that compensates for the 709 lost units, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds these lost units to the target base stock. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*174 + Buffer. With L=2, Base Stock should be ~522 + buffer. To offset the 1105 in-transit visible to the backend, I will set mu_hat such that the base stock exceeds 1105. Setting mu_hat to 1350 ensures the OR engine sees a need to order additional units despite the inflated 'In-transit' number.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Massive pipeline discrepancy remains. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) = 709 units. Effective in-transit = 396 units. Demand regime remains stable at ~174/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high level since Period 16, averaging approximately 174 units per period. The last observed demand (Period 32) was 164. I will use N=16 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Regarding inventory, the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1413 units. However, based on history, 709 units are confirmed lost or severely delayed (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19). Additionally, orders from Period 24 (200 units) and Period 25 (196 units) are now 7-8 periods overdue with no arrival, suggesting they are also lost. This brings the 'ghost pipeline' total to 1105 units (709 + 200 + 196). The effective pipeline is therefore 308 (from Period 32). Lead time is highly volatile; while the average is near 2, recent large-batch delays suggest an explicit lead time of 3 is safer for buffering given current stockouts and the unreliable arrival of large orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Ghost inventory significantly increased. Orders from P24 (200 units) and P25 (196 units) are now strictly overdue (>7 periods) and likely lost, bringing total lost pipeline units to 1105. Actual available pipeline is 308 units (P32 order).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, averaging 168.4 units over the last 18 periods (P16-P33). Most recently, P33 saw a slight dip to 110 units, but this follows a long stretch of high volume. The lead time environment remains extremely bifurcated and risky. While small or targeted orders (like P32's 308 units) can arrive quickly (L=1), a massive 'ghost pipeline' of 1,105 units exists. This ghost pipeline consists of orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25. These are now between 8 and 31 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The effective in-transit inventory is currently 0, as the 308 units from P32 arrived in P33. To protect against the high demand and the unreliability of large-batch arrivals, I will set mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (N=18) and increase sigma_hat using an explicit value to account for the extreme supply-side volatility (lost shipments). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time of successful deliveries, but mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to over-order slightly to compensate for the risk of further lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) has reached 1,105 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Effective pipeline is currently 0. Demand remains in high-regime (~168 avg) since P16.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 168 units per period over the last 15 periods. Although the most recent demand (P33-P34) shows a slight dip, I will maintain the mu_hat based on the sustained higher average. The pipeline inventory currently reported by the system is 1105 units; however, historical analysis confirms that these units correspond to orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25, all of which are significantly past their promised (and observed) lead times and are considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers the required base stock (since on-hand is only 56 units), I will set the lead time 'L' to 'explicit' at 2.2 (the historical average for successful deliveries) and 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value calculated as (1 + 2.2) * 168 \u2248 538. This forces the base stock calculation to recognize the supply gap created by the lost shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 170 units per period. The recent history shows a minor dip but maintains a high average (P33: 110, P34: 142, P35: 149). The lead time remains highly volatile and bifurcated: while small or urgent orders (like P32) can arrive in 1-2 periods, a massive 'ghost pipeline' of 1,105 units is effectively lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). As of P36 start, on-hand inventory is 0. The official 'In-transit' figure of 1,105 consists entirely of these lost shipments, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 0. To trigger a new order from the OR backend, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target base stock that significantly exceeds the inflated pipeline total. With L=2 and mean demand ~170, the normal base stock would be ~510. However, because the backend subtracts the 1,105 units of ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that compensates for this: Target Base Stock (~510) + Ghost Inventory (1105) = 1615. Setting mu_hat to 1615 will force the OR engine to place an order to replenish the stock, accounting for the reality that those 1,105 units are never arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,105 units. Effective pipeline is 0. Mu_hat must be adjusted explicitly to ~1615 to overcome the backend's subtraction of these lost units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure is currently 1688 units. However, based on extensive history, 1105 units are confirmed lost from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 (none have arrived after 11+ periods). The effective pipeline consists only of the P36 order (583 units). The demand regime since P16 remains stable at approximately 161 units (last 21 periods avg: 161.4). To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers the high demand despite the presence of 1105 ghost units in its logic, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=161, and a safety factor for high demand, a target base stock of ~650 is appropriate. To bypass the backend's subtraction of 1105 ghost units, I set mu_hat = target_base_stock + total_lost_units = 650 + 1105 = 1755. This forces the system to recognize that it needs more stock despite the inflated in-transit value.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,105 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Effective pipeline is 583 units (P36). Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~161 units per period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime persists, with an average of approximately 161 units per period since Period 16. The current on-hand inventory is 472 units, following the arrival of the Period 36 order. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1243 is highly distorted by historical lost shipments. Specifically, shipments from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 1105 units) are confirmed lost or stuck in infinite lead-time tails (some overdue by 20+ periods). The 'Effective In-transit' is actually 138 units (from Period 37). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*161 + Total_Lost_Units = (1+2)*161 + 1105 = 483 + 1105 = 1588. This compensates for the 1105 units the backend will subtract from its base stock calculation which are not actually coming. Sigma_hat is set to a standard volatility for this regime (approx 30 * sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: In-transit reconciliation at Period 38: 1105 units are confirmed lost/permanent ghost inventory (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Effective pipeline is only the P37 order (138 units).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state analysis for Period 39 shows on-hand inventory at 329 units with 1,243 units in-transit. However, historical performance reveals a significant 'ghost inventory' issue: 1,105 units from orders in Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 are over 10 periods delayed and confirmed as lost. This discrepancy is critical because the OR backend's inventory balancing logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will subtract these 1,105 non-existent units, preventing necessary new orders. The true 'effective' pipeline is only 138 units (from Period 37). Demand has stabilized in a high-regime (~161 units/period) since Period 16. To compensate for the 1,105-unit ghost pipeline and maintain stock levels for a 2-period lead time (3 periods of demand coverage), mu_hat is explicitly set to include this deficit: (1+L)*Mean + Lost_Units = 3*161 + 1105 \u2248 1588. This ensures the backend places orders despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2791.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 130 units per period over the last five periods (P35-P39), down from the previous high of ~170. We must address the 'Ghost Pipeline' issue: the system reports 1332 units in-transit, but 1105 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The actual effective pipeline consists of the orders from P37 (138 units) and P39 (89 units), totaling 227 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit figure from the target base stock, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) is approximately 3 * 130 = 390 units. To ensure the backend orders correctly, we calculate: target_base_stock + ghost_inventory = 390 + 1105 = 1495. I will set mu_hat to 1495 to neutralize the phantom inventory calculation and maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Mean demand decreased from ~174 to ~130 (-25%) over the last 5 periods. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,105 units. Effective pipeline as of P40 start: 227 units (P37, P39).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system shows an In-transit balance of 1,291 units. Based on historical data, 1,105 units are confirmed lost/permanent 'ghost inventory' (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Subtracting these from the official In-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 186 units (P37: 138 units, P40: 48 units). However, the P37 order is now 4 periods old and past the typical 1-3 period arrival window, making it highly likely lost as well. If P37 is discounted, the effective pipeline is only 48 units (P40). Demand from Period 35-40 has averaged approximately 134 units, a decrease from the previous high-demand regime of ~174 units. To offset the 1,105 'ghost' units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + ghost_units. With L=2 and demand=134, Target = (3*134) + 1105 = 1507. I will use 1550 to ensure the cap does not prematurely restrict the order given the significant pipeline discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order from Period 37 (138 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, expanding the 'ghost inventory' to 1,243 units. Effective pipeline is only the Period 40 order (48 units).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1518 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this is composed of 'ghost inventory' from shipments that likely won't arrive (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P37). Specifically, 1,105 units were confirmed lost by Period 34, and the 138 units from Period 37 are now 5 periods overdue, bringing the total lost/ghost inventory to 1,243 units. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore (1518 - 1243) = 275 units (likely comprising P40=48 and P41=227). Demand remains in a high regime, averaging approximately 151 units per period over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), despite a slight dip in the mid-30s. To ensure the OR backend orders enough, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 1,243 units of ghost inventory. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~453 units). By setting mu_hat to 1696 (target 453 + ghost 1243), the backend's subtraction of 1518 units will result in an order that aligns with the true inventory state. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 1,243 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37). Effective pipeline inventory is 275 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in its high-demand regime, with the last 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging approximately 169 units. The main challenge remains a massive 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Based on the history and carry-over insights, orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P37 are confirmed lost or permanently delayed, totaling 1,243 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 1,775, but the effective pipeline only consists of recent orders from P40 (48), P41 (227), and P42 (257), totaling 532 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 1,243 units of ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the required base stock (assuming L=2) for a ~95% service level with mean ~169 and std ~20: Base Stock \u2248 (1+2)*169 + 1.645*sqrt(3)*20 \u2248 564. Adding the 1,243 ghost units to this targets a mu_hat that forces the engine to place an order despite the inflated pipeline count. I will set mu_hat to 1,807 (564 + 1,243) and keep sigma_hat at recent levels to maintain sensitivity to variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,243 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37). Effective lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, but recent large orders (P41, P42) are still within the promised window. Demand mean is stable at ~169 units since P38.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, the system reports an In-transit total of 1818 units. However, based on tracking historical performance, 1243 of these units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost or permanently delayed shipments from periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 37). The effective pipeline actually consists of the orders from P41 (227 units), P42 (257 units), and P43 (91 units), totaling 575 units. Demand since Period 38 has stabilized in a high regime with a mean of approximately 169 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 and high service level (~170 units/period * 3 periods + safety stock) needs to be shifted by the ghost inventory amount (1243 units). I will use 'mu_hat' to signal a massive demand across the review+lead period (effective_target + 1243). This ensures the order placed (Base Stock - Pipeline) remains positive and reflective of actual needs. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility in arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: In-transit integrity check confirms 1,243 units are lost/ghost inventory. Effective pipeline is 575 units. Demand remains stable in the high regime (~169 units) observed since Period 38.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in a high-demand regime, averaging ~169 units over the last 7 periods (P38-P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 94 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1682 units; however, historical analysis confirms a massive 'ghost pipeline' of 1,243 units (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P37) that are significantly overdue and considered lost. The effective pipeline inventory actually consists only of orders from Period 42 (257 units), Period 43 (91 units), and Period 44 (91 units), totaling 439 units. To compensate for the 1,243 lost units being incorrectly subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend, I must inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand is ~169. Target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) is approximately 169 * 3 = 507. To achieve an order that accounts for the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 507 + 1243 = 1750. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 1,243 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37). Effective pipeline is currently 439 units (P42-P44). Demand regime is stable at ~169 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3258.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the high-demand regime established around Period 16, with a recent 10-period mean (P36-P45) of approximately 166 units per period. The supply chain continues to face a significant 'ghost inventory' issue where 1,243 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37) are confirmed lost or permanently delayed (10+ periods or strictly overdue past the maximum observed lead time of 3). The current In-transit of 1370 contains these 1,243 ghost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 127 units (P44 order of 91 and P45 order of 36). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting the ghost units from the target inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = Mean Demand * (L+1) + safety stock. With L=2 and Mean=166, base target is ~500. However, the backend will subtract the 1,370 in-transit units. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Target + Ghost Inventory) = 500 + 1243 = 1743 to trigger a sufficient order. I choose 1750 as the mu_hat value to ensure service levels are maintained despite the inflated pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: In-transit Integrity: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,243 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37). Effective lead time is currently 3 periods for recent arrivals (P41, P42).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2443.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47, there is a cumulative 'ghost pipeline' of 1243 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37) that are permanently lost or long-tail delayed. The official In-transit figure of 1580 units includes these ghost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 337 units (P44=91, P45=36, P46=210). Recent arrivals (P41-P43) confirmed actual lead times of 2-3 periods. Demand from P38-P46 is relatively stable with a mean of ~163 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon despite the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock; with L=2, demand=163, and z*~1.9 for 95% service level, the base stock should be ~650. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 1580 in-transit units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1600. This value, when combined with the 122 on-hand units and subtracted by the 1580 in-transit units, will result in the backend targeting approximately the desired safety levels without being paralyzed by the lost shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reflects an in-transit inventory of 1580 units. However, based on extensive historical tracking, 1243 of these units (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P37) are confirmed lost or stuck in a long-tail delay (>10 periods). The effective pipeline is actually 337 units (P44=91, P45=36, P46=210). To compensate for the 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the base stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that bridges this gap. The target inventory level is (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=3 (recent performance), mean demand ~165, and the need to offset 1243 lost units, the calculated mu_hat is ((3+1)*165) + 1243 \u2248 1903. This ensures the OR backend places an order that accounts for the current stockout and the fact that most 'in-transit' units will never arrive. Demand remains in a high regime (last 10 periods average ~163).

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Ghost inventory remains at 1243 units. Effective pipeline: 337 units. Demand regime stable at ~163 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 49, the demand regime continues at a high level, averaging 162 units over the last 10 periods (P39-P48). In-transit reconciliation remains the primary challenge: the official 'In-transit' of 1968 units is significantly inflated by lost or permanently delayed shipments from Period 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 37. Total confirmed ghost inventory equals 1243 units. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P44 (91 units), P45 (36 units), P46 (210 units), and P48 (388 units), totaling 725 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1968 units from its base_stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 1243 lost units. To maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review=1), I target a base stock of roughly 3 periods of demand (3 * 162 = 486). To force an order that accounts for the ghost inventory, mu_hat is set to roughly (Base Stock Target + Ghost Inventory) = 486 + 1243 = 1729. This ensures the system doesn't under-order due to the faulty in-transit data.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge where 1,243 units are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or permanently delayed (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P37). These lost units cause the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Demand since Period 16 has been in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 165 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (Total cycle = 3 periods), the required inventory baseline is roughly 495 units (3 * 165). However, the system currently shows 1,968 units in-transit. Subtracting the 1,243 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 725 units (Orders P44, P45, P46, P48). Since 725 is already above the required 495, the OR engine would normally order 0. To ensure the engine maintains the necessary flow despite the inflated in-transit figure, I set mu_hat explicitly to the current 'In-transit' plus one period of demand (1968 + 165 = 2133). This forces the base stock calculation to recognize the ghost inventory while targeting a net order that replenishes current consumption. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (approx 2.2) rather than the promised 2.
