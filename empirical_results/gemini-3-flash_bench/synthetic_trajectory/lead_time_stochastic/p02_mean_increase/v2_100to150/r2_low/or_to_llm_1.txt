The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, the demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided in system instructions) was: 110, 116, 74, 101, and 85, resulting in an average of 97.2 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 126 units. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the base-stock policy targets the median demand. A lead time of 2 periods means we must cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time duration (P2, P3), as an order placed now arrives in P3's arrival phase for use in P4. However, to prevent immediate stockouts since we start at zero, we must initiate the pipeline immediately. The OR's 126 units is a reasonable starting point to build inventory for the mean demand while accounting for variance. I will follow the OR recommendation as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or demand regime shifts.",

Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (126 units) hasn't arrived yet, which is expected given the promised lead time of 2 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 156, exceeding the historical mean. The OR recommendation is 155 units, based on its calculated base-stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302). Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, leading to a safety factor (z*) of 0. My goal is to ensure Pipeline Inventory (On-hand + In-transit) covers demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Historical samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) suggest an average demand of ~97.2 units/period. Over 3 periods, expected demand is ~292 units. Our current pipeline is 126 units (from Period 1). Total required minus current pipeline is 292 - 126 = 166 units. The OR recommendation of 155 is slightly more conservative but reasonable given the cap. However, Period 1 demand (156) was significantly higher than the average. To avoid stockouts while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0), I will stick close to the OR recommendation but round up slightly to 160 to account for the recent demand spike, ensuring we build the pipeline for the 2-period lead time wait.",

However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand to minimize total cost. \n5. Strategy: A pipeline of 286 units covers approximately 2.6 periods of average demand (108 units/period).

OR recommends 10 units based on a tight cap and its standard base-stock calculation. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as stockouts.

P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered in Period 2) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived by the start of Period 5 if L=2, or Period 6 if L=3). Given P1 took 3 periods, P2 is officially late. This suggests a high risk of 'lost' or significantly delayed shipments. \nDemand Analysis: Demand has fluctuated (156, 117, 90, 77, 94) with an average of approximately 107 units per period. \nOR Recommendation: The OR recommends 86 units based on a lead time of 2. However, with the pipeline (220) potentially containing a lost shipment (160 from P2) and current on-hand at 0, we are at high risk of stockouts. If we treat the 160 units as lost/delayed, the effective pipeline is only 60 units (P4+P5). \nFinal Strategy: To cover demand for the next 3 periods (current + L=2) while accounting for the likely loss of the Period 2 order, I will increase the order quantity. Average demand ~110 * 3 = 330 units. Subtracting the reliable pipeline (60 units) leaves a need for 270.

To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~310 units), we have 76 (on-hand) + 130 (reliable in-transit) = 206. We need approximately 104 more units to maintain service levels.

The in-transit pipeline is 480 units, consisting of orders from P15 (110 units), P17 (80 units, which arrived early in P17 per the conclude msg), and the new P17 order of 80 units? Wait, looking at P17 conclude: arrived=150 (P14) and 80 (P16). This means P15 (110) and P17 (80) are current pipeline. Total pipeline is 110 + 80 + 80 (placed in P17) = 270. User interface says in-transit is 480, which likely includes the lost P2 and P6 orders. Subtracting lost units (480 - 160 - 130 = 190), the functional pipeline is 190. 3. **Demand & OR**: Average demand is ~104 units.

Additionally, prior lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6) account for 290 units, leaving 520 units likely in active transit. The OR recommendation of 0 units is driven by the fact that the total pipeline (810 units) far exceeds any reasonable base-stock level calculated from historical demand (even including the Period 19 spike of 238). Although the recent demand spike in Period 19 suggested a regime shift, Period 20 demand returned to a more normal level (94). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand. Over-ordering now, while having over 500 units in the pipeline and 0 on-hand, would likely lead to excessive holding costs once the 'logjam' of transit orders clears.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile, with a spike in P19 (238) and subsequent demand around 94-136. The average demand remains approximately 105-110 units. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because the 'In-transit' figure (810) is massive compared to the base stock. However, much of this pipeline is likely lost or significantly delayed.

Based on historical tracking and carry-over insights, the following orders are confirmed lost: P2 (160), P6 (130), P15 (110), P17 (80), P18 (100), P19 (100). This totals 680 lost units. Additionally, orders from P21 (0), P24 (60 - now overdue at L=4), P25 (150 - now overdue at L=3) are highly suspect. The active pipeline likely consists only of P27 (150) and P28 (140). Excluding the lost 680 units, the functional pipeline is 500 units.\n3. Demand Analysis: A structural shift occurred around Period 23. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 134 units/period, compared to the early-game average of ~108. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the raw 'In-transit' figure of 1180, which is heavily inflated by dead/lost orders. To cover a 3-period window (L+1) at the new demand mean (~134 * 3 = 402 units), we need more than just the current 134 on-hand units, especially given that P24 (60) and P25 (150) are increasingly likely to be lost.

A 3-period coverage requirement (P47, P48, P49) at the current demand rate is ~432 units. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because its mathematical model sees the 1,908 units as valid pipeline inventory. I will override this to 0 because the 450 units in the active pipeline (ordered P44-P46) plus my 18 on-hand units satisfy the safety stock and demand requirements for the immediate horizon, as these orders should arrive in P47, P48, and P49 based on recent 2-3 period lead-time performance.",

The P44 order (ordered 4 periods ago) should ideally arrive now despite previous delays. To cover demand for the final 3 periods (approx. 450 total units), we need to ensure enough stock arrives.
