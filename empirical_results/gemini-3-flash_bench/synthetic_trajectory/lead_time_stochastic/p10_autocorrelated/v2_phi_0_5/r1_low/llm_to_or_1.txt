Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 116 units and a standard deviation of 25.4. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since total lead time for demand coverage is L+1 = 3, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 historical samples to establish a baseline. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, which the backend will handle. Because there is no inventory on-hand or in-transit, the OR engine will trigger an initial order to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 158 units with a promised lead time of L=2. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that 0 units arrived and we had 131 units of demand, which we could not satisfy (sold=0) due to 0 starting inventory. This demand of 131 is within the range of the provided historical samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111). The current pipeline inventory is 158 units. Since no orders have concluded arrival yet, we cannot infer a deviation in lead time from the promised L=2. I will use the recent N samples to forecast demand and setting L to default.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (pre-game samples) and 131, 64 in the first two concluded periods. The average demand across these 7 samples is approximately 110.7. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (158 units) and Period 2 (145 units) are currently in-transit (total 303 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2. Since we haven't seen a concluded arrival yet, we stick to the promised lead time (L=2) and use a recent window (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean more accurately than the full history, as demand appears slightly higher than the initial sample mean of 110.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (158 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and been visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude, which means the P1 order is delayed. Since the P1 order has not arrived by the start of Period 4, the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. I will set the lead time (L) explicitly to 3 to reflect this observed delay. The historical demand samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show an average of roughly 116. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std will capture this level and volatility across the extended lead time (+1 review period). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, while still pushing for enough stock to cover the transit time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) exceeds promised 2 periods (Period 1 order did not conclude by Period 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-53.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first completed shipments for 'chips(Regular)'. The P1 order arrived after 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived after only 1 period. This suggests lead time variability (average ~2 periods, but inconsistent). The carry-over insight regarding lost/long lead time for P1 is now resolved as it arrived in P4. Total history shows 5 demand samples [75, 138, 134, 122, 111] (Note: The user-provided list differs slightly from the game history demand, I will prioritize the provided sample list for statistical calculations as it appears to be the gold standard for the 'mu_hat' logic). Demand mean is ~116 with a std dev of ~25. Since L matches the promised 2 periods on average, I will use 'default' for L. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history. This balances the service level against the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on historical demand (P1: 75, P2: 138, P3: 134, P4: 122, P5: 111 - note: the game history section shows slightly different realized demand values: P1:131, P2:64, P3:99, P4:70, P5:69), the average demand is roughly 86.6. Lead time observation: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised L=2 seems volatile. Currently, we have 54 on-hand and 229 in-transit (P2 order of 145 and P4 order of 84). The P2 order (placed in P2) is now overdue if L=3 (expected arrival P5, visible P6). Since P5 conclude shows 0 arrivals, the P2 order is significantly delayed or potentially lost. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end delay seen. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all realized demand samples (approx 86.6) scaled by (1+L=4), totaling ~346. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of all samples adjusted for the lead time duration to maintain service levels despite supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 L=3, P3 L=1. P2 order (145 units) is overdue as of Period 6 (placed Period 2, L=2/3 exceeded).

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 352 units in-transit. Historical performance shows high lead time volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and importantly, the Period 2 order (145 units) is now 2 periods overdue (5 periods since ordering, where promised was 2). This missing shipment has caused a stockout in Period 6 (sold only 54 out of 127 demand). Demand has averaged 98.7 units over 6 periods. Given the high probability that the Period 2 order is lost or severely delayed, I must adjust the lead time 'L' to 3 to reflect the worst-case observed actual lead time and ensure the base stock covers a longer 'review + lead time' window. I will use 'recent_N' (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the full range of recent demand fluctuations while adjusting L to 3. This increases the safety stock and base inventory levels to compensate for the unreliability of the supply chain demonstrated in the first 6 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (145 units) is likely lost; no arrival after 5 periods (Promised L=2). Supply chain remains highly unstable with observed lead times ranging from 1 to 3+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand history shows a mean of approximately 98 units (samples: 131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124). Recent demand (last 2 periods) has spiked significantly to 125.5, indicating a potential regime shift or high volatility. On-hand inventory is 0. In terms of lead time, we have observed L=3 (twice) and L=1 (once). The Period 2 order (145 units) is now 5 periods late and is considered lost. The Period 6 order (123 units) and Period 7 order (22 units) are in transit. With an observed average lead time of approx 2.33 periods and high variability, I will set L to 3 to be conservative and protect against stockouts, especially given the recent high demand. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand levels. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value based on the high variance observed (std of recent samples is approx 30, so sqrt(1+3)*30 = 60).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started Period 6: avg demand increased from ~86 to ~125 (+45%). Lead time instability persists: observed range [1, 3] periods with one lost shipment from Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 6, with demand over the last three periods (P6-P8) averaging 134.33 units, compared to the earlier average of approximately 86 units. Lead times remain highly unstable, with observed actuals of 3, 1, 3, and 1 periods, plus one likely lost shipment from Period 2. The pipeline currently contains 123 units (ordered P6), 102 units (ordered P8), and 145 units from P2 which is likely lost. Excluding the lost P2 shipment, adjusted pipeline inventory is 225 units. I will set L to the 'calculate' method to capture the average actual lead time (2.0) and use 'recent_3' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the elevated demand and lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: mean increased from ~86 to 134 (+55%) over last 3 periods. In-transit shipment from Period 2 (145 units) is now declared lost (7 periods elapsed, promised L=2).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted significantly from an initial average of ~86 to ~142 over the last 4 periods (P6-P9: 127, 124, 152, 165). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Lead times are extremely volatile, with observed values of 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1 periods, plus a lost shipment from Period 2. The average of observed lead times (3+1+3+1+1)/5 is 1.8 periods. Given the instability and the impact of the lost shipment, I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average known lead times while the OR logic considers the pipeline. In-transit inventory stands at 402 (from Period 6 and Period 9), which should cover upcoming demand, but due to stockouts in the last 4 periods, I must ensure base stock levels are high enough to account for the increased variance and mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 sustained: 4-period average increased to 142 units (+65%) with high volatility (std ~20).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the average demand is 144 units, confirming a significant shift from the initial baseline (~86). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 497 units in transit. Lead times are extremely volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (P2). To stabilize, I am setting L=2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat based on the new demand regime (last 5 periods). The backend logic for base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)) because holding cost equals profit. However, since we are currently out of stock and pipeline inventory is high (497), the OR backend will likely order a smaller amount or nothing to prevent overshooting under the capped policy. Using N=5 for both mean and standard deviation captures the current higher-volume, higher-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 sustained: 5-period average (P6-P10) is 144 units (+67% vs early baseline) with high volatility (std ~15-20). Lead time remains unreliable (range [1, 3]).

Historic lead times have been highly volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1, P8=1), with one order (P2) confirmed lost. Effectively, the promised lead time of 2 is an average, but the distribution is bi-modal. I will set L to 2 (promised/average) but must account for the demand regime shift that began in Period 6. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is (124+152+165+152+85)/5 = 135.6, which aligns with previous carry-over insights of a significant shift (~140). However, Period 11 saw a dip to 85. I'll use recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher-demand regime (P6-P11 average: (127+124+152+165+152+85)/6 = 134.1) while maintaining a buffer for the high variance observed lately (std is elevated). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate. Given the high in-transit amount (497) relative to the expected base stock (~134 * 3 = 402), the OR engine will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the massive pipeline awaiting arrival.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, we saw the arrival of Period 9 and Period 10 orders (lead times 3 and 2 respectively). The current situation shows a demand regime shift that began at Period 6. From Period 6 to Period 12, demand has been higher and more volatile (average ~130, standard deviation ~30). Specifically, Periods 6-10 saw demand over 120, while Periods 11-12 saw a slight dip (85 and 97). However, given the supply chain instability (lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and a lost order from Period 2), I must maintain a robust safety stock. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 268 units plus 132 on-hand (total 400) covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the higher mean. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent demand data from Period 6 onwards (N=7) to capture the higher mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the observed higher demand regime and the risk of lead time fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6-12 averages 130 units (+50% vs early baseline) with high volatility (std ~30). Lead times remain inconsistent, ranging between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting Around Period 6. Recent demand (P6-P13) has averaged approximately 125 units, though volatility has increased significantly (estimated std ~30). The most recent two periods (P12-P13) show a slight cooling of demand (97 and 95), suggesting the mean might be stabilizing around 110-120. Lead times are highly unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and one lost shipment (Period 2). Given the instability, I will use an explicit lead time of 2.5 periods (averaging the range) to ensure the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime since Period 6, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the most recent volatility observed during the high/fluctuating period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6-13 averages 125 units (+43% vs early baseline). Lead times are unstable (range 1-3 periods). Permanent loss of Period 2 shipment confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 6 has stabilized into a higher mean than the initial 5 periods, though it has cooled slightly from its peak (Period 15 context: demand was 96 in P14). The average demand from P6 to P14 is approximately 121 units. Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment from P2. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are facing stockouts, I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum lead time) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum likely delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the average since the regime shift at Period 6. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the high volatility (std approx 30) observed since the demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6-14 (last 9 periods) averages 121 units, stabilizing after the initial spike. Lead time volatility persists with a range of [1, 3] periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 6, averaging approximately 121 units over the last 9 periods (P6-P14). Period 15 demand was 124 units, confirming this level. Lead times remain unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and one lost shipment from Period 2. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 486 units in transit (representing orders from P14 and P15, and the legacy lost P2 order). Since the pipeline inventory includes the lost 145 units from Period 2, which will likely never arrive, I must set the lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect the late-arriving reality and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the supply fragility. I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately (P6-P15), which averages ~121.5 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (10) to reflect the moderately high volatility observed in this demand regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 6) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the early periods. Calculating the average demand from Period 6 to Period 16 (last 11 periods) results in 124.3 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 25 units. Regarding lead times, the observed values are 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods (average 2). However, the Period 2 order is confirmed lost. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 487 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 14, 15, and 16). Given that these orders are still within the observed lead time window of 1-3 periods, no new losses are suspected yet, but the supply is erratic. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (Period 6-16) to reflect the current regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the increased volatility (std ~25). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6-8, moving from an early baseline of ~86 to an average of ~120-130 units. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has been 95, 96, 124, 141, and 169 (Mean = 125, Std ~31). Since P15-P17 show a rising trend (124 -> 169), I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility. The lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. Using the 'calculate' method for L allows the backend to derive an average from all successfully concluded lead times (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2, P14:3, P16:1), which currently averages ~2.0, correctly reflecting the promised L=2 while accounting for the high variance. On-hand is 0, but in-transit is high (354 units, including an 86-unit order from P15 and the P14/P16 arrivals that just settled). Our parameters need to account for the current demand spike and erratic supply arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: last 3 periods (P15-P17) show a steep upward trend (124, 141, 169) compared to the P6-P14 average of ~120.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0 and demand is volatile. Looking at the history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 6. Recently, from Period 15-18, demand has trended even higher (124, 141, 169, 146), with a 4-period average of 145 units. I will set mu_hat based on this recent high-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock is responsive to the current trend. Lead times continue to be highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P14 arrived in 3, P16 arrived in 1). I will set L to 2 (recent_N=5) as a compromise, noting that the Period 2 order of 145 units is definitively lost and should no longer be counted in active pipeline decisions by the OR backend. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility (std ~18) observed in the latest demand spike, ensuring a higher service level during this period of replenishment uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified further starting Period 15: 4-period average (P15-P18) is 145 units, significantly higher than the previous P6-P14 average (~121). Lead time variability remains high [1, 3].

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory and 464 units in-transit. A significantly higher demand regime emerged around Period 15, with the last 5 periods (P15-P19) averaging 139.8 units, compared to the earlier baseline. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods with confirmed lost orders (P2). To calculate parameters, I am using a recent window of N=5 to capture the most recent demand intensification (\u03bc ~ 140). The average lead time observed in the history is approximately 2.1 periods, but given the frequency of 3-period arrivals and the risk of stockouts during high demand, I will set L to 2 (promised) while using the recent demand volatility (\u03c3) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the current in-transit pipeline. The critical goal is to recover from the stockout as the 464 units in-transit (ordered P15, P16, P18, P19) begin to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: 5-period average (P15-P19) is 140 units (+15% vs P6-P14 average). Lead time remains erratic but averages ~2.1 periods across all successful deliveries.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 464 units in-transit. A demand regime shift was confirmed starting at Period 15, with the last 6 periods (P15-P20) averaging 136 units (ranging from 118 to 169). Although there was a peak around P17, the last three periods have cooled slightly (146, 119, 118). I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to account for this higher stabilized demand compared to the earlier periods. Lead times remain unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.1). Orders from P15 (86 units), P18 (53 units), and P19 (57 units) are currently undelivered. Given the stockout situation since Period 18, the OR engine needs to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current pipeline and lead time variability. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average performance and sigma_hat to recent_6 to capture the increased volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 15 stabilized at an average of ~136 units (P15-P20), higher than the P6-P14 average of ~121. Lead time remains erratic but averages ~2.1 periods based on successful deliveries (range [1, 3]).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand and 464 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. The mean lead time of successful deliveries is approximately 2.1 periods. Demand has shown several shifts; most recently, from Period 15, the average hovered around 130-140, though the last two periods (P20, P21) saw a dip to 118 and 78. Given the current stockout and the high pipeline (464 units already in transit), the OR backend needs to account for the actual observed lead time rather than the promised 2 periods to avoid over-ordering while ensuring future arrivals cover the demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the observed average (approx 2.1) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 (covering P15-P21) to capture the current demand regime and its recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 remains active: 7-period average (P15-P21) is 127 units with significant volatility. Supply chain instability confirmed with actual lead times observed at [1, 2, 3] periods and one permanent loss (Period 2).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and no arrivals for the last 5 periods (P18-P22). Despite an in-transit balance of 464 units, recent history shows multiple orders from Periods 15, 18, and 19 have not arrived, suggesting either an extended lead-time shift or lost shipments. Demand has also shifted; after a spike near Period 15, the last 3 periods (P20-P22) have softened to 118, 78, and 94 units (mean ~97). However, the overall regime since Period 15 (P15-P22) averages 124 units. Due to the high uncertainty in supply (observed lead times 1-3, plus potential losses), I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time. I'll set N=8 for demand to capture the regime starting at Period 15, and use recent_N for L to adapt to the clearly unstable delivery performance. The OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to protect against the high volatility and service level requirements (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% critical fractile, but the cap logic uses 95% for safety).

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival gap: No shipments arrived between Periods 18 and 22 inclusive, while 464 units remain in-transit. Demand since Period 15 averages 124 units with high volatility, though recent 3-period demand (P20-P22) cooled to ~97.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply chain crisis with zero on-hand inventory and 464 units in-transit that have failed to arrive for many periods. Specifically, orders from Periods 15, 18, and 19 (totaling 196 units) are now beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, suggesting they may be delayed or lost. No shipments have arrived since Period 17, resulting in 6 consecutive periods of total stockouts. Although recent demand (P21-P23) has cooled to an average of ~92 units compared to the higher P15-P20 average of ~136, the priority is to resume supply while accounting for high lead time uncertainty. I will set L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=9 (covering P15-P23) to capture the higher volatility regime starting at P15, which averages ~116 units per period. This provides a target base stock of (1+L)*116 = 464. Since in-transit (464) matches this target, the capped OR policy will likely suppress new orders unless we increase parameters. I will maintain these settings to avoid over-ordering given the massive pipeline, but I acknowledge that if current in-transit units are lost, we will remain stocked out.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival blackout: No units arrived between Period 18 and Period 23. Combined with zero on-hand inventory, this indicates massive stockouts. 464 units are in-transit, but several (P15, P18, P19) are overdue.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently experiencing a severe failure, with no shipments arriving since Period 17 (a 7-period blackout). On-hand inventory is 0, and 486 units are in-transit, including significantly overdue orders from Period 15 (L=10+), Period 18 (L=7+), and Period 19 (L=6+). Given the promised L=2, these older shipments are increasingly likely to be lost. Recent demand (P20-P24) has stabilized lower, averaging ~95 units compared to the previous peak of 145. To address the massive stockouts caused by the arrival blackout while accounting for the high probability of lost in-transit inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of previously successful lead times) to increase the pipeline target. I will use the last 10 periods (P15-P24) for demand (mu_hat) to capture both the peak and the recent cooling, averaging ~117 units. Sigma_hat is set based on the last 10 periods to reflect high delivery uncertainty and recent demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged shipment blackout: No arrivals between Periods 18 and 24 inclusive (7 periods), despite 486 units in-transit. Shipments from P15, P18, and P19 are now critically overdue and likely lost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a critical supply chain failure state. No shipments have arrived since Period 17, representing an 8-period blackout. Current in-transit inventory is 486 units, but shipments from Periods 15 (86 units), 18 (53 units), 19 (57 units), and 6 (123 units) are significantly overdue based on the promised lead time of 2 and the previously observed maximum of 3. These 319 units are highly likely lost. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock calculation; if the pipeline is inflated by lost orders, it will not place new orders despite zero stock. To force the OR engine to resume ordering and account for these losses, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculation mu_hat as (1+L) * forecast. Demand has cooled recently, averaging 92.8 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3 * 93 = 279. By setting mu_hat = 279 + 319 (lost units) = 598, I effectively 'cancel out' the ghost inventory in the pipeline, forcing the backend to try and replenish. Setting L to 'explicit' 3 reflects the actual observed upper bound of the supply chain when it functions.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25) with zero arrivals despite 486 units in-transit. Shipments from P6, P15, P18, and P19 (totaling 319 units) are now considered lost due to excessive lead time (>6 periods).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of catastrophe. There have been zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26), despite a massive pipeline of 598 units. Historical evidence and carry-over insights confirm that shipments from Periods 6 (123 units), 15 (86 units), 18 (53 units), and 19 (57 units) are extremely likely to be lost given they are 7 to 20 periods overdue. The OR backend's capped policy relies on pipeline_inventory ('In-transit'), which currently includes these lost units, preventing it from ordering enough to meet demand once the 'blackout' ends. To force the backend to place replacement orders, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 6. This reflects the reality that if a shipment doesn't arrive within 6 periods in this environment, it is likely lost. Demand has stabilized somewhat from its extreme volatility, averaging ~100 units over the last 7 periods (P20-P26). I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly cooled demand regime while maintaining a high safety stock for when arrivals finally resume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26) with zero arrivals. Total confirmed lost/critically overdue units: 123 (P6), 86 (P15), 53 (P18), 57 (P19), totaling 319 units. Effective in-transit pipeline is significantly lower than the system's recorded 598 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of collapse with zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27). While the system reports 698 units in-transit, I have identified a significant portion of this as lost or critically overdue. Lost units include those from Period 2 (145), Period 6 (123), Period 15 (86), Period 18 (53), and Period 19 (57), totaling 464 units. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore ~234 units (698 minus 464). Demand has stabilized since Period 21 at an average of ~110 units per period. To signal the OR backend to place orders despite the large (but ghost) in-transit volume, I am setting L to an explicit value of 6. This reflects the reality that if an order does arrive, it is taking much longer than 2 periods, and it increases the base stock target (1+L)*mu higher than the current reported pipeline, which should trigger new orders to compensate for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units increased to 464 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) due to 10+ periods of zero arrivals. Reported in-transit units are mostly 'ghost' inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has finally resumed arrivals after a 10-period blackout, with 112 units arriving in Period 28 (ordered Period 26, lead_time=2). This confirms that orders placed from Period 26 onwards are likely viable, whereas orders placed between Periods 15 and 19 (totaling 250 units) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory as they are more than 10 periods overdue. The current in-transit visibility is 605, but subtracting the confirmed lost units (P2: 145, P6: 123, P15: 86, P18: 53, P19: 57 = 464 units) leaves an effective pipeline of 141 units (P27: 100, P24: 22, P28: 19). Demand has spiked again to 150 units. To rebuild inventory and compensate for the OR backend's inability to see 'lost' pipeline inventory, I am using an explicit L=6 to force a higher base stock, ensuring the order covers the high demand (avg ~140 recently) while effectively ignoring the ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in Period 28 with a 2-period lead time arrival (Order P26). Cumulative lost inventory confirmed at 464 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Demand remains high (P27-28 average 143.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with two consecutive arrivals (Period 28 and 29) both arriving with a lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (668 units) consists of known lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 (totaling 464 units). The effective pipeline is therefore only 204 units (from Orders 24, 28, and 29). Demand has remained elevated, with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging 125 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is outstripping effective arrivals, I am setting mu_hat to 390 (130 * 3) to reflect the recent demand level across the lead time + review period. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to account for high volatility. I am using an explicit lead time of 2 periods to match the most recent reliable arrival data, while the OR backend will calculate the order based on the inflated in-transit figure, necessitate a higher base stock parameter to trigger replenishment despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P26 and P27 orders arrived with L=2. Total confirmed lost units remain at 464 (P2: 145, P6: 123, P15: 86, P18: 53, P19: 57). Effective in-transit is current reported in-transit minus 464.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized over the last three periods (P28-P30) with a consistent lead time of 2 periods, following a massive disruption. However, 464 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the system's 'In-transit' count of 649 to determine the true pipeline (649 - 464 = 185 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P27-P30) averages 124 units. To maintain a safe stock level given the 2-period lead time, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P26-P30) where demand averaged ~122.4 units, and sigma_hat similarly to capture the current volatility. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its calculation, and the backend cannot 'see' lost orders, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that is high enough to account for the 'ghost' inventory reported by the system until those lost orders are potentially phased out or the target is met.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Last 3 orders (P26, P27, P28) arrived with L=2. Total confirmed lost units remain 464, creating a persistent inflation of the system's in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P28-P31) with the most recent three observed lead times consistently at 2 periods (Orders P26, P27, P28). Therefore, L is set to 'default' (2 periods). System-wide inventory reporting ('In-transit: 649') remains heavily inflated by 464 confirmed lost units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). The effective in-transit pipeline is actually 185 units (649 - 464), all of which were ordered recently (P29 ordered 163, P30 ordered 0, P31 ordered 0). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand from Period 26-31 shows a mean of 121 and standard deviation of 20. To compensate for the 'ghost' in-transit units and ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 121 = 363). To force the backend to place an order despite the 464 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 363 + 464 = 827. Sigma_hat is set to 35 (sqrt(3)*20) using 'explicit' to ensure adequate safety stock during this recovery phase.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from P26, P27, and P28 all arriving exactly on time (L=2). However, a significant accounting discrepancy persists: the system reports 827 units in-transit, but 464 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that have not arrived after 13+ periods. The effective pipeline is actually 363 units (827 - 464). Demand has reached a new high-volatility regime, with the most recent 6 periods (P27-P32) averaging 120 units. I am setting L to 2 (promised/recent actual), and mu_hat to an explicit value calculated as (L+1) * 125 = 375, which accounts for the current demand mean and ensures the base stock calculation targets the correct period coverage. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a buffer for the observed high demand variance (std ~23 over recent periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized over the last few periods (P26-P32) with lead times of 1-2 periods, although 464 units from earlier periods (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and remain as 'ghost' inventory in the system's pipeline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 62 and the reported in-transit is 649. Subtracting the 464 lost units gives an effective in-transit of 185 (which corresponds to the P29 order of 163 and the P24 order of 22). Demand has stayed relatively high, with the last 7 periods (P27-P33) averaging 119.4 units and the last 3 periods (P31-P33) averaging 113.3. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on a recent 7-period window (P27-P33) to capture this current regime, using N=7. For lead time, while recent arrivals were L=1 or L=2, the history shows significant volatility; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average of successful arrivals. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the high volatility observed during the recovery phase.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1-2 periods over the most recent cycles (P32-P34). However, there is a massive discrepancy between total recorded in-transit units (649) and effective in-transit units. Based on historical analysis, 464 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Additionally, the order from P24 (22 units) and P29 (163 units) have not arrived within the typical 2-period window, suggesting they may also be delayed or lost. Subtracting the confirmed lost units (464) from the reported in-transit (649) leaves 185 units 'effectively' in-transit, which matches the sum of the P29 order (163) and P24 order (22). Since the order from P29 is only 1 period late (L=3 window), I will treat it as potentially arriving soon, but the 464 units must be compensated for by using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated pipeline. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 115 over the last 10 periods. To maintain service levels given zero on-hand inventory and a 28-unit deficit (Demand 115 - 185 effective in-transit over L+1 periods), I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the correction for lost inventory transparency.

Carry-over insight: Current reported in-transit (649) contains 464 confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is only 185 units (P24, P29). Lead time has stabilized to 1-2 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has partially stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods, although 464 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and remain as 'ghost' inventory in the system's in-transit count. The current system reported in-transit is 811, but the effective in-transit pipeline is only 347 (811 - 464). These 347 units are orders from P24 (22), P29 (163), and P35 (162). Demand has recently softened but remains volatile; the 10-period average (P26-P35) is approximately 114 units. To ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated 'ghost' in-transit figures, I will use 'explicit' methods to set lead time at 2 periods and mu_hat based on the 10-period demand average (114 * (1+2) = 342). Setting mu_hat to 342 will signal to the OR engine that the effective inventory is insufficient to cover the lead-time demand, even without manually subtracting the ghost inventory (since 811 is vastly greater than 342, the backend might order nothing unless mu_hat is sufficiently high to trigger a replenishment or the pipeline is corrected). However, because the backend logic 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' is strictly applied, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 464 units of lost stock. Effective target base stock should be (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units = (114 * 3) + 464 = 806. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this 'ghost' inventory to maintain a healthy arrival stream.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. The primary challenge continues to be a heavily distorted 'In-transit' figure of 850 units. Based on historical tracking, 464 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Additionally, orders from P24 (22 units) and P29 (163 units) are now critically overdue (13 and 8 periods respectively since ordering, against a stable L=1-2 for recent successful arrivals), raising the likely lost total to 649 units. The effective pipeline consists only of P32 (arrived P33), P35 (162 units, expected P37), and P36 (39 units, expected P38). Recent demand (P31-P36) has cooled from the earlier spike, averaging ~100 units/period (114, 110, 116, 95, 85, 83). To calculate mu_hat, I'll use a recent N=6 (P31-P36) to capture this cooling trend. For the lead time L, I'll stick with default (2) as recent performance fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods, but I will provide an explicit L and mu_hat to ensure the backend base stock logic accounts for the current demand regime. With On-hand at 0 and effective pipeline at ~201 units (P35 + P36), the OR engine needs to order to reach the target base stock based on the real pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost inventory updated to 649 units: P2(145), P6(123), P15(86), P18(53), P19(57), P24(22), P29(163). Reported in-transit (850) is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' units. Effective pipeline is only ~201 units. Demand has cooled from ~140 to ~100 units over the last 6 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (P32 L=1, P35 L=2, P36 L=1). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (649) is heavily inflated by 649 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 29 which never arrived. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero as of the start of Period 38. Demand has cooled from the earlier high of 140+ to approximately 100 units over the last 8 periods (average P30-P37 is 101.5). I will set L to 2 to cover the promised lead time and observed volatility. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~100 units. To compensate for the 649 'ghost' units in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, I will provide a heavily inflated mu_hat (target base stock) using the explicit method. Target base stock = (L+1) * 100 + Safety Stock. With L=2, target is 300 + ~50. To offset the -649 in-transit subtraction the backend will perform, I will set mu_hat to approximately 1000 to ensure an order is actually placed.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost inventory reached 649 units as of Period 37: P2(145), P6(123), P15(86), P18(53), P19(57), P24(22), P29(163). Demand since Period 30 has stabilized at a lower mean of 101.5 units compared to the previous regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (P35 arrived in 2, P36 in 1). The 'ghost' inventory of 649 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29) remains in the system-reported in-transit (902 total). This means the actual effective pipeline is only 253 units (the order placed in Period 38). Since effective pipeline (253) + on-hand (0) is roughly equal to expected demand over the lead time, I will set mu_hat and L to ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the next cycles. Demand has shown a recent spike to 152 after a period of lower mean (avg ~101), so I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture the demand stabilization since Period 30 but account for the recent volatility. Setting L to 2 confirms the stabilized lead time while accounting for the recent range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized over the last few periods with lead times of 1 or 2 periods (P32: L=1, P35: L=2, P36: L=1, P38: L=1). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 649 units is critically inflated by 649 units of 'ghost' inventory from historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). Subtracting these 649 lost units from the 649 reported in-transit units leaves an effective pipeline of 0 units. Demand has shown a recent upward spike (P38: 152, P39: 134) compared to the Period 30-37 average of ~101. Given the lead time is currently 1-2 periods and on-hand is 119, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand trend (last 5 periods avg ~115) and setting L to an explicit 2 to account for potential 2-period transit times. I use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total cumulative lost units confirmed at 649: P2(145), P6(123), P15(86), P18(53), P19(57), P24(22), P29(163). As of Period 40, these 649 units represent the entirety of the system's 'In-transit' record, meaning the effective pipeline is zero.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system reports 649 units in-transit. However, based on historical evidence and cumulative insights (Period 2 to Period 29), all 649 of these units relate to lost shipments (P2: 145, P6: 123, P15: 86, P18: 53, P19: 57, P24: 22, P29: 163). Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods over the last 5 cycles (P32-P38). Demand has been volatile but shows a slight cooling from the mid-game peak, averaging ~117 units over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). With only 10 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of zero, a significant order is required. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the current mean while accounting for volatility, and set L=2 to be safe against the occasional 2-period arrival.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (P32: L=1, P35: L=2, P36: L=1, P38: L=1). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 649 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero after Period 41. Demand has shown a recent uptick, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging 130 units, compared to the previous 7-period average of ~101. To ensure availability given the zero effective pipeline and zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime. I will set L to 2 (explicit) to reflect the upper bound of the recently observed reliable lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in the current demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline remains zero; the reported In-transit (649 units) consists entirely of confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). Demand regime shift at Period 37: 5-period average increased to 130 units (+28% vs P30-P36).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods, but the system's 'In-transit' figure (649 units) is composed entirely of orders that are long-lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 29). This prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I will set L to 1 and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand since Period 37 has averaged 130 units (123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the zero effective pipeline and upcoming demand, I set mu_hat to 390. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand at the current 130-unit mean, plus a buffer to restore on-hand inventory which is currently zero. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect recent volatility (range 109-152).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits two major characteristics: a massive amount of 'ghost' inventory and significant demand volatility. As of Period 44, the reported 'In-transit' of 649 units consists entirely of known lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero, and with zero on-hand inventory, a substantial order is needed to meet demand and prevent further stockouts. Demand analysis: After a dip in Periods 30-36, demand surged again. The last 7 periods (P37-P43) average 133.7 units, with the most recent sample at 166. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime. Lead time has recently stabilized around 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, with an average of ~1.5. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use this actual historical behavior (averaging ~1.7 to 2 periods) to determine the base stock level required for the next cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed: mean demand increased to 134 units across the last 7 periods (+33% vs P30-P36). Reported 'In-transit' of 649 units remains entirely composed of lost shipments; effective pipeline is zero.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lead time of 1-2 periods since Period 26, though a major segment of 'In-transit' inventory (649 units) is confirmed lost from earlier periods (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). As of Period 44, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is zero because the reported 649 'In-transit' units are the exact units previously identified as lost. Demand shifted upward around Period 37, averaging 134 units over the last 8 periods (P37-P44). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher demand regime and use the default lead time (2) as recent arrivals have been between 1 and 2 periods. Setting parameters to trigger an order is critical as the effective pipeline is empty and on-hand is zero.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, the effective pipeline is confirmed to be zero; all 649 units in the system's 'In-transit' record are lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 29. Demand has stabilized at a higher mean of 134 units since Period 37.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has stabilized to a lead time of 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, but the system's recorded 'In-transit' of 649 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (cumulative losses from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 29). Since these units will never arrive, the effective pipeline is zero. To ensure the OR backend places a correct order, I am setting lead time L to 2 (the promised and typical upper bound of recent successful arrivals) and Using 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the zero effective pipeline. Demand has stabilized at higher levels since Period 37, averaging 134 units over the last 9 periods. I will set mu_hat based on this mean (134 * (1+2) = 402) and adjust it higher specifically for this period to clear the 'ghost' inventory record. By setting mu_hat = 1051 (402 + 649), I effectively neutralize the 649 'ghost' units in the OR calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), forcing an order that covers the next 3 periods of actual expected demand (~402 units).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced extreme instability, specifically a confirmed 'loss' of 649 units from orders placed early in the game (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 29). The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1028 units. After subtracting the 649 confirmed lost units, the effective pipeline is 379 units (the order placed in Period 46). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted several times, with the most recent stability occurring since Period 37, where the mean demand is approximately 134 units, compared to much lower levels earlier in the game. Lead times for successful deliveries recently have ranged between 1 and 2 periods (P32 L=1, P35 L=2, P36 L=1, P38 L=1). I will set L to 2 periods to be conservative given historical volatility. For mu_hat, I will use the mean of the last 10 periods (which covers the current high-demand regime) multiplied by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit pipeline calculation: System In-transit (1028) - Known Lost (649) = 379 units available for future arrival. The demand regime from P37 onwards has stabilized at a higher mean of ~134 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports 1028 units in-transit. However, historical analysis (Carry-over Insights) confirms 649 units are lost from older orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). This leaves an effective pipeline of 379 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 46. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 48 (visible in Period 49's conclude message). Demand shifted starting Period 37, averaging approximately 134 units. However, recent demand in Period 47 dropped to 76. To calculate mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the regime since Period 37 (mean \u2248 128.5). I use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P38, P35/36) stabilized at 1-2 periods. This approach targets a base stock that accounts for the effective pipeline and current demand levels, ensuring we cover the final two periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The supply chain has been extremely unstable with 649 units confirmed lost from historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P29). Subtracting these from the reported 'In-transit' of 1028 leaves an effective pipeline of 379 units (all from the order placed in P46). Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P46 order should have arrived during P48 and be visible now; its absence suggests it is either delayed (L=3+) or potentially lost. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted around P37 to a higher mean of ~134 units, though the very last 3 periods (P46-48) averaged ~115 units. To prevent stockouts in the final two periods of the game (P49 and P50) while accounting for the high probability of shipment failure, I will set mu_hat using the higher regime mean (recent_N=12 for P37-P48) to ensure we cover the remaining demand. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2 to allow the OR backend to calculate the required base stock for the (L+1) window, effectively placing a protective order to cover for the potentially delayed or lost P46 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Effective pipeline is 379 units (P46 order); the remaining 649 reported units are confirmed lost. P46 order (L=2 promised) is overdue as of Period 49 decision phase.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a critical stockout situation. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 1028 units, but 649 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 29. This leaves an effective pipeline of 379 units (ordered in Period 46). This Order P46 is now 4 periods old (placed P46, currently start of P50 phase), which exceeds the promised L=2 and the recently observed L=1 or 2 lead times, suggesting it is either significantly delayed or also lost. Demand since Period 37 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 134 units, though recent volatility is high. Given that this is the final decision period (Period 50), and on-hand is zero, I must set parameters to trigger an order that covers the immediate demand gap and accounts for the 'ghost' inventory. I will use an explicit L of 2 (promised) and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the high-demand regime (P37-P49 average ~126, but the OR backend needs to see the effective pipeline). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to capture the recent regime (~130 units/period) and accounting for the (L+1) factor, the OR engine will attempt to reach the base stock. Note: The OR engine subtracts 'total' in-transit (1028), which is higher than the base stock it will likely calculate, potentially resulting in a zero order unless the base stock is set very high to overcome the 649 'ghost' units. I will maximize mu_hat to ensure an order is generated.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply chain remains critical. Effective pipeline is only 379 units (P46), which is now 4 periods overdue and potentially lost. Demand regime since P37 remains high (avg ~126-130).
