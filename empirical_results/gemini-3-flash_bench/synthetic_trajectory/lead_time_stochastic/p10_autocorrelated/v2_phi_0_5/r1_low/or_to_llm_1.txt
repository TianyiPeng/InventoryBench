The promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the five historical demand samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111), the mean demand is approximately 116 units with a standard deviation of about 25. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 158 units based on these samples and the promised lead time of 2 periods (covering demand for periods 1, 2, and 3). Since there is no prior history to suggest lead time deviations or lost shipments, and the initial demand shows some variance but no clear seasonal trend without specific calendar dates, I will follow the OR baseline.

However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time might be 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost.

Using an average demand of 115 (based on the provided 5-period samples) and a lead time of 2-3 periods, the target inventory level (Base Stock) should be around 345-460 units.

Strategy: A total inventory position of 295 units covers approximately 2.8 periods of demand (295 / 105). Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to ensure we have enough to cover the Review + Lead time (1 + 2 = 3 periods). 295 units is slightly below the 315 needed for 3 periods of average demand.

Given the large pending 'in-transit' shipment from Period 2 (157 units) which is likely to arrive soon, adding too much now creates high holding cost risk ($1.0/unit is equal to the profit).

Average demand P1-P5 was ~86; average demand P6-P10 is ~144. Recent demand is consistently near 150. 4. OR Baseline: The OR agent recommends 0 units, likely because the in-transit total (515) exceeds its base-stock level. However, we have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods due to arrival timing and the lost shipment. 5. Strategy: Even though pipeline is high, the stockouts are punishing. Given the current 0 on-hand and the trend of 150 demand, I need to ensure a continuous flow. The P9 order (150) should arrive in P11. If it arrives, on-hand becomes 150, which matches one period of demand.

Total Pipeline: 498. However, looking at history: P2 (157 units) and P6 (58 units) are confirmed lost/overdue. Total 'Working Pipeline' = 498 - 157 - 58 = 283 units. This consists of P13 (65 units), P15 (80 units), and likely some portion of the In-transit reported that hasn't arrived yet (P11-P12 have already arrived). Actually, In-transit (360) minus known active orders (P13: 65, P15: 80) leaves 215 unaccounted for, which aligns with the lost orders (157 + 58 = 215). Thus, the actual reliable pipeline is On-hand (138) + P13 (65) + P15 (80) = 283 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand since the regime shift at P6 is approximately 125 units (P6-P15: 127, 124, 152, 165, 152, 85, 97, 95, 96, 124).

With 0 on-hand inventory and the possibility that the P41 order (135 units) arrives next period (L=3), I must order to cover the (L+1) period window. Average demand recently is ~135 units. A safe base stock for 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 400-450 units. My 'real' pipeline is 395.

This means the actual functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 42 (130), Period 43 (130), and Period 44 (130), totaling 390 units. Current on-hand inventory is essentially depleted (3 units). Demand has stabilized in a high regime (avg ~130 units).

The 'In-transit' figure of 1695 is significantly inflated by approximately 1535 units of historical losses (as documented in Carry-over insights). The 'Reliable' pipeline consists of the orders from Period 44 (130 units) and Period 45 (135 units). Lead Time Inference: Recent history shows lead times of 2-3 periods (P40, P41 took 3; P43 took 2). Using L=2 as a baseline, the Period 44 order is expected to arrive during the next period (P47) and the Period 45 order in P48. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P43-P45) is steady at 166, 132, 129 (average ~142). The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely accounts for the phantom 'In-transit' inventory. Strategy: To cover demand for P46, P47, and P48 (3 periods * 142 = 426 units), we have 134 current + 265 in reliable pipeline = 399 units. This leaves a small gap. However, since there are only 5 periods left in the game (ending P50) and holding cost equals profit ($1.0), over-ordering is risky.

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a regime mean of ~135 units since Period 6.
