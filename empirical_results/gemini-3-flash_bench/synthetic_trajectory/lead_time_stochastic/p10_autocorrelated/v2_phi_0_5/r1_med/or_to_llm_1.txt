Historical demand for the first 5 periods (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) shows an average of 116 units per period. The OR recommendation of 158 units is based on this historical data and the promised lead time of 2. Applying the logic that your order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1) periods of demand, and considering L=2, we need to cover 3 periods. 116 * 3 = 348 units. However, the OR algorithm's capped recommendation is 158.

Current in-transit inventory is 158.\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 1 was 131, but sales were 0 due to 0 inventory. Historical samples provided show high demand: P1(75), P2(138), P3(134), P4(122), P5(111). Note: The game history 'demand=131' for Period 1 contradicts the 'Period_1: 75' in the samples list; I will prioritize the game history and the high mean of the samples (~116).

Estimated demand for 3 periods is approximately 130 * 3 = 390 units. Current pipeline is 158. Gap is 232 units.\n4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 157 units based on its statistical model. Given the high stockout risk (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a higher volume is justified. However, the OR cap (157) suggests it is trying to smooth the order.

If the P1 order arrives in P4 (visible P5), we will have 158 units. If it's lost, we are in trouble.

The visible in-transit inventory is 377 units, consisting of: P6 (100 - likely lost), P7 (received in P8 history - check error in status count?), P9 (120 units - expected in P10 or P11). Looking at 'In-transit: 377', it likely includes P6(100), P7(100 - though history shows arrived?), P8(300 - though history shows arrived?), and P9(120). Recalculating active pipeline: Only P9 (120 units) is reliable. P6(100) and P7(100) are overdue or erroneous. \n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stepped up significantly: P6 (127), P7 (124), P8 (152), P9 (165). The 4-period moving average is 142. \n4. Strategy: OR recommends 0, likely because it sees the inflated '377 units' in-transit. If we exclude probable lost/delivered units from the pipeline, we need more stock. To cover 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at 150 units/period, we need ~450 total. Current On-hand (135) + Reliable Pipeline (P9: 120) = 255. Gap = 195 units.

Excluding lost orders, reliable pipeline is ~270 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand has shifted significantly upwards. The initial samples averaged ~116, but the last 5 periods (P6-P10) average ~144 units. This represents a sustained regime shift. 4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: OR recommends 0 because it includes the likely 'lost' shipments (257 units) in its pipeline calculation and uses the lower historical average. Following OR's 0 would lead to prolonged stockouts if P9 and P10 orders don't arrive immediately. 5. **Final Strategy**: I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods.

While P11 was lower (85), stockouts have been frequent. The OR recommendation is 0 likely because it sees a massive 'In-transit' number (677) and assumes arrivals are imminent, but roughly 257 units of that pipeline are almost certainly lost. \n3. **Inventory Strategy**: With the reliable pipeline at 420 units and an expected demand of ~140/period, I have roughly 3 periods of supply coming. However, I am currently at 0 on-hand and just suffered a stockout in P11. I need to ensure arrivals soon. I expect the P9 order (120 units) to arrive in P12 (lead time 3) or P13.

Analyzing the specific pipeline: Period 14 (0 units), Period 15 (0 units), Period 16 (0 units), Period 17 (150 units), Period 18 (150 units). Furthermore, checking the 'In-transit' balance of 557 units against recent orders (P17: 150, P18: 150), there are 257 units unaccounted for from older periods (likely Period 2 loss of 157 and Period 6 loss of 100), which matches previous insights. Therefore, reliable pipeline is effectively 300 units (150 arriving P21, 150 arriving P22).\n3. Demand Analysis: Demand has returned to a 'high regime', with the last three recorded demands being 124, 141, 169, and 146 (Average ~145). \n4. Strategy: There is a severe supply gap in the immediate window (Periods 19 and 20). Because lead time is 3 periods, an order placed now (P19) will not arrive until Period 23. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a massive 'In-transit' number (557) and uses a shorter lead time. However, 257 of those units are lost, and the remaining 300 arrive too late for the current stockout.

We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have stocked out for 4 consecutive periods (P17-P20). The demand regime has stabilized at high levels (~145 units recently, though P19-P20 dipped to ~118 while out of stock). To restore inventory and cover upcoming demand across the 3-period lead time window plus the review period (4 periods total), we need approximately 520-550 units in the reliable pipeline.

Lead-time inference: Actual lead time is confirmed to be 3+ periods. Since we have 0 on-hand and have been stocking out for 5 consecutive periods despite orders being placed, the pipeline is clearly non-functional or severely delayed. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 1007 units in-transit against ~2 periods of demand, assuming a lead time of 2. I must override this. Even though 450 units (P19-P21) should theoretically arrive starting in P23, the persistent stockouts and unreliable arrivals require constant ordering to ensure a flow eventually resumes.

Lead-Time & Pipeline Analysis: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with significant periods of lost shipments. Currently, the 'In-transit' figure is misleading at 1407 units. Based on historical data, 1007 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30).

The P33 order (ordered 3 periods ago) should have arrived by now based on recent 1-2 period lead times, but its absence suggests a possible 3-period lead time or further instability. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on the inflated (unreliable) in-transit total. To avoid a stockout in P37/P38, I must ensure a steady flow.

Total reliable pipeline = 450 units. \n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recently, demand has been in a high regime (avg ~120-130 units). The last 3 periods (P40-P42) averaged 120 units. I will use a forecast of 125 units per period.\n\n4. **Strategy**: With a lead time (L) of 2, I need to cover demand for Period 43, 44, and 45 (L+1 = 3 periods). Total needed = 125 * 3 = 375 units. My reliable pipeline is 450 units (arriving over P43-P44). This suggests I have enough total inventory coming to cover the next few periods. However, I am currently at 0 On-hand and the OR recommendation is 0. Given the high demand and the fact that P40 hasn't arrived yet (meaning a potential lead time drift to 3), I will place a modest order to ensure I don't stay at zero if another shipment is lost, while avoiding excessive holding costs given the 450 units in transit.",

Based on carry-over audits, 1107 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) are confirmed or highly likely lost. Subtracting these from the total 1707 leaves a gross pipeline of 600 units.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P43-P44) has spiked to an average of 149 units, consistent with the identified 'high regime' seen periodically. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it likely misinterprets the massive (lost) pipeline as viable inventory. To cover the next 3 periods (average lead time) at a high-regime demand of ~150 units, I need a total inventory position (On-hand + Reliable In-transit) of approximately 450-500 units.
