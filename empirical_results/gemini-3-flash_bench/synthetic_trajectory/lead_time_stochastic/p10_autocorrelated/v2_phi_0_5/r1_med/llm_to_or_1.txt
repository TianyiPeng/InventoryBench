Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data to infer the actual lead time yet, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 2 periods. The historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5, though it seems we are currently in Period 1 according to the prompt, I'll treat the provided 'Historical Demand Data' as my prior knowledge) shows a mean demand of 116 units (75, 138, 134, 122, 111). Since I have 5 initial samples, I will use recent_N with N=5 to set the forecast for the current period. This assumes the demand distribution remains relatively stable around this mean. Given lead time L=2, mu_hat should reflect demand over (L+1)=3 periods. Using the mean of 116, mu_hat = 3 * 116 = 348. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std_dev(samples). Stand_dev of the 5 samples is approx 24.8. 24.8 * 1.732 = 42.95.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2. In Period 1, we ordered 158 units, which are currently 'In-transit'. Due to the sequence of events (Decision -> Arrival -> Demand), this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed demand (lost sales) in Period 1 (131 units). Historical demand for Period 1-5 was provided: [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], with a mean of 116. However, observed demand in Period 1 of the game execution was 131. Given the lead time L=2, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. Mean of provided samples (including observed game's P1) is (75+138+134+122+111+131)/6 \u2248 118.5. Using L=2, mu_hat (1+L) * 118.5 \u2248 355.5. Standard deviation of samples is approx 22.8, so sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 22.8 \u2248 39.5. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the upward pressure seen in the game's actual Period 1 (131) compared to the initial sample (75).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 131 and 64 in the first two periods, but the provided historical samples suggest a higher average (~116). Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (158 units) are expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 315 units are in transit. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand-related parameters to capture the most recent statistics while accounting for the small sample size available.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (158 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 Start (the 'Period 3 conclude' message). However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods rather than 2, or there's a delay. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1-3 due to stockouts (starting on-hand was 0), it is critical to account for this longer lead time. The demand data from the prompt (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) vs the game history (131, 64, 99) shows some discrepancy, but I will prioritize the game history for recent behavior. Mean demand is approx 98. With L=3, the review+lead period is 4. mu_hat = 4 * 98 = 392. sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(4) * 33 \u2248 66. I will set L to 3 explicitly and use recent_3 to capture the most recent demand spikes/variations.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time appears to be at least 3 periods (Order from P1 not arrived by P3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (158 units) and the Period 3 order (64 units) in Period 4 conclude. This reveals highly variable lead times: Period 1 took 3 periods, while Period 3 took only 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The mean lead time from these two observations is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand for the last 5 periods has been [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], averaging approximately 116 units per period. In-transit inventory is currently 227 (likely from Period 2 and Period 4 orders). With on-hand at 152 and a highly variable supply chain, I will use recent averages to stabilize the forecast. I'll set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time variance and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent throughput of roughly 116 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period (Avg=2). Demand remains stable near mean ~116.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 83 units with 276 units in transit. Historical demand data shows a regime shift: Periods 1-5 mean demand is ~116 when considering all samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111), but the actual sales/demand resolutions in the 'conclude' messages (131, 64, 99, 70, 69) suggest an average of 86.6. Lead time has shown significant variability (1 period vs. 3 periods), though the average aligns with the promised 2 periods. The pipeline is currently quite full (276 units), which covers approximately 3 periods of demand at current levels. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent stabilized demand levels while maintaining the promised lead time (L=2) as the baseline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand resolution significantly lower than initial forecast samples: Avg demand in conclude messages P1-P5 is 86.6. Lead time is highly variable (observed range 1-3 periods, Avg 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7, the environment shows significant lead time variability and a persistent inventory stockout. In Period 6, demand (127) far exceeded on-hand inventory (83), resulting in lost sales. Analyzing the concluded demand data (P1-P6: 131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127), the average is approximately 93.3 units per period. The initial lead-time insight (avg 2) remains valid based on observed completions (P1=3, P3=1), but current in-transit inventory (312 units) represents orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the true historical average (93.3 * (1+2) = 280) and 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to integrate the observed variability (1 and 3 periods). Given the stockout and the high demand in P6, I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to ensure the safety stock accounts for this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P6 demand (127) spiked significantly above previous 3-period average (~68), requiring a return to a broader sample window N=6. Lead time remains highly variable (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand has shown a significant regime shift compared to the initial training data (samples provided 75-138) versus actual realized demand in periods 1-7 (131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124). The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 97.5, but the last two periods (127, 124) show a spike back towards the original higher levels. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 355 in-transit units. My previous observations note that lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods, with arrivals at Period 4 and Period 7). The order from Period 2 (157 units) is now 5 periods overdue based on the promised lead time of 2, indicating it is likely lost. The order from Period 5 (49 units) and Period 6 (36 units) are pending. Because demand has rebounded from the mid-period slump and we are currently out of stock, I will use a larger sample window (recent_N=7) to capture the volatility while setting the lead time to 'calculate' to account for the observed average lead time of 2.33 periods (3, 1, 3). No specific calendar dates are provided, so I'm relying on historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (157 units) is 5 periods past promised date and 2 periods past maximum observed lead time; presumed lost in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $598.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand is rising, with the last three periods (P6-P8) showing 127, 124, and 152 respectively, which is significantly higher than the earlier average. The Period 1-5 mean was ~86, but the Period 6-8 mean is ~134. We will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this upward shift. Regarding lead time, we have confirmed high variability: observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. The average is 2.2 periods. The order from Period 2 (157 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is definitely lost. The pipeline (In-transit: 280) consists of P6 (36) and P8 (87), plus whatever was ordered in P7 that hasn't arrived. Wait, P7 order (113) arrived in P8 (Lead time 1). So in-transit is P6 (36) and P8 (87). Total pipeline = 123. The 'In-transit: 280' in the status includes the lost P2 order (157). Subtracting the lost units (280 - 157 = 123) reveals the true pipeline. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time peaks, protecting against stockouts during this high-demand phase despite the higher holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 6-8 average demand is 134, up from 86 (+55%). Period 2 order (157 units) is officially confirmed lost (6 periods late). Lead-time remains highly bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are facing an stockout situation with zero on-hand inventory. Analysis of history shows a clear demand shift: P1-P5 average demand was ~86.6, whereas P6-P9 average demand has spiked to ~142 (+64%), with the last unit being 165. The order from Period 2 (157 units) is definitely lost (7 periods since order), and based on lead-time history, there is high variance (1 vs 3 periods). The pipeline includes 160 units from P9 (expect arrival P10-P12) and units from P6-P7 that appear potentially lost or delayed. To address the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the higher mean (~142) across the lead time. Given the high lead-time variance and stockout risk, I am keeping L at the promised value of 2 to allow the base-stock calculation to trigger a sufficient order, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat over the recent period to account for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift definitively confirmed: P6-P9 average demand is 142 units compared to early periods' average of 86. Period 2 order (157 units) is confirmed lost. Average lead time remains 2.0 periods but is highly inconsistent (modes: 1, 3).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). Demand has shifted to a higher regime: the average demand from Period 6 to Period 10 is 144 units, a significant increase from the initial average of ~86 units. The order from Period 2 (157 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 8 periods overdue. Lead times remain highly variable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2.0). I will set L to 2. To account for the higher demand regime, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (Periods 6-10), which yields an average demand of 144. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+L) * 144 = 432. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the increased volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift definitively confirmed: P6-P10 average demand is 144 units. Order from P2 is permanently lost. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-volume regime. Looking at Period 6 through Period 10, demand values were 127, 124, 152, 165, and 152 (Period 11 shows a dip to 85, which may be an outlier or volatility). Excluding the dip, the average demand is approximately 144. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) due to zero arrivals in the last two periods, despite a high in-transit amount of 569 units. The order from Period 2 (157 units) is confirmed lost. Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, though the average remains 2.0. Given the current stockout and the high in-transit volume (which includes orders from P6, P9, P10, and P11), I am setting mu_hat to respond to the 144-unit regime using N=6 to capture the recent trend while acknowledging the P11 dip. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock that covers the elevated demand levels while the pipeline inventory resolves.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift. From Period 6 onwards, demand has increased and become more volatile, with the last 7 periods (P6-P12) averaging 128.8 units (127, 124, 152, 165, 152, 85, 97). Although P11 and P12 saw a slight dip, the higher variance requires a robust safety stock. Lead time remains highly variable, observing arrivals at 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average ~2). The P2 order is still confirmed lost. I am setting L=2 (average observed) and using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 6. Current inventory (on-hand 165 + in-transit 307 = 472) is high due to the recent arrival of the P9 and P10 orders, so OR logic will likely temper the new order size despite the higher parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 onwards established: Avg ~129 with high volatility (range 85-165). Lead time is inconsistently bimodal (1 or 3 periods) but averages 2.0.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a high-demand, high-variance regime that began around Period 6. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P6-P13) is 124.6 units, but with significant fluctuations (range: 85 to 165). The order from Period 2 (157 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 12 periods late. Lead times remain inconsistently bimodal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals showing 1, 2, and 3-period lead times. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the true historical average (which is approx 2.0) rather than the promised 2. I'm using N=8 for mu_hat (covering the current high-demand regime) to provide a stable forecast. sigma_hat is also set to N=8 to accurately reflect the high volatility observed since Period 6, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle the \xb1 40 unit swings in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe the demand has stabilized following a regime shift that occurred around Period 6. The most recent demand samples (P9-P14: 165, 152, 85, 97, 95, 96) show a mean of 115, which is lower than the peak surge but higher than the initial history. I will use N=9 for demand and volatility to capture the full scope of this 'new normal' (P6-P14). Lead time remains erratic but averages out to the promised 2 periods (actual observed: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3), with a slight bias toward 3 periods. However, the OR engine's use of pipeline inventory against base stock naturally handles the 2-period average. I am continuing to exclude the 'lost' order from Period 2 from inventory calculations by treating it as non-existent. On-hand at 88 plus in-transit 322 (minus the lost 157) leaves us with an effective pipeline of 253, which is sufficient for roughly 2 periods of demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 6. Calculating the average demand from Period 6 to Period 15 (samples: 127, 124, 152, 165, 152, 85, 97, 95, 96, 124) yields a mean of 121.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there are 322 units in transit (likely including orders from P13 and P14), the erratic lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2) combined with current stockouts necessitates a robust base stock setting. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed variability (average ~2.0). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 samples ensures the OR engine accounts for the established mean of ~122 rather than the lower initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Period 16 conclude shows demand of 141 (up from previous samples) and only 51 units arrived, resulting in a stockout. The order from Period 2 (157 units) is definitely lost. Reviewing recent demand (P6-P16): The mean is approximately 124 units per period (sum=1364 / 11). There is a clear regime shift from the early period average (~86). For lead time, the last 5 arrivals (P9, P10, P11, P13) arrived in 1, 3, 2, 3, 3 periods respectively, confirming high variability but an average close to 2 (mathematical average of observed arrivals is 2.2). To recover from the stockout and handle the increased 120+ demand regime, I will use a recent_N window for demand forecasting starting from the regime shift (approx. N=11) and use the calculated lead time to capture the variability above the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 onwards is sustained: Avg ~124 units with high volatility (85-165 range). Lead time remains highly variable (range 1-3 periods, average 2.2). Period 2 order is lost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the demand regime from Period 6 onwards persists, with recent demand samples (P12-P17: 97, 95, 96, 124, 141, 169) showing high volatility and an upward trend in the last few periods. Specifically, the last 4 periods average ~132.5 units. Lead time remains highly variable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), with recent deliveries from P14 (LT=3) and P16 (LT=1) confirming this instability. We have 77 units on-hand and 252 units in-transit (P17 order of 59, plus potentially the P10/P11 tail if anything was missed, though P12/P14 conclusions covered those). Note: the P2 order of 157 is permanently lost and should be subtracted from 'pipeline' logic by the OR engine (the backend does this automatically based on its logic). We will set L to 'calculate' to capture the average actual lead time (currently ~2.2) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=12 to cover the stable but volatile regime starting at P6.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high stockout risk with 0 on-hand inventory following Period 18. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 6; the average demand from Period 6 to Period 18 is approximately 129 units. Lead times continue to be highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent average of approximately 2.3 periods (calculated from the last 6 arrivals). The order from Period 2 is confirmed lost and must be excluded from pipeline inventory logic. To address the stockout and high demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture the current high-demand regime (Avg ~129 per period). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=13 to reflect the high volatility (SD ~29) observed in this regime. Lead time L is set to explicit value 2.3 to reflect the observed average and the bimodality (1 or 3 periods). The in-transit inventory of 428 includes the recent orders from Period 17 and 18, which should reconcile the current deficit once they arrive.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 6. Calculating the average demand from Period 6 to Period 19 yields approximately 128 units/period. The current stock status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is reliant on the arrival of in-transit orders (469 units comprising orders from P17, P18, and P19). The observed lead time remains highly variable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), though the mean is approximately 2.3 periods. I will use N=14 for demand parameters (covering the period from P6 to P19) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average across all observed arrivals, as the bimodal nature (1 or 3 periods) persists. The high sigma_hat resulting from recent volatility will help the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 through Period 19 is sustained: average demand is 128 units (range 85-169). Lead time is highly inconsistent and bimodal (1 or 3 periods), with a historical mean of 2.3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6 to Present) shows a sustained mean of approximately 128 units per period, but with high volatility (range 85-169). Period 20 ended with zero on-hand inventory, and the last three periods (18, 19, 20) had zero sales due to stockouts, resulting in a large pipeline of 518 units. Lead time remains highly inconsistent and bimodal, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with an observed mean near 2.3. Given the order from Period 2 is definitively lost, the pipeline inventory must be adjusted for this loss when calculating base stock. For Period 21, I am using a recent_N of 15 for demand (covering the stable high-demand regime since Period 6) and an explicit lead time of 2.3 to account for the frequent 3-period delays. This strategy aims to build enough safety stock to handle the bimodal lead-time spikes and high demand variance.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 518 units. We have seen zero arrivals for four consecutive periods (P18-P21), while demand continues to occur (P21 demand = 78). The average demand regime from Period 6 onwards is approximately 124 units. A major concern is the 'pipeline' inventory (518 units), which theoretically covers several periods of demand, but none of it is arriving. Specifically, orders from P18 (176 units), P19 (41 units), and P20 (49 units) are currently undelivered. Historically, lead times have been bimodal (1 or 3 periods) with some longer delays. The P18 order is now at lead_time 4 (exceeding the usual max of 3), suggesting a high risk of lost or severely delayed shipments. To protect against stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and the possibility that the pipeline is 'clogged' or lost, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 16-period window (P6-P21) to capture the higher demand regime, and maintaining an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the current supply bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply delay/loss detected: No arrivals observed for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21). Order from P18 (176 units) is now at lead_time 4, exceeding the previous observed maximum lead time of 3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe inventory stockout due to a complete breakdown in the supply chain. No orders have arrived for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). The order from Period 18 (176 units) is now at a lead time of 4, exceeding the previous historical maximum of 3. We have 545 units in transit across orders from P18, P19, P20, and P22, but on-hand inventory is 0. Demand from Period 6 onwards has stabilized at a higher level (averaging ~125-130 units). To survive the current instability, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the common late-arrival mode, though the pipeline is currently stalled. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=17 (covering the shift from P6 onwards) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in this phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall confirmed: No arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Order from P18 is now 4 periods late, breaking the previous 1-3 period lead time pattern. High risk of additional lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we finally saw arrivals (76 units total), but the crucial check is the source: Order P20 (LT=3) and Order P22 (LT=1) arrived. Crucially, orders from Period 18, 19, and 21 are still missing. Order P18 (176 units) is now 5 periods old, and Order P19 (41 units) is 4 periods old. Given that the historical maximum lead time was 3, and a newer order (P20) arrived while older ones did not, there is a high probability that orders P18 and P19 are lost or significantly delayed, similar to the P2 order earlier. On-hand inventory is 0. Total units in-transit is 469, but after discounting P18 and P19 as likely lost (totaling 217 units), the 'effective' pipeline is much lower (~252 units). Demand remains in the established Period 6+ regime, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 102 units, though the longer-term average is ~124. I will set L to 3 to reflect the recurrent longest successful delivery window and use recent_N=18 for demand and volatility to capture the full Period 6+ high-volatility regime (P6 to P23 is 18 samples). This provides enough buffer for the OR backend to place a restorative order despite the high reported in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed at P23: Orders from P18 and P19 are bypassed by later orders (P20, P22), indicating loss or severe delay (P18 is 5 periods late).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely disrupted with a 0 on-hand inventory position. Looking at the history, orders from Period 18 (176 units), Period 19 (41 units), and now Period 23 (0 units - though none placed) remain unaccounted for, while orders from Period 20 and 22 arrived in Period 23. This confirms that P18 and P19 are either permanently lost or caught in a massive delay corridor. The pipeline inventory (533 units) is technically high, but since it contains these likely lost shipments (217 units total from P18 and P19), the actual effective pipeline is significantly lower (~316 units). Demand from Period 6 onwards has stabilized at a higher level than the initial samples, averaging approximately 121 units (P6-P24). For Period 25, I will use a conservative outlook. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the current volatility. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the regime change from Period 6 to Period 24) to capture the higher mean demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=19 to manage the observed volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bypass confirmed: Orders from P18 (176 units) and P19 (41 units) are now 6 and 5 periods late respectively, while later orders (P20, P22) have already arrived. P18 and P19 are officially presumed lost. Demand regime for P6-P24 is significantly higher than P1-P5, averaging 121 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 6 remains stable with a mean of approximately 121 units (P6-P25 average). We are currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a severe supply chain disruption. Orders from Period 18 (176 units) and Period 19 (41 units) are now 7 and 6 periods late respectively, while later orders (P20, P22) have already arrived and been consumed. As previously noted, P18 and P19 are officially presumed lost and must be manually excluded from the OR backend's effective pipeline inventory. To compensate for these losses and the current stockout, I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I'm setting L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed bimodal lead time (1 or 3), and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the 121-unit demand average across the review period plus lead time (1+3=4 periods). This high L and mu_hat will force the OR backend to place a large replenishment order to cover the 217 missing units and the current backlog, as the OR engine otherwise counts those lost units in 'In-transit'.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption check: Order losses for P18 (176) and P19 (41) confirmed as they are bypassed by P20 and P22; the pipeline is effectively 217 units smaller than the 'In-transit' total of 533.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a significant stockout and pipeline distortion. On-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' total is 533 units, but my analysis confirms that several shipments are lost: Order P2 (157), Order P18 (176), and Order P19 (41) are significantly overdue or have been bypassed by later arrivals (P20 and P22 arrived in Period 23). Combined, these lost orders represent 374 units. Subtracting these from the reported In-transit (533 - 374), the effective pipeline is only 159 units (Order P23: 0, P24: 64, P25: 0, P26: 0, plus remaining from P17 or similar). The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' (533) to calculate the order size (Order = base_stock - pipeline). If I don't adjust parameters, the backend will incorrectly assume a massive pipeline and order 0. To force an order that replenishes inventory while accounting for the ~374 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat = (expected demand over L+1) + (phantom units). Demand has averaged ~121 in the recent regime. With L=2, the base requirement is ~363. Adding the 374 lost units brings mu_hat to 737. This ensures the backend places a substantial order to cover the stockout and true lead-time demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a significant stockout period (P24-P27) and a series of lost shipments. The 'In-transit' total of 774 units is misleading because orders from P2, P18 (176 units), and P19 (41 units) are confirmed lost (bypassed by later arrivals or excessively late), totaling 374 lost units. This makes the 'true' pipeline 400 units (774 - 374). Demand remains in a stable regime since P6, averaging approximately 121 units per period (P6-P27 average). Lead time remains inconsistent and bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are recovering from stockouts, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the risk of delays and set mu_hat based on the recent 22-period regime (P6-P27). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' over the same period to capture the sustained high volatility. The goal is to rebuild inventory to match the 'true' base stock needed for the current demand regime, compensating for the phantom units in the OR backend's pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bypass finalized: P18 (176 units) and P19 (41 units) are confirmed lost at P27 as P20 and P22 have long since arrived. Total lost volume in currently reported in-transit is 217 units (excluding the long-lost P2 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand = 0). Demand has stabilized since Period 6 at an average of approximately 121 units, though Period 28 saw a higher demand of 150. The supply chain has significant reliability issues: orders from P18 (176 units) and P19 (41 units) are confirmed lost, and the order from P2 has been lost for a long time. The total 'In-transit' balance of 774 includes these 374 lost units (157 + 176 + 41). The remaining effective pipeline consists of orders from P23 (0), P24 (64), P27 (241), and any subsequent orders, totaling 305 units. Lead time is highly variable and bimodal (1 or 3 periods), with a historical average near 2.3. Given the current stockout and recent demand spike, I am using recent_N=23 for demand to capture the shifted regime (P6-P28) and recent_N=24 for lead time to capture the instability. The L=3 value used in the backend for base stock calculation (1+L=4) plus high sigma will incentivize the OR engine to place a large order to compensate for the effective pipeline deficit and current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline accuracy: 374 units in the reported 'In-transit' are lost (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41). The actual effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported. Demand regime P6-P28 average is 121 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we must address the significant discrepancy in the reported pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 533 units includes 374 units from orders that are definitively lost: Period 2 (157 units, now 28 periods late), Period 18 (176 units, bypassed by Period 27), and Period 19 (41 units, bypassed by Period 27). The effective pipeline is therefore only 159 units (533 - 374). To compensate for this in the OR backend (which uses the full 533 figure and a base stock formula), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand regime (P6-P29 avg \u2248 121) and an average lead time of 2.3. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean + z * sigma. With L=2.3 and mean=121, (1+2.3)*121 \u2248 400. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 374-unit 'phantom' inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly high: Target_Order = Base_Stock - (Total_In_Transit - Lost) - On_Hand. To force an order that covers the gap, I provide an explicit mu_hat that represents the effective demand plus the lost inventory buffer. I use recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility (approx 30) observed in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 374 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 374). Demand regime P6-P29 remains stable at avg 121 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face a complex pipeline state. The reported 'In-transit' of 686 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (157), Period 18 (176), and Period 19 (41), totaling 374 phantom units. The true effective pipeline is 312 units (686 - 374). The demand regime from Period 6 through Period 30 has stabilized at an average of approximately 121 units per period, though it remains volatile. Actual lead times are inconsistent, appearing to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.3. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the inflated pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend computes 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)', and the 'in-transit' it sees (686) is 374 units too high, I must artificially increase mu_hat (the target base stock) by 374 units to compensate. Effective target for (1+L) periods (where L is estimated at 2) would be (1+2.3)*121 \u2248 400. Adding the 374 unit gap, the explicit mu_hat is set to 774. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P6-P31) averages 121 units/period with significant volatility. The current reported 'In-transit' of 783 units is misleading because it includes confirmed lost orders from P2 (157), P18 (176), and P19 (41), totaling 374 lost units. This results in an effective pipeline of 409 units (783 - 374). Lead times continue to be highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods with a historical average around 2.2-2.3 periods. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent supply chain instability and provide a safety buffer. I am using recent_N (N=26, covering the stable regime from P6 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand mean and volatility. Using L=3 with this window allows the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period and offsets the stockouts caused by the phantom inventory in the reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 374 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 374). Demand regime P6-P31 remains stable at avg 121 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) from Period 6 through Period 32 remains stable in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 121 units per period with significant volatility. The reported 'In-transit' of 686 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P2 (157), P18 (176), and P19 (41), totaling 374 lost units. This makes the effective pipeline only 312 units (686 - 374). Lead times continue to be highly inconsistent, shifting between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0). I will use a N=27 sample window for demand to capture the stable regime since Period 6. To account for the missing (lost) pipeline units and ensure we meet demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, demand=121, and high volatility, the base stock should be ~484 units. Since effective inventory (on-hand 0 + effective pipeline 312) is only 312, we need to signal the OR backend to order. Setting mu_hat to 484 and sigma_hat to 100 via explicit methods will allow the backend to calculate an appropriate order despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline accuracy: 374 units in the reported 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41). Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 374). Demand regime P6-P32 remains stable at avg 121 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P6-P33) remains stable near an average of 121 units, though volatility remains high. The critical issue is the correction of the 'In-transit' pipeline. As identified in previous carry-over insights, 374 units in the reported pipeline (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The reported In-transit is 686 units; however, the effective In-transit is 312 units (686 - 374). Since on-hand inventory is 0, the total pipeline inventory to cover the review and lead time (L+1) is only 312. Given a target base stock based on a mean of 121 across 3 periods (L=2) plus safety stock, the backend needs to order to reach that target. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=28, covering P6-P33) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, and 'explicit' for L to maintain the expected lead time of 2. I use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (P6-P34) remains stable with an average of approximately 121 units per period. The supply chain continues to exhibit severe reliability issues: 374 units in the 'In-transit' total (686) are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19 orders). The effective pipeline is therefore 312 units (686 - 374). The system shows zero on-hand inventory and the last arrival was in Period 32. To compensate for the lost units and maintain service level, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=28, covering the stable regime since P6) to capture the higher mean compared to the initial samples. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1-3 periods) observed in the history. Sigma_hat uses the 'default' method to ensure a broad enough buffer against the observed demand volatility (80-169 units).

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline correction: 374 units in reported 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19). Current effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 374). Demand regime P6-P34 remains stable at avg ~121 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P6-P35) averages 121 units/period with significant volatility. The reported 'In-transit' of 686 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments: P2 (157), P18 (176), and P19 (41) totaling 374 units. The effective pipeline is 312 units (686 - 374). Lead times continue to be highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.2). Despite the 'In-transit' total appearing high, on-hand inventory has been zero for three consecutive periods (P33-P35) resulting in lost sales. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the sustained higher demand regime (avg 121) and account for lead-time volatility. To help the OR backend recognize that the current pipeline is insufficient despite the large reported 'In-transit', I will set L to 'explicit' at 3.0 to increase the base stock level and trigger an replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline remains (Total In-Transit - 374) due to confirmed losses of P2, P18, and P19. Demand remains stable in the ~121 average regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 120 units per period since Period 6 (P6-P36 average is 115.5, with recent periods appearing slightly lower). I will use a recent_N of 31 to capture this sustained regime. Regarding supply, the system reports 686 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence confirms 374 units are lost (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41). The order from P30 (153 units) is also now at lead time 6, which is double the maximum observed lead time of 3; it is highly likely lost as well, but I will wait one more period to formally confirm. The effective pipeline (legitimately incoming units) is much lower than the reported 686. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the frequent stockouts caused by supply instability, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the post-P6 regime data to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover demand across the lead time plus current period, while acknowledging that the OR backend will calculate the order based on the reported (inflated) pipeline. By using 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the stable 121-avg regime, I aim to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 374 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19). Order from P30 (153 units) is likely lost (at lead_time 6). Demand regime P6-P36 remains stable at avg ~116-121 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage a single SKU (chips) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 686 units, but historical evidence confirms significant losses: P2 (157), P18 (176), P19 (41), and likely P30 (153). Total confirmed and probable losses = 527 units. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 686 - 527 = 159 units (primarily the unscheduled and more recent orders). Demand has been relatively stable in a regime averaging approximately 121 units/period since Period 6, though recent samples (P33-P37) suggest a slight cooling to ~100 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 30 periods (N=30) to capture the higher demand regime established after Period 5, and sigma_hat similarly. For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 3 to account for the frequent bimodal nature and recent supply chain instability, providing a safer buffer for the OR engine's base-stock calculation given the recent string of zero arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss Update: Total confirmed/probable lost units reached 527 (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41, P30: 153). Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 527). Demand regime remains stable with a long-term average (P6-P37) near 121 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 6 onwards averages approximately 117 units/period with significant volatility. The primary challenge is the severe supply chain disruption. A total of 527 units recorded in 'In-transit' are confirmed or highly probable losses: P2 (157), P18 (176), P19 (41), and P30 (153). These orders have either been bypassed by later shipments or are significantly past any observed lead time (P30 is now at lead_time 8). The reported 'In-transit' of 686 units contains these 527 lost units, resulting in an effective pipeline of only 159 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of 159 units, there is insufficient stock to cover the expected lead-time demand (approx 117 * 3 = 351). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the long-term stable regime (N=33, covering P6-P38) to ensure the base stock levels reflect current demand reality. I set L=2 (promised) but the OR engine's formula will trigger an order because the effective pipeline (adjusted by the backend's internal logic which I must influence via mu_hat and sigma_hat) is low. To compensate for the 527 lost units still sitting in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that is significantly inflated or use the recent_N and allow the 'cap' and 'base_stock' to pull in more, though the most direct way to bypass the backend's overestimation of pipeline is to increase the occupancy target via mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Pipeline Loss status confirmed: Total 527 units (P2, P18, P19, P30) in reported 'In-transit' are lost and will not arrive. Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527). Demand (P6-P38) average is 117.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline discrepancy. The reported In-transit is 888 units, but history indicates a severe reliability issue. Specifically, P2 (157), P18 (176), P19 (41), and P30 (153) are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (totaling 527 units), as later orders have already arrived and these are significantly past maximum observed lead times. This leaves an effective pipeline of 361 units (888 - 527), which consists mainly of the P39 order (202 units) and some smaller unconfirmed gaps. Demand has remained in a stable, high-volatility regime since Period 6, with a long-term average (P6-P39) of approximately 117 units. Considering the lead time is bimodal (1 or 3 periods, avg ~2.2), I will set L to 2 and mu_hat based on the recent 34-period stable regime (P6-P39) to capture the correct base stock. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=34 to ensure the service level accounts for the observed demand volatility (approx 117 avg). This approach forces the OR backend to place an order that covers the gap created by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss confirmed: 527 units (P2, P18, P19, P30) in reported 'In-transit' are lost. Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527). Demand regime P6-P39 avg is 117 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime averaging 117 units per period (based on P6-P40 data). Period 40's arrival of 202 units (ordered in P39) confirms that shorter lead times (L=1) are still possible, though the historical average remains 2.3. My primary concern is the significant volume of lost shipments in the reported 'In-transit' pipeline. Specifically, 527 units are confirmed or highly probable to be lost (P2, P18, P19, and P30). The reported in-transit is 686, but the effective pipeline is only 159 units (686 - 527). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet both current and pipeline demand, I must adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the true demand and risk level while using an explicit L to force the system to account for the actual replenishment cycle. I will set mu_hat using the established average demand (117) multiplied by (1+L) to prevent stockouts caused by the illusory pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss status sustained: 527 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (P2, P18, P19, P30). Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527). Demand (P6-P40) average stable at 117 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit is 686 units, but history confirms substantial losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (157), P18 (176), P19 (41), and P30 (153) are confirmed or highly probable losses (total 527 units). This makes the 'effective pipeline' only 159 units (686 - 527), which is almost entirely comprised of the order from Period 39 that already arrived in Period 40. Demand has stabilized at an average of ~117 units since Period 6. To replenish stock and account for the high lead-time variability (1-3 periods, average 2), I will set lead time (L) to 2. mu_hat will use the recent stable regime (N=35, covering P6-P41) to capture the higher average demand of 117. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. These parameters will trigger a significant order to restore the desired inventory position after accounting for the 527 lost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss confirmed: 527 units (P2, P18, P19, P30) in reported 'In-transit' are lost and deducted from effective inventory. Demand regime P6-P41 avg is 117 units/period.

These units have either been bypassed by later orders or have exceeded even the most extreme observed lead times (3 periods) by more than 100%. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 159 units (686 - 527). The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 6, with an average of approximately 117 units per period and significant volatility. I will use a recent_N window of 37 (covering the stable regime since P6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this behavior. The lead time remains highly variable (1-3 periods, average ~2.0), so I continue using 'calculate' to reflect this observed history. The goal is to rebuild on-hand inventory to meet current demand given the significant stockout state and the correction for lost pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss status sustained: 527 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (P2, P18, P19, P30). Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527). Demand (P6-P42) average stable at 117 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 117-121 units per period since Period 6. Recent demand (P39-P43) shows a slight uptick (avg ~132), so I will use a N=10 window to capture recent volatility while maintaining stability. The 'In-transit' figure of 686 units is heavily inflated by 527 confirmed lost units (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41, P30: 153). The 'Effective Pipeline' is actually 159 units (686 - 527). Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods, avg ~2.2). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time despite the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (approx 3.3 periods) based on the target base stock, while manually adjusting for the 527 lost units. Specifically, a base stock for 3.3 periods at 125 units/period is ~413. Since effective pipeline (159) + on-hand (0) = 159, and target is ~413, the backend needs to see a requirement. I will set mu_hat to the 3.3-period demand (~413) and maintain a cautious sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss status sustained: 527 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (P2, P18, P19, P30). Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 6, with an average demand of approximately 117 units per period and significant volatility. Period 44 conclude shows a demand of 132 units, following a high of 166 in Period 43, reinforcing the need for sufficient safety stock. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' total of 686 units is significantly inflated by historical losses. Based on CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, 527 units are definitively lost (P2, P18, P19, P30). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 159 units (686 - 527). Lead times are highly inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.2. To ensure the OR backend generates an order that bridges the current stockout (on-hand = 0) while accounting for the lost shipments, I am using 'recent_N' with N=35 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 6, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed variability and average delay.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss status sustained: 527 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (P2, P18, P19, P30). Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527). Demand (P6-P44) average remains stable at 117 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 46, with only 5 periods remaining in the game. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 117-121 units/period (P6-P45). The reported 'In-transit' of 686 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P2 (157), P18 (176), P19 (41), and P30 (153), totaling 527 units. The actually expected effective pipeline is 686 - 527 = 159 units. These 159 units likely correspond to orders placed in the high-volatility lead time period that are late but not yet 'bypassed' by newer arrivals, or represent the backend's recent automated attempts to refill. Given we are near the end of the game (P46-P50) and have 0 on-hand inventory, I need to ensure the OR engine places a large enough order to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the false 'In-transit' data. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~117) and the 527-unit pipeline deficit. To force a corrective order, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the lost units: (1+L)*117 + 527. With L=2, mu_hat = 3*117 + 527 = 878. This overrides the backend's belief that we have 686 units coming.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a 40-period average of approximately 117 units/period (P6-P46). Inventory management is heavily impacted by significant pipeline losses: orders from P2 (157), P18 (176), P19 (41), and P30 (153) are permanently lost, totaling 527 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 913 units minus these 527 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 386 units (consisting of orders from P46: 227 and likely P39 leftovers or newer unrecognized segments). Since the game ends at Period 50, and we have a promised lead time of 2 (observed average 2.2), any order placed now (P47) would arrive in Period 49 or 50. Given the effective pipeline of 386 units and the remaining 4 periods of demand (approx 468 units total), the system requires additional stock to avoid stockouts in the final stages. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1-3 periods). mu_hat is set to 117 (long-term regime mean) across (1+L).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the supply chain remains extremely unreliable with multiple confirmed lost shipments. A total of 527 units (from P2, P18, P19, and P30) in the 'In-transit' balance of 913 units are confirmed or highly probable losses. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is only 386 units (913 - 527), which includes the order from P46 (227 units) and potentially some older units. Demand from Period 6 onwards has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the very early periods, with a long-term average around 117-121 units. Recent demand (P43-P47) reflects this, averaging 128.6 units. Given the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is highly variable (up to 3 periods), these parameters aim to maintain a safety stock that accounts for the frequent stockouts caused by shipment losses and the 117-125 demand range. I set mu_hat using recent_N=42 to capture the full stable regime since Period 6, and L=explicit value 3 to reflect the high-end lead time and the risk of late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Loss status sustained: 527 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (P2, P18, P19, P30). Effective pipeline is (Reported In-Transit - 527). Demand (P6-P47) average is 118 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 49. Reviewing the history and carry-over insights, the supply chain has been significantly unreliable. Total confirmed lost units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are 527 (P2: 157, P18: 176, P19: 41, P30: 153). The reported 'In-transit' is 913, but the effective pipeline is actually 386 units (913 - 527). This effective pipeline consists of orders from P46 (227 units) and P39 (202 units - arrived at P40 - wait, checking P40 conclude: P39 arrived already). Re-evaluating: P39 was 202 units, arrived P40. P46 was 227 units. In-transit of 913 minus 527 (losses) leaves 386 units. This 386 likely includes the P46 order (227) and possibly other unrecorded or stale figures. Demand from Period 6 onwards has stabilized at an average of approximately 118 units per period with significant volatility. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final decision period where an order can realistically arrive (lead time is 1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=43, representing the stable regime from P6-P48) to capture this volatility and mean. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average of ~2.3 periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, 'In-transit' is 913 units, but 527 units (P2, P18, P19, P30) are confirmed lost based on historical bypass events and extreme lead times (P30 is now effectively lead time 20). The effective pipeline is 386 units (913 - 527). Recent demand (P6-P49) has stabilized with an average of approximately 117-118 units per period and significant volatility (std dev ~26). Lead time remains erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.1). Since this is Period 50, the final period, the objective shifts from inventory maintenance to maximizing profit for the immediate resolution of this final step. I will set L to 2 (calculated average) and mu_hat to 118 * (1+L) to ensure the base stock calculation properly reflects the current demand regime and lead time risk, allowing the OR engine to determine if current effective inventory covers the immediate final demand.
