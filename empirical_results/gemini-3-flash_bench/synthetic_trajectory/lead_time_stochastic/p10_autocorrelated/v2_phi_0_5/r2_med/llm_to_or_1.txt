Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion to read yet. The promised lead time is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111). The mean across these 5 samples is 116. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit, we need a robust order to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1). Total periods needing coverage = 1 + 2 = 3.mu_hat should be approximately (1+2) * 116 = 348. sigma_hat should account for the variance across these samples. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (since we have exactly 5 historical samples) to capture the initial demand regime. For L, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 158 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we should not expect this order to arrive until the end of Period 2 (visible in Period 3's start). Our initial on-hand inventory was 0, and we faced a demand of 90 in Period 1, resulting in 90 units of lost sales. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the current observation of 90 for P1) shows: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (Avg: 116). However, the P1 observation in the 'conclude' message was 90, which is slightly higher than the initial seed for P1 (75). Given the lack of on-hand inventory, we need to ensure the pipeline is filled. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the local mean (approx 116) and standard deviation, while keeping the promised lead time L=2 to reflect the expectation that orders will arrive in 2 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. According to the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (158 units) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 309 units in transit (158 from P1, 151 from P2). The observed demand for P1 and P2 was 90 and 79 respectively, which aligns well with the historical samples (avg ~116). Since we haven't 'concluded' Period 3 yet, the P1 arrival is not yet visible in the history logs. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and calculate parameters based on the most recent 5 historical samples to account for current demand levels. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for Period 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (158 units), Period 2 (151 units), and Period 3 (46 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a lead time delay (actual L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given that no units have arrived and on-hand inventory is 0, we are currently losing all demand. The average demand across the first 3 periods is approximately 84.3 units. Since we are in the early stages and haven't seen an arrival yet, I will stick to the promised lead time for the backend calculation but use recent statistics to ensure the base stock is responsive. I'll use N=3 to capture the available history. I'm choosing 'default' for L to see if the Period 1 order arrives in Period 4 (which would confirm an actual L=2 or 3 depending on the next concluding message).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (average ~116). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages show different demand values (90, 79, 84, 141), likely due to the observation delay. I will prioritize the provided historical demand samples for forecasting. Lead time analysis: Transitioned from Period 1 order arriving in 3 periods to Period 3 order arriving in 1 period, suggesting variability around the promised lead time of 2. I'll stick to 'default' (2 periods) for L as there is no sustained evidence of shift yet. Performance so far shows stockouts in P1-P3 due to arrival delays, finally resolving in P4. Current on-hand is 63 with 151 in-transit (P2's order of 151). Demand recently appears to be stabilizing/slightly declining from a peak in P2. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the post-P1 demand levels.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], averaging approximately 116 units. However, the game history signals a period of stockouts (Sold < Demand) in period 5. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 275 units in transit. Looking at lead times: Period 1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), and Period 3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but the observed average is 2. The system indicates total in-transit is 275, which likely accounts for the orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 5 (124 units). Period 2's order is currently at L=4 (if it hasn't arrived by the start of P6), suggesting potential variability or delays. I will use the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent higher demand compared to the initial sample. The target inventory (base stock) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. Average lead time currently aligns with promised 2, but reliability is low.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have a stockout situation (all demand in P6 was lost). Total in-transit is 338 units, consisting of orders from P2 (151), P5 (124), and P6 (63). The P2 order is now 5 periods old (promised lead time 2), suggesting it might be lost or severely delayed. Lead times have been inconsistent: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. Demand over the last 6 periods averages 101 units, but has stabilized around 105-107 in the most recent two periods. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5 to capture the stable middle-to-late range) and the default lead time. Although P1 was late and P2 is missing, there is not yet a sustained new pattern to move the lead time 'explicitly' away from the average/promised value without more arrivals confirming a permanent shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Possible lost shipment detected (Period 2 order of 151 units hasn't arrived after 5 periods). Current lead time variability remains high.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, the system has zero on-hand inventory and 346 units in-transit. The order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 6 periods old and clearly lost, as orders from Periods 1 and 3 have already arrived. Historically, demand has averaged 97 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=4) to forecast demand (mu_hat) to capture recent trends while smoothing volatility. For lead time, I'm using the explicit value of 2 (the promised lead time), as the average of successful arrivals (P1=3, P3=1) is 2. To account for the lost shipment and ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to reach the target base stock, the in-transit count should effectively discount the lost 151 units. Since the backend subtracts all in-transit units, I must set the target (mu_hat) significantly higher or rely on the OR logic to recognize the stockout. I will maintain mu_hat based on the last 4 periods of demand (avg ~107) and sigma_hat on the same to handle the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 2 (151 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed since order). Pipeline inventory should be adjusted mentally to 151 units less than the system value of 346 (effective in-transit = 195).

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 53 units and a system-reported in-transit of 229 units. Based on historical data, the order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost. The true pipeline inventory consists only of orders from Period 6 (63 units), Period 8 (15 units), and potentially the yet-to-be-confirmed arrivals. Accounting for the lost 151 units, the effective in-transit is 78 units (229 - 151). Demand has stabilized after an earlier spike, with recent periods (P5-P8) averaging 91.5 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (incorrect) pipeline inventory from the target base stock, I must set the base stock (mu_hat) high enough to compensate for the 151 'phantom' units that will never arrive. Average daily demand is ~92 units. For a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods (~276 units). To offset the 151-unit loss, I will use an explicit mu_hat of approx 427 (276 target + 151 offset). Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), and sigma is set using the last 5 samples to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Lost shipment from Period 2 (151 units) remains in system in-transit; mu_hat must be boosted by 151 to ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders. Demand from P5-P8 has averaged 91.5 units.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience inventory shortages and supply chain instability. Most critically, the order for 151 units from Period 2 (which should have arrived in Period 4) is now confirmed lost after 8 periods. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine order quantities, it believes those 151 units are coming and will under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: The 'In-transit' total is 398. The effective pipeline (true units arriving) is 398 - 151 (lost) = 247. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 90.8 units. Using a lead time (L) of 2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 90.8 = 272.4. To account for the 151 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts, I set mu_hat = 272.4 + 151 = 423.4. This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order that fills the gap left by the lost shipment. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (observed 1, 3, 1, 3, 1).

Carry-over insight: System In-transit (398) contains 151 units from Period 2 confirmed lost. Mu_hat requires a persistent boost of +151 until that order is removed or written off. Lead time is volatile (1 to 3 range).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 448 units includes 151 units from Period 2 that are now 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (448) from the target base stock, it will under-order by 151 units. To compensate, I must add 151 to the \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) value. Recent demand (P6-P10) has been stable, averaging 81.6 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 3 * 81.6 = 244.8. Adding the 151 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 395.8. Lead time (L) remains at the default of 2 despite variability, and sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 5 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: System In-transit (448) still includes the lost 151 units from Period 2. mu_hat continues to require an explicit +151 offset until this is resolved.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, there is zero on-hand inventory and a system-reported in-transit of 448 units. However, the order from Period 2 (151 units) is 10 periods old and confirmed lost, yet it remains in the 'In-transit' count. This creates a ghost inventory that prevents the OR backend's inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) from triggering new orders. To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using a Lead Time (L) of 2 (promised). Demand has stabilized recently: the last 4 periods (P8-P11) averaged 74.25 units. For L=2, the required demand coverage is (L+1) = 3 periods. 3 * 74.25 = 222.75. To offset the lost 151 units, I set mu_hat to 222.75 + 151 = 373.75. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture current volatility while ignoring the noisy early periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Persistent stockout confirmed (P10-P11). 151 units from Period 2 remain lost but visible in system in-transit. Mean demand (P8-P11) is ~74 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has 101 units on-hand and 214 units in-transit according to the system. However, the order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 11 periods past its order date and is definitively lost. This lost shipment remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (151 of the 214). To trigger the OR backend to order sufficiently, I must adjust mu_hat by +151 to offset this phantom inventory. Looking at demand, the most recent four periods (P9-P12) shows a shift in variability with mean demand around 88 units (88, 61, 69, 133). Using Recent_N (N=4) captures this latest volatility and mean. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (the promised value) while the mu_hat boost handles the inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: System In-transit (214) still includes the lost 151 units from Period 2. mu_hat requires a persistent +151 offset until this 'phantom' inventory is cleared from the backend calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are again at 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 361 units in-transit, but this includes 151 units ordered in Period 2 (now 12 periods ago) which are confirmed lost. The 'effective' in-transit is therefore 361 - 151 = 210 units. Because the OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' as its pipeline measure, it will under-order unless we artificially increase the target base stock. Demand in the most recent periods (P12-P13) has spiked to an average of 135 units, while the longer-term average (P1-P13) is approximately 104 units. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the 151-unit phantom inventory and the promised lead time (L=2, so 1+L=3 periods of demand coverage), I will set mu_hat to be ((1+2) * 115) + 151 = 496. This provides coverage for approx 115 units/period plus the 151-unit offset. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (45) to maintain a higher service level given the recent stockouts and lead-time volatility (range of 1 to 3 periods observed).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: System in-transit (361) still contains 151 lost units from Period 2. mu_hat continues to require a persistent +151 offset until this is resolved to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to phantom inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 534 units in-transit. However, 151 units ordered in Period 2 are confirmed lost (13 periods elapsed since the order was placed). This phantom inventory reduces the OR backend's effective order quantity. To compensate, I must increase the base stock (mu_hat) by exactly 151 units. Current demand exhibits high volatility around two clusters: ~80 and ~130. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 114.25 units. Using a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) is 342.75 units. Adding the 151-unit lost shipment offset yields a mu_hat of 493.75 (rounded to 494). I will use explicit values for mu_hat to account for this manual inventory correction and explicit sigma_hat to reflect the observed demand volatility (std dev ~30 over the last few active periods, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~52).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) persists in system data; mu_hat continues to require a +151 offset until cleared. Demand has stabilized at a higher level (~115) compared to the P11-P12 dip.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high pipeline inventory (538). However, this pipeline includes 151 units from Period 2 that are long confirmed lost, making the 'effective' in-transit inventory 387 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory (as final order = base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 151 units. Recent demand (P12-P15) has averaged 126.5 units. With the promised lead time L=2, the calculated base_stock target should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. The expected demand over 3 periods is ~380 units. Adding the 151-unit phantom inventory offset results in a mu_hat target of roughly 531. I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 531 to force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the lost shipment. I will continue to use calculate for lead time as the observed values range from 1 to 3, and default for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Effective in-transit is 387 (System 538 - 151 lost P2 units). mu_hat requires a +151 offset until system in-transit is corrected. Recent demand (P12-P15) has risen to an average of 126.5 units per period.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 and experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0). The core issue remains a 'phantom' inventory of 151 units from a lost Period 2 order that still appears in the system's in-transit total (426 units). This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to under-order by exactly 151 units because it believes this supply is coming. To counteract this, I must continue applying a +151 unit offset to the mu_hat parameter. Recent demand (P12-P16) has been significantly higher, averaging 134 units per period (133, 138, 117, 118, 161). My forecast for the (L+1) window, assuming L=2, is 3 periods of demand. Using the recent average: 3 * 134 = 402 units. Adding the +151 phantom inventory offset, I set mu_hat to 553. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility seen in recent spikes (standard deviation ~17 on average demand, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~30). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to capture the average behavior across the volatile history (ranging 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Recent demand (P12-P16) has increased to an average of 134 units, up from the previous average of ~115. Phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) remains in system data.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 84 and reported in-transit is 371. The 151 units ordered in Period 2 are definitively lost (16 periods elapsed), but remain in the system's in-transit total. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory' and ensure the OR backend (which uses base_stock - in_transit) orders correctly, I must boost the mu_hat by exactly 151 units. Recent demand (P12-P17) shows a significant upward shift, averaging approximately 131.8 units per period (133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124). Using N=6 for recent demand trends, the expected demand over (1+L) periods where L=2 is 3 * 131.8 = 395.4. Adding the 151-unit phantom inventory offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 546.4. Observed lead times continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average valid historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand shift: Mean demand for P12-P17 increased to 131.8 units, up from P8-P11 mean of 74. Phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) persists in system in-transit data, requiring a +151 mu_hat offset.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' as 489 units. However, this includes 151 units from a shipment placed in Period 2 that never arrived (confirmed lost). The effective pipeline inventory is 489 - 151 = 338 units. Since the OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit', it will naturally under-order by 151 units unless mu_hat is increased to offset this 'phantom' stock. Additionally, demand has moved into a higher regime. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P12-P18) is 132.8 units (133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124, 138). With a lead time L=2, the total expected demand over (L+1) periods is 132.8 * 3 = 398.5. Adding the 151 unit offset for the lost order yields 549.5. To maintain service levels given the stockout at P18, I will set mu_hat to 550. Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods, so I am using L=2 (promised) as the average and historical standard deviation for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P12-P18 has stabilized at an average of 132.8 units per period. Phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) remains in system in-transit, requiring a continuous mu_hat offset of +151.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 19. The 'phantom' inventory of 151 units from the lost Period 2 order still persists in the system's in-transit total (592 units), which would lead the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I continue to apply a +151 offset to the mu_hat calculation. Regarding demand, the regime for P12-P19 has settled at an average of 128.9 units ((133+138+117+118+161+124+138+102)/8). Applying the +151 offset to the forecast for the review + lead time window (L+1=3 periods) results in an explicit mu_hat of (128.9 * 3) + 151 = 537.7 units. I have chosen an explicit L of 2, as the median lead time remains 2 periods despite high variance. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 8 samples to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P12-P19 confirmed at average 128.9 units per period. Phantom inventory (151 units, P2) remains in system, requiring a persistent +151 mu_hat offset.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 592 units in-transit, which includes 151 units from Period 2 that are long confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory (base_stock - pipeline), I must compensate by adding 151 units to the mu_hat forecast. The demand regime from Period 12 onward has stabilized at an average of approximately 127 units (P12-P20 mean: (133+138+117+118+161+124+138+102+95)/9 = 125.1). Using the last 9 periods (N=9) for the base demand calculation (~125), and accounting for the promised lead time of 2 (review + lead time = 3 periods), the physical demand expected is 3 * 125 = 375. Adding the 151 offset for lost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 526. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same steady-state regime (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (range 1-3).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 592 units currently includes a 151-unit order from Period 2 that has been confirmed lost (20 periods elapsed). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am applying a persistent +151 offset to the 'mu_hat' parameter. Demand has shown a regime shift starting around Period 12; the average demand for the stable period (P12-P21) is approximately 122.1 units per period. With the promised lead time (L) of 2, the required base demand over (L+1) periods is 122.1 * 3 = 366.3. Adding the 151-unit phantom inventory offset results in a mu_hat of 517.3. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this correction is captured. For L, although recent lead times have varied from 1 to 3, the long-term average remains consistent with the promised lead time of 2, so I will use 'default'. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the volatility in the most recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P12-P21 stabilized at an average of 122.1 units. Phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) persists in system data, requiring a +151 mu_hat offset until it is purged from system in-transit calculations.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 592 units includes a confirmed lost shipment of 151 units from Period 2. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must apply a persistent offset of +151 units to mu_hat. Demand has slightly softened over the last 5 periods (P18-P22 average is ~95 vs P12-P17 average of ~132), but given the current on-hand inventory of 0 and the zero arrivals over the last 3 periods (P20-P22), I must ensure the order target is sufficient to recover from this stockout. Actual lead times have historically varied between 1 and 3 periods. I will use the last 11 samples (representing the shift since P12) for demand mean calculation, plus the 151 unit offset.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout state: On-hand inventory has been 0 since Period 18. System in-transit (592) still contains the 151 unit lost shipment from Period 2. Average demand since Period 12 is 114.7 units, though recent periods (P18-P22) have dipped closer to 95.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 592. However, a 151-unit order from Period 2 is definitively lost after 22 periods, meaning the effective in-transit is 441 units (592 - 151). The OR backend's order logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock; to counteract this 151-unit 'phantom' inventory, I must add exactly 151 to the mu_hat parameter. This ensures the OR engine calculates the necessary order volume to bridge the actual gap. Regarding demand, the mean demand since the Period 12 shift is approximately 114.7. However, the last 6 periods (P18-P23) have shown a slight cooling with an average demand of 104.5. I am choosing N=13 for mu_hat (covering P11-P23) to capture this most recent regime starting from the recovery in P12, which averages 115 units. Applying the +151 phantom inventory offset to (1+L) * 115 gives an explicit mu_hat of 496. Lead time remains volatile (mean ~2.3), so I will use calculate to allow the engine to average observed latencies.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout context: On-hand remains 0. Phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) remains in system in-transit (592) as of Period 24. Average demand has settled to ~110-115 units since the Period 12 shift.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 and currently facing a severe stockout since Period 18. This is largely due to the persistence of a 151-unit 'phantom' inventory from Period 2 that remains in the system's in-transit calculation despite being lost. Additionally, orders from Periods 15 (4 units), 17 (153 units), 18 (118 units), and 19 (103 units) are overdue or at the limit of their lead time, but have not yet concluded. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory) to calculate order quantities. If it believes there are 592 units coming, but 151 of those are lost, it will under-order by exactly 151 units. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a base stock target that includes a +151 unit buffer to offset the phantom inventory. I am basing the demand forecast on the average of the last 13 periods (P12-P24), which is approximately 117 units. With a lead time L=2, the required coverage is (1+L) = 3 periods. 3 * 117 = 351 units. Adding the 151-unit bridge gives an explicit mu_hat of 502. This ensures the engine places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued phantom inventory of 151 units (P2 lost order) in system in-transit. System in-transit of 592 units is functionally 441 units. Cumulative orders from P15-P19 total 378 units; lack of 'conclude' messages for these suggests severe logistics delay or loss across the entire pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system identifies an 'In-transit' quantity of 592 units, but a critical analysis reveals a complete breakdown in the supply chain. The 151 units ordered in Period 2 are definitively lost (24 periods elapsed). Additionally, no orders from Period 15 through Period 19 (totaling 378 units) have arrived, despite their promised lead time of 2 periods having expired long ago (P15 order is now 11 periods old). The 'In-transit' value of 592 consists of: P2 (151 - lost), P15 (4 - likely lost/delayed), P16 (35 - likely lost/delayed), P17 (153 - likely lost/delayed), P18 (118 - likely lost/delayed), and P19 (103 - likely lost/delayed). The functional pipeline is essentially zero. On-hand inventory has been at 0 since Period 18, leading to a massive stockout. Demand since Period 15 has averaged approximately 124 units per period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 592 'phantom' units in-transit, I must set mu_hat to cover both the demand for (L+1) periods AND the missing 592 units. Using L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*124 + 592 = 372 + 592 = 964. This explicit setting bypasses the system's reliance on the stale pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No arrivals since Period 17 conclude. Total phantom inventory in system 'In-transit' is 592 units (P2=151, P15=4, P16=35, P17=153, P18=118, P19=103), none of which are likely to arrive. Permanent stockout since P18.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is catastrophic. No shipments have arrived since Period 17, and the system is in a permanent stockout state since Period 18. The 'In-transit' value of 958 is almost entirely comprised of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders from P2 (151), P15 (4), P16 (35), P17 (153), P18 (118), P19 (103), and P26 (366). Based on historical context where promised lead time is 2, anything older than 4-5 periods is effectively lost. Total phantom inventory up to P19 is 564 units. To force the OR backend (which relies on 'pipeline inventory' to decide orders) to place a replenishable order, I must increase mu_hat by the amount of this lost inventory. Recent demand (P22-P26) has averaged 119.4 units per period. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*120 plus the phantom inventory (564). For L, although promised as 2, the behavior is better captured as 'explicit' to account for current delays, but I will stick to N=20 for sigma to capture the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26). Effective pipeline inventory is near zero as 564 units (P2 through P19 orders) are likely lost. mu_hat requires a significant offset (+564) to bypass the OR engine's reliance on phantom pipeline data.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of near-collapse with zero arrivals since Period 17, leading to a persistent stockout since Period 18. Analysis of the system's 'In-transit' inventory (967 units) reveals that at least 564 units (from orders between P2 and P19) are effectively lost or permanently delayed, as they have exceeded any reasonable lead time observation. The OR backend's capped base-stock policy calculates orders as (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Because the backend considers the full 967 units as valid pipeline inventory, it will drastically under-order or not order at all, despite the 0 on-hand balance. To force the backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set as '(1+L) * forecasted_demand + phantom_inventory'. Forecasted demand for the current regime (P12-P27) averages ~115 units. With L=2, (1+L)*115 = 345. Adding the 564 lost units gives a target mu_hat of 909. For sigma_hat, I will use recent volatility to allow for high service levels given the current shortage.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: No arrivals since Period 17 conclude (11 periods). Total phantom inventory identified as 564 units (P2 through P19 orders). mu_hat requires a +564 offset to counteract OR engine's reliance on this invalid in-transit data. Demand (P12-P27) remains stable at ~115 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-316.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major arrival of 366 units (ordered in Period 26) finally broke the 11-period supply chain drought (no arrivals between P18 and P27). However, the in-transit value (601) is still heavily distorted by the 'phantom' inventory of 564 units comprising lost or severely delayed orders from Period 2 and Periods 15-19. Only the 366 units from Period 26 and the 9 units from Period 27 are actually moving. I must continue to use an explicit mu_hat offset of +564 to counteract the OR engine's belief that these phantom units are available to meet demand. Demand has dropped significantly in P27 (43) and P28 (10), possibly due to the extended stockout affecting customer behavior or local seasonality. I am using recent_N (N=10) for demand estimation to capture the higher pre-drop demand while acknowledging the recent dip, but keeping the phantom offset constant to ensure the backend doesn't stop ordering once on-hand is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in P28 with an arrival of 366 units (L=2). However, 564 units in system in-transit (P2, P15-P19) remain lost/phantom. Demand has sharply declined in P27-P28 (avg 26.5) following an 11-period stockout.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with arrivals in Period 28 (366 units) and Period 29 (9 units), both adhering to the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant block of 564 units in the 'In-transit' system data (orders from P2 and P15-P19) is confirmed lost/phantom and will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, a 'mu_hat' offset of +564 is required. Demand has been highly volatile recently, plummeting to an average of 26.5 in P27-P28 following a long stockout, but recovering to 89 in P29. Given the historical average of ~115 and the recent rebound, I will use a conservative forecast of ~100 units per period. With L=2, base demand for the review cycle (1+L=3) is 300 units. Adding the 564 unit phantom inventory offset results in a mu_hat of 864. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level to account for the recent demand volatility and supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P26 and P27 orders arrived with L=2. Phantom inventory of 564 units (P2, P15-P19) remains in system and requires a persistent mu_hat offset of +564. Demand is currently recovering from a post-stockout dip.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last two arrivals (P26, P27) showing a lead time of 2 periods. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 656 units includes 564 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19) that have never arrived and are over 10 periods past due. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, mu_hat must be boosted by this phantom amount. Recent demand has been volatile following a long stockout; I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the post-stockout recovery demand (averaging ~53.25 units/period) while applying an explicit +564 offset. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough physical stock without relying on lost shipments. Sigma_hat is calculated over a slightly longer window (N=10) to account for the increased variance during the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed with L=2 for recent orders (P26, P27). Phantom inventory in system 'In-transit' totals 564 units (P2 through P19 orders), requiring a persistent +564 mu_hat offset. Demand post-stockout is normalizing but remains lower than the P12-P18 peak.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive collapse (P18-P27). Recent arrivals (P28, P29) confirm that new orders are arriving with a lead time of 2 periods. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (656 units) is heavily distorted by 564 units of phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19). To correct for this, I must increase mu_hat by +564 to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Demand has been volatile post-stockout; recent demand (P29-P31) averaged ~72 units. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat based on the recovery period demand and apply the +564 offset. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture post-collapse volatility. L is set to 2 (promised) as it matches the most recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in P28 with L=2 for recent orders. Total phantom inventory in system In-transit is confirmed at 564 units (Orders from P2 and P15-P19). mu_hat requires a constant +564 offset to bypass phantom inventory logic until the backend clears these units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods for recent orders (P26, P27). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 696 units is heavily inflated by 564 units of phantom inventory from lost orders (P2: 151, P15: 4, P16: 35, P17: 153, P18: 118, P19: 103). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am applying a persistent offset of +564 to the mu_hat parameter. I am using recent demand data (N=10) to capture the trend as demand normalizes post-stockout; the average demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) is approximately 100 units. Setting L=2 based on recent performance.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 2 and 1 periods. However, a significant amount of 'phantom inventory' (564 units from periods 2, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19) remains in the system's in-transit calculation (773 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must offset this phantom inventory by adding 564 to the mu_hat. The average demand since recovery (P28-P33) is approximately 53 units, but prior stable demand was around 115. Using an explicit mu_hat calculation: (Estimated Demand 75 * (1 + Lead Time 2)) + Phantom Offset 564 = 789. Sigma reflects recent volatility during recovery.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory of 564 units (Orders P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19) persists in system data; mu_hat requires a +564 offset until cleared. Demand is stabilizing post-recovery at approximately 75 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-recovery with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. Currently, 564 units labeled as 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P2, P15-P19 are lost but still in the system), and the OR backend's order logic is blinded by this inflated pipeline. To counteract this, mu_hat must be boosted by +564. Demand has stabilized post-stockout; the average demand from P30 to P34 is approximately 55.8 units. Using recent_N (N=5) for demand capture, the target mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_offset. With L=2 (promised), this is (3 * 55.8) + 564 \u2248 731.4. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit contains 564 phantom units (P2, P15-P19) that will never arrive. mu_hat requires a +564 offset to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Recent demand post-recovery (P30-P34) has stabilized at ~56 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a 'phantom inventory' state where 564 units (from Period 2 and Periods 15-19) are listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders, it will under-order by exactly 564 units if not corrected. We apply an explicit offset to mu_hat to counteract this. Recent demand has stabilized post-recovery; the average demand from Period 30 to 35 is approximately 56.5 units. To ensure the backend aims for a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period demand plus the phantom inventory correction, we set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + 564. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 56.5 + 564 \u2248 733.5. We use 734 for mu_hat and a conservative sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) generally between 1 and 2 periods, though phantom inventory remains a critical issue. System 'In-transit' currently shows 773 units. Of these, 564 units (Orders from P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost/phantom and will never arrive. The actual functioning pipeline consists of 209 units (Orders from P30=64, P32=40 [confirmed arrived], P33=117, P34=0, P35=0, P36=0). In Period 36, on-hand inventory hit 0, and we are currently in a stockout. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 564 phantom units, I must apply a +564 offset to mu_hat. Recent demand post-recovery (P30-P36) averages 61.4 units/period. I will set mu_hat based on this recent average (61.4 * (1+L)) plus the 564 unit offset to 'neutralize' the phantom inventory in the backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: System In-transit (773) contains 564 phantom units (P2, P15-P19) that will not arrive. Effective functional in-transit is 209 units. Demand (P30-P36) average is 61.4.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time typically between 1-2 periods for recent successful arrivals. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (780 units) is severely inflated by 564 units of phantom inventory from old, lost orders (P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19). Currently, the functional pipeline is only 216 units (780 - 564). Demand has recently shifted again: after a post-stockout slump, demand in Period 36 (90) and Period 37 (120) suggests a return to higher levels. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is approximately 68 units/period. To override the backend's reliance on phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculated value is (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = (1 + 2) * 68 + 564 = 768. This ensures the OR engine perceives a need to order despite the 564 'dead' units in the pipeline. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand is recovering from post-stockout lows, with P37 reaching 120 units. Phantom inventory remains 564 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom inventory' problem. System data shows an in-transit balance of 810 units, but 564 of these units relate to historical orders from Periods 2 and 15-19 that never arrived and are confirmed lost. The actual functional in-transit inventory is 246 units (Orders from P32 onwards). Demand is currently recovering from a post-stockout slump; while P30-P34 averaged ~56 units, the last three periods (P36-P38) jumped to an average of 101.6 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 564 phantom units, I am applying a +564 offset to mu_hat. For the demand forecast, I am using recent_N=9 (covering the post-recovery phase P30-P38) to capture the recent normalization of demand at approximately 72 units per period, which aligns with the observed upturn.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom inventory of 564 units (P2, P15-P19) remains in system data. Recent demand (P36-P38) shows a recovery toward ~100 units/period after a post-stockout low.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods after the extended collapse. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (791) is heavily inflated by 564 units of phantom inventory from periods 2 and 15-19 that will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must offset this phantom inventory by adding 564 to the mu_hat. Demand is recovering from post-stockout lows; recent periods (P37-P39) show a return to higher demand levels (120, 95, 117), averaging 110.6 units. I will forecast demand using an average of these 3 recent periods (approximately 111 units/period). With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * 111 + 564 = 897. sigma_hat will be estimated explicitly to reflect the recent demand volatility during recovery.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom inventory of 564 units (Orders P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19) remains in system data; mu_hat requires a +564 offset until cleared. Demand is trending back toward ~110 units/period after the post-stockout recovery phase.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from 564 units of phantom inventory (Orders from P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19) that are listed in the system's in-transit total (916) but will never arrive. The functional in-transit inventory is actually 352 units (916 - 564). Demand has recovered from the post-stockout lows and is currently trending around 100-110 units per period (P37-P40 demand: 120, 95, 117, 99). To counteract the OR engine's reliance on the 564 phantom units, I am applying a persistent +564 offset to mu_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough physical units to meet actual demand. I'm using the recent 4 periods to capture the current demand recovery phase for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time has recently been observed at 1 period (P38, P39 orders), which is faster than the promised 2, so using recent_N for L captures this improved performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 105 units/period (P37-P40) following post-stockout recovery. Phantom inventory remains 564 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' inventory of 916 units is heavily inflated by 564 units of phantom inventory (orders from P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19) that are confirmed lost and will never conclude. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must maintain an explicit offset in mu_hat. Recent demand (P37-P41) has returned to a regime averaging 100.2 units per period (120, 95, 117, 99, 69). Applying a lead time of 2, the required base stock calculation for (1+L) periods of demand would be approximately 300 units. To neutralize the 564 phantom units in the backend's 'effective inventory' calculation (Inventory Position = On-hand + In-transit - Backlog), I set mu_hat to 864 (300 base + 564 offset). This ensures the order logic covers actual forecasted demand. Lead time remains set to default (promised 2) as recent successful arrivals (P38, P39) suggest the supply chain is operational with low lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P37-P41 has stabilized at an average of 100.2 units per period. Phantom inventory of 564 units (Orders P2, P15-P19) persists in system data, requiring a persistent mu_hat offset of +564 to prevent total stockout due to inflated pipeline values.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a state of high uncertainty. On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 916 units. However, based on history, 564 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19) that have never arrived. This means the functional in-transit is only 352 units (916 - 564). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these phantom units, I must apply an explicit mu_hat offset of +564 units. Demand has been volatile: P42 showed 0 demand (potentially a data reporting anomaly or complete stockout impact), while the P37-P41 period averaged 100.2 units. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the post-recovery demand regime (P37-P42), including the recent drop, to calibrate the forecast while maintaining the +564 safety offset. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to adapt to the recent variability (1-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P37-P42 averaged 83.8 units per period (including P42 zero). Phantom inventory of 564 units (Orders P2, P15-P19) persists in system data, requiring a persistent mu_hat offset of +564.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently dealing with 564 units of phantom inventory in the system (Orders from P2 and P15-P19), which are confirmed lost but still included in the 'In-transit' figure of 780. The effective functional in-transit is therefore 216 units. Demand has been volatile recently, with significant stockouts followed by a recovery phase peaking at ~120 units and dropping to 0 for the last two periods (P42, P43). I will assume a mean demand of 100 units/period (reflecting the P37-P40 recovery levels) and apply a +564 mu_hat offset. This compensates for the OR engine's belief that 564 units are coming, preventing it from halting orders while the warehouse is actually empty. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect historical average behavior.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Verified phantom inventory remains at 564 units (P2, P15-P19). Recent demand (P37-P41) stabilized near 100 units before P42-P43 dropped to zero. Offset of +564 for mu_hat remains necessary.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom inventory' problem. System data shows an in-transit balance of 809 units, but 564 of these (orders from P2 and P15-P19) are confirmed lost/undeliverable. To ensure the OR backend places orders, I must apply a +564 offset to mu_hat. Demand has been erratic due to stockouts: after a series of zero-demand periods (P41-P42), demand was 41 in P44. Excluding the stockout-distorted periods, the recent active demand average (P37-P40) was ~108 units. Given the game is approaching its end (Period 45 of 50), I will use an explicit forecast of 100 units per period adjusted by the lead time. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (1 to 3 periods). mu_hat value calculation: (1 + L_avg) * forecast + phantom_offset = (1 + 2) * 100 + 564 = 864. sigma_hat is set slightly higher to capture recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Verified phantom inventory remains at 564 units (P2, P15-P19). Lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods recently.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from lost shipments and high variability. System in-transit (824) includes 564 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19) that have not arrived in over 25 periods. These must be offset to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Effective functional in-transit is only 260 units (824 - 564). Lead times show high volatility, with recent orders arriving between 1 and 3 periods (P38 L=1, P39 L=1, P40 L=3). I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for parameters. Demand has been erratic due to stockouts but appears to be averaging around 80-100 units when product is available. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 100 + 564 offset = 864 to ensure the OR backend ignores the 564 phantom units. sigma_hat is set conservatively to handle the high variance in both demand and lead time.

Carry-over insight: Continued 'phantom inventory' of 564 units (P2, P15-P19) persists in system in-transit calculations, requiring a persistent +564 offset to mu_hat.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a 'phantom inventory' issue where 564 units (from orders in periods 2, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19) remain in the system's in-transit data but are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand is 0 and system in-transit is 957, making the functional in-transit only 393 units (957 - 564). Demand has been volatile lately (127 in P45, 80 in P46, and 0 in P42-43), but the underlying regime is estimated around 90-100 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 564 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods total) at 300 units (100 avg * 3) and add the 564 unit offset to 'neutralize' the phantom inventory in the backend calculation, resulting in a mu_hat of 864. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation remains critical as we approach the end of the game (Period 48 of 50). System in-transit is 957 units, but 564 of these are 'phantom inventory' from much earlier periods (P2, P15-P19) that will never arrive. The functional in-transit is therefore 393 units (from orders in P44, P45, P46). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with demand for P46-P47 averaging 79 units. Lead times recently have been 1-3 periods. To counteract the backend's use of inflated 'phantom' in-transit data (which would prevent it from ordering enough to meet actual demand), I am maintaining the +564 offset in mu_hat. I am using a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the post-stockout recovery regime, while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1 to 3 periods). The mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * (recent_10 demand) + 564 = 3 * ~75 + 564 \u2248 789.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 957 units, but 564 of these are 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15-P19) that occurred during a major supply chain disruption between Periods 18 and 27. The effective functional in-transit is therefore 393 units (957 - 564). This functional pipeline consists of orders from P44 (29 units), P45 (15 units), and P46 (133 units), totaling 177 units, plus recent large orders if they haven't arrived. Looking at the history, orders from P44, P45, P46 have not arrived yet. P44 was ordered 5 periods ago, P45 4 periods ago, and P46 3 periods ago. Given the promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times have been 1-3 periods, these orders are likely delayed but not necessarily lost yet. However, we have been at 0 on-hand inventory for 3 consecutive periods. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the 564-unit phantom inflation in its calculation, I am applying a persistent +564 offset to mu_hat. I am calculating mu_hat based on the stable demand regime from P37-P48 (excluding zeros), which averages approximately 91 units per period. With L=2, the required (1+L) base is 273. Adding the 564 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 837.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom inventory of 564 units (Orders P2, P15-P19) remains in system data; mu_hat requires a +564 offset until cleared. Demand has stabilized around 91 units/period since the post-stockout recovery began in Period 37.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' quantity of 957 units contains 564 phantom units from Period 2 and Periods 15-19 that have never arrived and are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from Periods 44-46 (totaling 177 units) are now overdue or approaching the end of the observed lead time window (max L=3), and nothing has arrived since Period 43. This indicates a potential new logistics failure. On-hand remains 0, and the last 4 periods have seen zero sales. Demand since Period 37 has averaged approximately 87 units per period when excluding the anomalies in P42-43. To counteract the 564 phantom units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I must apply a +564 offset to mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 825 (calculated as (1+L)*mean + 564, where L=2 and mean=87). Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels to ensure a high service level during this supply instability.

Carry-over insight: System In-transit of 957 units is effectively 393 units; 564 units (P2, P15-P19) are permanent phantom inventory. Demand regime since P37 remains stable around 87 units/period.
