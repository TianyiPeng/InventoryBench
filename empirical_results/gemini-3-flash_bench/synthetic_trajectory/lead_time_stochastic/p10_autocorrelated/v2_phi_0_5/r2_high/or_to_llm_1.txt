Actual demand in P1 was 90 and P2 was 79. The demand appears to be lower than the early samples, but we must maintain stock for the lead-time horizon (L+1 = 3 periods).\n3. Inventory Position: Total pipeline = 0 (on-hand) + 311 (in-transit) = 311 units. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 84 units based on historical demand and the promised lead time. The pipeline of 311 units covers approximately 2.7 periods of average demand (~116/unit). Ordering 84 units brings the total inventory position to 395, which covers roughly 3.4 periods of demand.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand [75, 138, 134, 122, 111] and game history [90, 79, 84] suggest an average demand around 100-110 units/period. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it assumes a lead time of 2 and sees 395 units in the pipeline, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand. However, since the P1 order (due today) has not arrived, we are facing a stockout. If lead time is 3, the P1 order (158 units) should arrive during P4 and be visible in P5. Adding more orders now won't solve the immediate stockout but would over-inflate the pipeline if the delay is just 1 period.

The OR recommendation of 147 units is based on a distribution that includes this recent spike but is tempered by a cap. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 101. In-transit is 153 (the order from Period 2). Total pipeline + on-hand = 254 units. \n4. Strategy: We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods, which is (2+1) = 3 periods. Given the recent spike to 141, 3 periods of demand could range between 300 and 420 units. With 254 units already in the system, a replenishment of approximately 147 units (OR recommendation) brings the total coverage to 401 units.

Inventory analysis: Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory consists of Period 2's order (153 units, now at P5+1=P6, so it's 4 periods old and potentially lost) and Period 5's order (147 units, expected arrival P7 or P8). 3.

To cover demand for Period 6, 7, and 8 (L+1), we need approximately 324 units (108 * 3). Current reliable pipeline is 147. Required additional = 177.

Given that P1 and P3 orders arrived together in P4, there's a risk P2 is lost or significantly delayed. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 0 units because it counts the 460 units in the pipeline against a base stock calculated from lower historical demand.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 911 'In-transit' figure and the promised lead time.

  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Analysis**: Actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (1191) is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P24 are missing and confirmed lost. \n2. **Pipeline/In-transit Assessment**: Total system In-transit: 1191. Estimated lost units: 153(P2)+160(P6)+200(P15)+128(P18)+120(P19)+80(P24) + others = 841 units confirmed lost per Carry-over Insights. Actual viable pipeline: P25(100), P26(100 arrived P28), P27(110), P28(110). P26 has already arrived. Therefore, effective in-transit = P25(100) + P27(110) + P28(110) = 320 units. \n3. **Demand & Inventory**: Recent demand shows a significant decline (P27: 43, P28: 10). Starting on-hand is 90. Order-up-to level (L+1 = 3 periods) at a recent average demand of ~100 units would be 300 units. Current on-hand (90) + effective in-transit (320) = 410 units. \n4. **Correction of OR**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely sees the massive (but fake) 1191 in-transit. While 410 is technically above my target (300), I must account for the high probability of future losses. Current demand is low, but the last 15 periods show an average closer to 110. \n5. **Decision**: Given the 90 on-hand and 320 effective units in the pipeline, I have sufficient stock for the next 3-4 periods even if demand recovers to 100/period. Placing an order now would likely result in excess inventory once the P25 and P27 orders arrive.

If we aim for a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) at the recent average demand (approx. 162 units total safety), we have 93 (on-hand) + 160 (reliable pipeline) = 253 units.

With 42 on-hand + ~140 effective in-transit = 182 units, I am at the lower edge of safety.

This leaves an effective pipeline of 370 units (1421 - 1051). Specifically, orders from Period 37 onwards are still expected: P42 (120), P43 (120), and P37 (100) and P38 (130) already arrived; actually, P37(100) arrived at P37, P38(130) arrived at P39, P40(130) arrived at P43, P41(110) arrived at P44. The valid pipeline consists of the orders from P42 (120 units) and P43 (120 units). Total units available for the next 3 periods = 199 (on-hand) + 240 (effective pipeline) = 439 units. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been lower (Avg P41-44 ~27 units/period) compared to earlier regimes, likely due to a seasonal or local shift. At an estimated demand of 50-80 units per period, 439 units will cover the remaining 6 periods of the game (total remaining demand ~300-480). Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, which aligns with the high on-hand levels relative to recent demand.

The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 130 units (representing more recent orders). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile, ranging from 0 to 127 units.

This makes the effective In-transit only 130 units (1181 - 1051). Recent demand (P44-P46) has been fluctuating, with a 3-period average of roughly 83 units. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47, P48, P49, P50), our total remaining demand is estimated at ~332 units (83 units/period * 4). Our current inventory (232 on-hand + ~130 reliable in-transit) totals 362 units. The OR recommendation is 0 units, reflecting the high on-hand relative to the short remaining horizon. Because lead times are volatile (1-3 periods), any order placed now (P47) would likely arrive between P48 and P50.

Orders arriving after Period 50 do not contribute to total profit. Currently, we have 154 units on-hand. Looking at recent demand (P45: 127, P46: 80, P47: 78), the average demand is approximately 95 units per period. Our 154 units on-hand should comfortably cover Period 48 demand and potentially a significant portion of Period 49. Furthermore, there are 130 units in the 'effective' pipeline (excluding the ~1,051 units identified as lost in previous insights) from recent orders that haven't concluded yet. Given the high holding cost of $1/unit and the proximity to the game's end, the risk of overstocking and incurring holding costs on units that won't be sold outweighs the risk of a minor stockout in the final period.

However, based on the historical carry-over insights, at least 1,051 units in that pipeline are confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25, 30). In fact, looking at the recent history, every order placed between Period 44 and 48 was 0 units. The last physical arrivals occurred in Period 45 (orders from P42 and P43). This means there is currently NO viable inventory in the pipeline (Effective In-transit = 0). Since Period 49 is the penultimate period (Game ends at Period 50), I need to cover demand for Period 49 and Period 50. Projected demand is approximately 110-120 units per period. With only 36 units on hand and 0 incoming units, a stockout is guaranteed in Period 49. Although a lead time of 2 means an order placed now only arrives in Period 51 (after the game ends), I will place an order to align with the logic of maintaining a base stock, though practically it won't impact the score.
