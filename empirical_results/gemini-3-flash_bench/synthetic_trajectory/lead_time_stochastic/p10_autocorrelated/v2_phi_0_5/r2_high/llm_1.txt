To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for the lead time duration plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the average of 116, the target inventory level is roughly 348 units. Since I have 0 inventory and 0 in-transit units, I will place an order for the full target amount of 350 units to establish a pipeline and begin making profit as soon as arrivals occur (expected in Period 3).",

Historical base demand (pre-game samples) averaged ~116; game history demand (P1-P3) averaged ~84. Inventory Analysis: We have 0 on-hand and 500 in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (350 units) should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests we are experiencing a delay or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. If actual lead time = 3, the P1 order (350) arrives during P4 (available P5). If actual lead time = 2 was correct, the P1 order is likely lost or significantly delayed. Pipeline Assessment: We have 350 (from P1) and 150 (from P2) in-transit. Total in-transit = 500. Expected demand for lead time + 1 (covering P4, P5, P6) at a conservative rate of 100/period is 300 units. Current pipeline (500) covers this if orders arrive. However, since the P1 order is already overdue (promised for P3, not seen in P3 conclude), there is a high risk of stockouts.

However, Period 4 saw a sharp jump to 141. It is unclear if this is a spike or a regime shift.

In-transit = 450 total (150 from P2, 150 from P4, and 150 ordered in the current decision phase for P5 - Wait, looking at history: P2 ordered 150, P3 ordered 0, P4 ordered 150).

Period 42 showed a demand of 0, which appears to be a systemic data artifact or a temporary stockout/reporting issue rather than a collapse, as previous periods were consistently near 100. I will treat the base demand as 100 per period. The inventory is currently 0, with a reported 'In-transit' of 1720 units. However, based on the historical pattern and 'Carry-over insights', the only valid (likely to arrive) pipeline consists of orders from P40 onwards (P40: 150, P41: 150, P42: 150). All previous orders (e.g., P37 and earlier) are confirmed lost or severely delayed. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods). To maintain a service level for (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~400 units), while the valid pipeline is 450 units, I must account for the high probability of order loss seen throughout the history.

Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), stocking out is far more expensive than holding surplus.

Since current on-hand is 156, and we have live pipeline orders (P44: 100, P45: 80) scheduled to arrive (L=2-3), the current stock combined with incoming shipments is more than sufficient.

Recent demand has been around 141 units (P49), 118 units (P48), and 78 units (P47). There is high confidence that demand in Period 50 will exceed our current stock of 15.
