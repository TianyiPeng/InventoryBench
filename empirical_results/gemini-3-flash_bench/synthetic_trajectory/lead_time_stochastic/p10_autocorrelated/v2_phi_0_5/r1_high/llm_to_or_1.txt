Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips (Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first five periods (provided in context) shows values: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111. The mean of these 5 samples is 116. Standard deviation is ~24.9. Since we are at the very beginning of the game (Period 1) and have no prior history of lead-time drift or lost orders, I will use the promised lead time (L=2) and statistical methods based on the 5 available samples to set the initial base stock. The target service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the 5 samples scaled by (1+L) = 3. For sigma_hat, I'll use the standard deviation scaled by sqrt(1+L) = 1.732.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (158 units) is currently in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand 131). The historical demand samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show a mean of 116. Using the full history of 5 samples (including the Period 1 demand of 131) helps establish a baseline mean (approx 118.5). Since we are in the early stages and have a promised lead time of 2, the inventory position needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture all available data points and the default lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, on-hand inventory remains at 0 while 315 units are in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (158 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. Demand has shown significant volatility (131 in P1 vs 64 in P2). Given the inventory deficit (0 on-hand), the backend needs to target a base stock level that covers the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3). I will use the mean of the available historical demand samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) which is 116. I'll set mu_hat using the 'default' method (which calculates (1+L)*mean) to ensure we cover the pipeline risk. Lead time L is set to default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand data provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) shows a higher average (approx. 116) than the demand seen in the conclude messages (Period 1-3: 131, 64, 99; avg 98). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, because the promised lead time (L=2) means the first order placed in Period 1 (158 units) is only expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible/usable in Period 4. However, the Period 3 'conclude' message shows arrived=0, which confirms that even with L=2, the stock hasn't hit the 'ending inventory' yet or the arrival is slated for Period 4's arrival phase. Since we see 'In-transit: 417' (158 + 157 + 102), no orders have been lost yet; they are simply following the lead time logic. I will use the recent 5 demand samples (avg 116) to set mu_hat. With L=2, the lookahead window is (L+1) = 3 periods. 116 * 3 = 348. The standard deviation of these 5 samples is approximately 25.4. Sqrt(3) * 25.4 is approximately 44.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the start of the simulation. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed in Period 4 conclude were 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). The P2 order (157 units) is currently late (ordered P2, should have arrived by P4 if LT=2, or P5 if LT=3); however, the system shows 161 units in-transit, which matches the P2 order (157) plus the P4 order (4). This indicates the P2 order is still active but delayed. Demand has been fluctuating: 131, 64, 99, 70 (avg ~91). Because of the lead time variability (1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 3 to be conservative and protect against stockouts during delays. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the initial behavior, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1190.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods shows values of 75, 138, 134, 122, and 111 (mean = 116). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages show lower 'demand' figures (e.g., Period 1 demand=131 vs user historical data 75), but I will prioritize the provided sequence [75, 138, 134, 122, 111] for forecasting. Current on-hand is 121, and in-transit is 276. Regarding lead time: Promised is 2. Our history shows Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3) and Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1). Period 2 (ordered 157 units) has not arrived yet as of Period 5 conclude, meaning it is at least L=3 or lost. Given the shiftiness, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average valid arrivals. For mu_hat, the demand appears relatively stable after an initial jump; using recent_N with N=4 focuses on the most representative data. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 6. Historical demand samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) and actual game demand (131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127) show a mean around 100 units/period (average ~104). The lead time is volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered 157 units) is currently overdue (placed 5 periods ago), suggesting it might be lost. P5 and P6 orders are still within the promised 2-period window. Given the stockout and the missing P2 shipment, I need to raise the base stock level. I will use the last 6 periods of game demand to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the promised lead time (L=2) as the baseline for the OR backend, as the calculation would be skewed by the outliers.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable: observed L=1 and L=3. Period 2 shipment (157 units) is potentially lost/highly delayed (5 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been exceeding supply for the last two periods. Historical demand data (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) and recent period demand (131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124) show a mean of approximately 100.8. However, lead times are unpredictable: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1, and Period 4 in 3. Crucially, the Period 2 order (157 units) has not arrived after 5 periods and is likely lost. The pipeline inventory (363) includes this suspect order. If we subtract the likely lost order (157), the effective pipeline is 206 units (consisting of orders from P5, P6, and P7). Given the promised lead time of 2 and observed volatility (avg ~2.33), I will set L=3 to be conservative. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=8) to capture the full range of recent demand fluctuations (avg ~100). For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 60 (approx 1.5 * recent std) to increase the safety stock buffer given the supply chain instability and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 shipment (157 units) remains un-concluded after 5 periods (expected L=2), confirming it is likely lost. Lead time variance remains high (Range: 1 to 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2837.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (ordered 157 units, now 7 periods overdue). The observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. While the average is 2.2, the frequent 3-period arrivals suggest the OR engine's default L=2 might be too optimistic. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval. Historical demand shows a recent upward trend: Period 6 (127), P7 (124), P8 (152), compared to the earlier average of ~100. I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~118/period). Total in-transit is 294 (from P6, P8 orders). Given the lost shipment (P2) and the current on-hand of 51, a conservative L and recent demand mean will help build a safer buffer against lead time volatility and stockouts seen in Periods 6 and 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 6: average demand increased from ~100 to ~120 (+20%). Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3115.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) shows a sustained demand increase, with mean demand rising to 142 units (127, 124, 152, 165), confirming the regime shift noted in previous insights. Lead time remains highly unstable, with observations of 1 period (P3, P7, P8 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). The P2 order (157 units) is definitely lost as it has been 8 periods. To account for the higher demand regime, I will setting mu_hat using recent_N=4. For lead time, while volatile, the 'calculate' method will average out the 1s and 3s to reflect an expected lead time around 2, providing a balanced base stock calculation. On-hand inventory is low (20), but 336 units are in transit (P6, P9 orders), which should cover the pipeline if lead times hold at 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for P6-P9 is 142 units, a ~40% increase from the initial P1-P5 mean of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 511 units in-transit. The Period 2 order (157 units) is definitely lost as it is now 9 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. Recent demand (P6-P10) has significantly shifted upwards to an average of 144 units (127, 124, 152, 165, 152), compared to the initial P1-P5 average of ~87 units. Lead times are extremely volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). To account for the lost P2 shipment which is still counted in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must use an 'explicit' L to increase the base stock level and 'explicit' mu_hat to reflect the new demand regime (1+2)*144 = 432. Since 157 units of the 511 in-transit are lost, the OR's effective pipeline is actually 354. I will set mu_hat higher to compensate for the lost inventory logic in the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at P6: Mean demand is approximately 144 units, a 65% increase over initial periods. Period 2 shipment (157 units) is confirmed lost and should be accounted for when reviewing pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 640 units in-transit. A significant portion of this pipeline (157 units from Period 2) is confirmed lost, which effectively reduces the functional pipeline to 483 units. The demand shifted around Period 6 to a higher regime; the recent average demand (P6-P11) is approximately 117 units, though P11 was lower. In-transit arrivals have been volatile (Lead times range from 1 to 3 periods). Using L=3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays and to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient safety stock. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift beginning at Period 6 while incorporating the recent variance in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Functional pipeline inventory is 483 units (640 total - 157 lost from P2). Demand since P6 has remained elevated but volatile (Avg ~117).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that the Period 2 order (157 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 11 periods. The actual pipeline inventory is 289 units (129 units from P11 and 160 from previous cycles minus the lost units). Lead times are highly volatile, swinging between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). Demand shifted around Period 6 to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P6-P12), the mean demand is 114.6 units per period, but it is volatile (range 85-165). I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed upward lead-time volatility. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 6. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to account for the increased variability observed in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Standardized pipeline inventory adjustment: Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 157) units due to the lost Period 2 order. Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in an elevated demand regime that began around Period 6. Based on recent history (P6-P13), the mean demand is approximately 113 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this regime shift while smoothing out recent volatility. The pipeline inventory currently shows 360 units, but 157 of these are from a confirmed lost shipment (Period 2), leaving an effective pipeline of 203 units. Regarding lead time, observations show a highly unstable pattern alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). By setting L to 'calculate' (average of all observations), the OR engine will use the historical mean to set base stock levels. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the backend accounts for the increased demand level and higher volatility observed in the current regime compared to the initial five periods.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 157) units due to the lost Period 2 order. Average demand in the current regime (P6-P13) is ~113 units, significantly higher than the initial P1-P5 mean of ~86 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1632.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6. Since Period 6, demand has averaged 112.9 units (P6-P14), compared to ~86 units in P1-P5. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this higher mean and volatility. The inventory situation is complicated by a lost shipment: the Period 2 order of 157 units is officially lost (it has been 13 periods since the order was placed). The current In-transit balance of 264 units consists of orders from P13 (71 units) and P14 (33 units), totaling 104 units, plus the 157 lost units. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a direct subtraction from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. Promised lead time is 2, and observed lead times fluctuate heavily between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2.22). To protect against stockouts given the volatility and the 157-unit pipeline error, I will set L to 3 and provide an explicit mu_hat that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus an additional 157 units to negate the lost shipment's impact on the order calculation.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we review the demand and lead time patterns. Demand regime shift (starting P6) remains sustained, with an average demand of approximately 114 units across the last 10 periods (P6-P15), compared to ~86 in P1-P5. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.33 periods across observed completions. The Period 2 order (157 units) is confirmed lost (14 periods since order), making the 'effective' pipeline inventory 309 units (466 total in-transit - 157 lost). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the lost shipment and the current demand level, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current regime and 'explicit' for L (value: 3) to reflect the recent tendency toward longer arrivals and to compensate for the missing pipeline units (forcing a higher base stock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 16 (demand 141 vs 139 available). The effective pipeline inventory is 284 units (In-transit 441 - 157 lost from Period 2). Demand shifted around Period 6 from a mean of ~86 to a higher level. Over the last 11 periods (P6-P16), the mean demand is 118.2 units with a standard deviation of 26.5. Lead times remain unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods; I am setting lead time L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay and covers the period until the next reliable arrival. Using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current higher demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, effectively aiming to recover from the current stockout and maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory must be calculated as (In-transit - 157) units due to the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. Demand regime (P6-P16) mean is ~118 units, up from P1-P5 mean of ~86.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. On-hand inventory is 0. The Period 17 conclude message confirms arrivals from P14 (L=3) and P16 (L=1), maintaining the pattern of volatile lead times (averaging roughly 2-3 periods). Most importantly, the shipment from Period 2 (157 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 16 periods overdue. This loss artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure on the backend. Total In-transit is listed as 505 units. Subtracting the 157 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 348 units. Demand since Period 6 has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 120 units per period. To ensure the OR backend covers the (L+1) period demand window despite the phantom inventory (157 units), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. My target base stock should cover 4 periods (L=3 plus current) at ~120 units/period (~480 units). By setting mu_hat explicitly higher (to 640), the backend's calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock - effective_pipeline) will correctly compensate for the 157-unit discrepancy (480 + 157 = 637).

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 157) units due to the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. Demand regime (P6-P17) mean is ~121 units, consistently higher than the initial P1-P5 mean of ~86.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6. Calculating mean demand from Period 6 to Period 18: (127+124+152+165+152+85+97+95+96+124+141+169+146)/13 \u2248 128.7. Initial mean (P1-P5) was 86.6. Thus, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this sustained higher demand. Regarding lead time, the promised L is 2, but observed L values are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1], averaging 2.18. Given the volatility and the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (157 units), the effective pipeline is (In-transit 713 - 157 lost) = 556 units. Since the OR backend does not know about lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' lead time L=3 to effectively increase the target base stock, providing a buffer against the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline that will never arrive. This ensures the calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a sufficient order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P6-P18) mean is ~129 units, reflecting a ~49% increase over the initial P1-P5 baseline. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude the 157 units from Period 2.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6, increasing from an initial mean of ~86 units to a current mean of ~131 units (P6-P19). Lead times are highly volatile, frequently alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2 periods), necessitating a lead time buffer of L=2 or 3. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 713 units in-transit. However, 157 units from Period 2 are definitively lost, making the effective pipeline inventory 556 units. The OR backend's default 'L' (2) and capped policy will be used, but mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=14 to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 6 to Period 19, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover current demand patterns while acknowledging the lost units and potential delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime mean stabilized at ~131 units (P6-P19), a ~52% increase from baseline. Shipment from Period 2 (157 units) is definitely lost; effective pipeline is (In-transit - 157).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 6. The mean demand for periods 6 through 20 is approximately 128 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline. Correspondingly, Period 21 begins with 0 on-hand inventory and the system experienced stockouts in periods 18, 19, and 20. The pipeline inventory is currently 713 units, but 157 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 556 units. Given the service level target (q = 19/20 = 0.95), we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand at the higher regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the sustained higher demand regime (P6-P20). Although the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; using the 'calculate' method for L\u0e08\u0e30 allow the OR backend to adapt to the observed variability while acknowledging the overall trend.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 157) units due to the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. Demand regime (P6-P20) mean is ~128 units, a ~49% increase over the initial P1-P5 baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 6 has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial periods. The mean demand for the segment P6-P21 is approximately 125 units, which is significantly higher than the P1-P5 mean of 86 units. Lead times continue to be volatile, typically alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. A critical adjustment is needed for pipeline inventory: the order from Period 2 (157 units) is confirmed lost as it hasn't arrived in 20 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports 713 units in transit. After subtracting the lost 157 units, the effective pipeline inventory is 556 units. To maintain service levels given high demand and lead time volatility, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=16 to cover the entire current regime) and sigma_hat. For lead time, I'm setting L=3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts during the frequent 3-period arrival delays.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system state at Period 23 shows 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 713 units. However, consistent history (since Period 8) confirms that 157 units ordered in Period 2 are lost, making the effective pipeline 556 units. Demand since Period 6 has shifted to a higher regime; the mean demand from Period 6 to Period 22 is 120.9 units. In the most recent periods (P18-P22), there has been a significant stockout cycle due to delayed arrivals, resulting in 0 units sold for 5 consecutive periods despite high demand. To recover from this and account for the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 17 samples (Period 6 onwards) where the mean is ~121. Given the lead time is volatile (averaging 2.3 periods but ranging 1-3), I will use the 'calculate' method for L to capture this variance. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=17) will ensure enough safety stock to handle the high demand volatility observed in the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory must subtract 157 units (Period 2 order) from the reported In-transit value. Demand regime P6-P22 mean is ~121 units (+40% vs P1-P5). Lead time is highly volatile, frequently alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. The reported in-transit inventory is 713 units, but 157 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (no arrival after 21 periods), making the effective pipeline inventory 556 units. Demand since Period 6 has shifted to a higher mean of approximately 120 units, though it is volatile. The lead time is unstable, periodically reaching 3 periods. To address the lost shipment and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout and lead-time demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat based on an expected Lead Time of 3 (L+1 = 4 periods) at the current regime average (~120), totaling 480 units. By setting L to 3 (explicit), the OR backend will calculate the order needed to reach a base stock for a 3-period lead time. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR logic doesn't under-order due to the inclusion of the lost shipment in its internal 'pipeline' calculation.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P6-P23) mean stabilized at ~120 units. Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 157) units due to the confirmed lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple periods of zero sales despite existing demand. A critical data point is the 'In-transit' value of 713 units. According to historical carry-over persistent insights, 157 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 713 - 157 = 556 units. The most recent demand regime (P6-P24) shows an average of approximately 119 units per period, but the last several periods (P19-P24) show a lower average of ~98 units. Given the massive effective pipeline (556 units) relative to recent demand, and the fact that 556 units covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand (at ~110 units/period), the OR engine must be prevented from over-ordering while awaiting these arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 (the length of the elevated regime since P6) for mu_hat to capture the broader elevated trend (~119/period) while the backend's internal cap logic manages the massive pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high volatility observed (range 1-3 periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory since Period 18 and a massive pipeline delay. A large cluster of orders placed between Period 15 and 25 (totaling 713 units in-transit) has not yet arrived. Historical lead times show high volatility, varying between 1 and 3 periods, but current data indicates a significant delay exceeding the promised lead time of 2. The Period 2 order (157 units) is confirmed lost and must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations. Recent demand (P6-P25) has averaged approximately 117 units per period, showing high volatility but stabilizing at a higher level than the initial baseline. Because there is already a massive volume of units in-transit (713 total units - 157 lost = 556 effective units) compared to the expected demand over a lead-time horizon (approx 3 * 117 = 351 units), the OR backend's capped policy will likely suppress new orders until the existing pipeline is cleared. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the detected regime (averaging the last 20 samples) and 'calculate' for L to account for the historical variability, ensuring the backend targets a base stock that covers these 556 effective units.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline stagnation detected: orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 553 units) are currently undelivered and beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods, contributing to an extended stockout.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand shifted at Period 6 from ~86 to ~120 units. However, current supply chain disruptions are the primary concern. We have 713 units 'In-transit', but 157 units (Period 2) are confirmed lost, and orders from Periods 15 (202 units), 17 (143 units), and 18 (208 units) are significantly delayed, totaling 553 units beyond their promised 2-period lead time. No arrivals have occurred since Period 17. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for L to set it to 4, reflecting the recent delivery delays. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=18 (capturing the regime from P6 to P23, excluding the most recent flat zero-order phase if relevant, though the backend uses demand samples) to account for the ~120 mean. The backend will calculate the order based on (Base Stock - Pipeline), where Pipeline includes the 713 units. Since 713 is very high, the 'explicit' L boost helps raise the base stock target to compensate for the likely lost/unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Extended supply chain failure: No arrivals observed from Period 18 to Period 26 (9 consecutive periods). Pipeline inventory of 713 units is largely unreliable, containing one confirmed lost shipment (157 units) and three severely delayed shipments (553 units total).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extended failure. No shipments have arrived since Period 17, and the last order concluded was from Period 16. The pipeline inventory of 713 units consists of: Period 2 (157 units - confirmed lost), Period 15 (202 units - severely delayed/lost), Period 17 (143 units - delayed), and Period 18 (208 units - delayed). This creates a massive disconnect between theoretical 'in-transit' units and available inventory, causing a prolonged stockout. While the backend's capped policy will limit the order size based on mean demand, I must set parameters to signal a need for replenishment while recognizing that the theoretical pipeline is full of 'phantom' inventory. Given the observed volatility and the current 10-period drought, I specify L=3 to reflect the higher end of the previously observed lead-time spectrum. mu_hat is based on the recent regime average (approx 115 units) to maintain readiness for when the logistics bottleneck clears.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals observed for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27). Reported 'In-transit' of 713 units is non-functional, consisting of one lost (P2: 157) and several severely delayed shipments totaling 556 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of systemic failure. There have been no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (since Period 17 conclude, which showed arrivals for orders from P14 and P16). The total 'In-transit' inventory of 713 units consists of: P2 (157 - lost), P15 (202 - severely delayed/lost), P17 (143 - severely delayed/lost), and P18 (208 - severely delayed/lost). The effective pipeline inventory is effectively zero as none of these units are arriving. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to a prolonged stockout while demand remains robust, averaging ~115 units over the last 10 periods. To attempt to break this stockout cycle, I must force the OR backend to place a new order. By setting L to 'explicit' at 5 (higher than the promised 2 due to observed delays) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that reflects the demand for the next (L+1) periods (6 * 115 = 690), the system should trigger a replenishment order, as the existing 713 units in 'In-transit' will be heavily discounted by the OR logic due to the high lead time and variance context, or at least be capped by the backend logic differently. Currently, the OR backend sees 'In-transit' as sufficient to cover base stock, but since these units aren't arriving, we are stuck. I will use 'explicit' values to force a re-evaluation of the base stock requirements.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals observed for 12 consecutive periods (P17-P28). Reported 'In-transit' of 713 is non-functional (P2: 157 lost, P15/17/18: 553 units severely delayed/lost).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of systemic failure, with no arrivals observed since Period 17 (13 consecutive periods). The reported 'In-transit' of 783 units is highly unreliable. It includes a confirmed lost shipment from P2 (157 units) and several severely delayed or lost shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P29 (totaling 626 units). Because the pipeline is non-functional, the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will continue to suppress new orders if we use the default lead time (L=2) because 783 >> required base stock. To force the system to attempt new procurement despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' lead time L=10. This significantly raises the base stock requirement (mu_hat calculation) and reflects the reality of the 13-period gap. Demand remains in the elevated regime (avg ~120 for P6-P29). We must place new orders to try and break the stockout, assuming any new shipment might eventually arrive even if older ones are lost.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals for 13 consecutive periods (P17-P29). Effective pipeline inventory is essentially zero as existing 'In-transit' units are likely lost or permanently stalled.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of systemic failure, with no deliveries observed for 14 consecutive periods (P17-P30). The current 'In-transit' of 948 units includes the long-lost Period 2 shipment (157 units) and multiple severely delayed orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18. Because these units are significantly past their expected arrival dates without concluding, the OR engine's standard pipeline logic will incorrectly assume sufficient or excess supply and stop ordering. To force replenishment and account for the likelihood that existing pipeline inventory is non-functional, I am setting an 'explicit' L to 10 periods to reflect the massive delay/unreliability and selecting 'recent_N' for demand parameters based on the regime starting at Period 6. Since the lead time is functionally infinite at the moment, increasing L and mu_hat is necessary to signal the backend to place new orders despite the phantom 'In-transit' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: No arrivals observed for 14 consecutive periods (P17-P30). Functional pipeline inventory is likely zero as existing 'In-transit' units are heavily stalled or lost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with no arrivals observed since Period 17 (15 consecutive periods). The total reported In-transit inventory of 1103 units includes historical orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18, which are almost certainly lost or indefinitely stalled (totaling 710 units: 157 + 202 + 143 + 208). Recent orders from P29, P30, and P31 (totaling 390 units) are within or just beyond the promised lead time of 2, but given the systemic failure, the effective pipeline inventory is treated as zero to force the OR backend to place orders. Demand since Period 6 has stabilized around a mean of 119 units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 samples to capture this regime while maintaining high service levels to recover from the prolonged stockout. Lead time is set to explicit '3' to reflect the historically observed maximum delay, though the current reality suggests a much longer interruption.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure persists: 15 consecutive periods (P17-P31) with zero arrivals. Total In-transit of 1103 contains ~710 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) that are confirmed lost/non-functional. Effective pipeline inventory is effectively zero.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, a delivery of 155 units arrived (ordered in Period 31, actual L=1). This is the first arrival since Period 17, confirming that the bottleneck has partially cleared, though historical 'In-transit' units (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18) totaling 710 units remain lost or severely stalled. The current In-transit is 948; after subtracting the 710 non-functional units, the effective pipeline is only 238 units (orders from P29 and P30). Demand remains around 120-130 units. To maintain safety stock and account for the high lead time volatility (the last arrival was L=1, but previous successes were L=3), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. mu_hat is set based on the recent regime (last 15 samples) where mean demand is approximately 115 units. sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the volatility in this period (approx 20% of mean).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery detected: Period 31 order arrived in Period 32 (L=1). However, 710 units from P2, P15, P17, and P18 remain non-functional. Effective pipeline = In-transit - 710.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown signs of recovery with a Period 31 order arriving in L=1, but the system remains precarious after a prolonged outage. Historical demand since Period 6 has stabilized around a mean of 120 units, but recent demand (P27-P33) shows a slight uptick (~122 units). The In-transit inventory of 948 units includes approximately 710 units (from P2, P15, P17, and P18) that are statistically lost or permanently stalled, making them non-functional for meeting future demand. Only approximately 238 units (orders from P29-P30) are potentially viable. Given the backend use of a Base Stock policy, setting L to 'explicit' at 3 periods provides a buffer against the high lead-time volatility observed (1-3 periods) and the risk of further disruptions. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 samples (N=20) to capture the higher demand regime that began around Period 6, while smoothing through the recent stockout noise. This ensures the backend targets a base stock that accounts for the elevated demand and lead-time risks.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed Period 32 (L=1 arrival), ending a 15-period outage. However, 710 units from P2, P15, P17, and P18 are non-functional; effective pipeline = In-transit - 710.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has emerged from a 15-period outage, with a recent arrival in Period 32 (L=1). However, 710 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed as non-functional (Period 2: 157; Period 15: 202; Period 17: 143; Period 18: 208). Total In-transit is 948, but the effective pipeline is only 238 units (948 - 710). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 6, with a recent mean (P29-P34) of approximately 106 units. To compensate for the 710 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are coming, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the demand for (L+1) periods plus the 710 missing units. This forces the engine to place an order that restores the actual base stock level. I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation basis for mu_hat: (L+1)*110 + 710 = 1040. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure resolved in P32, but 710 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed lost/non-functional; effective pipeline calculation must always subtract 710 units from reported In-transit.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with an arrival in Period 32 (L=1), following a 15-period outage. However, 710 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline from early periods (P2, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed non-functional. The reported In-transit is 1088; excluding the 710 lost units, the effective pipeline is 378 units. These units represent orders from P29 (70), P30 (165), and P35 (140). Demand since P29 has averaged ~100 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and the next significant arrivals (P29/P30) expected shortly, I will set mu_hat based on the recent regime (last 10 periods, avg ~112) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period. I'll use L=2 (promised) as the base for calculations while the system stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed in P32 (L=1), but 710 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) remain lost; effective pipeline = In-transit - 710.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a severe multi-period outage (P17-P31). While the 'In-transit' balance is 1088 units, 710 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed lost or non-functional, leaving an effective pipeline of 378 units. The order of 140 units from P35 should arrive in P37 (L=2) or P38. Recent demand has cooled slightly compared to the mid-game peak, but remains significantly higher than the initial P1-P5 baseline. I'm using the recent 14 periods (P23-P36) to capture the current demand regime, which averages ~107 units. Setting L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals show recovery. mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned using the recent regime to ensure the OR backend orders enough to rebuild on-hand inventory while accounting for the stalled pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed since P32; lead times are returning to promised levels. However, effective pipeline inventory must permanently subtract 710 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) from the reported In-transit value to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive 15-period outage (P17-P31). Recent arrivals (P32 with L=1, P37 with L=2) indicate that lead times have returned to the promised range of 1-2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' level of 948 units is heavily inflated by 710 units from P2, P15, P17, and P18 that are confirmed lost or permanently stalled. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these phantom units and under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Demand in the post-outage regime (P32-P37) averages ~102 units. Using an (L+1) horizon with L=2, the target base stock must cover 3 periods of demand (~306 units). Given the effective pipeline is actually (948 - 710) = 238 units and on-hand is 17, placing an order to reach the target is necessary. I will set mu_hat to 310 to ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the regime mean and the inventory inflation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major breakdown, with recent lead times being 1 (P32) and 2 (P37). However, the system reports an 'In-transit' of 948 units, which includes 710 units from P2, P15, P17, and P18 that are confirmed lost or non-functional. To prevent the OR backend from severely under-ordering, I must subtract these 710 units from the functional pipeline. Since the backend doesn't allow direct adjustment of pipeline inventory, I set L=0 and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force a base stock calculation that reflects the remaining 238 functional units (948 total - 710 lost). The demand regime remains elevated with high volatility; the mean demand for the last 10 periods (P29-P38) is approximately 117 units. I set mu_hat to 120 and sigma_hat to 35 to provide enough safety stock to cover the current stockout and expected demand until the next arrival.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in P32, but 710 units (from orders in P2, P15, P17, P18) remain non-functional. Functional pipeline = In-transit - 710.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive outage between periods 17 and 31. Recent arrivals (P31 order in P32, L=1; P35 order in P37, L=2) indicate that the actual lead time has returned to near-promised levels (range 1-2 periods). However, the reported 'In-transit' inventory of 948 units is highly misleading. Based on historical data, 710 units are confirmed lost/non-functional (Period 2: 157; Period 15: 202; Period 17: 143; Period 18: 208). Subtracting these 710 'ghost' units from the current In-transit (948) leaves a functional pipeline of 238 units (likely encompassing orders from P29-P31 that might still trickle in, though P29/P30 are becoming overdue). Demand for the current regime (P32-P39) averages ~114 units, slightly lower than the P6-P31 average but with rising volatility in the last three periods (152, 134). I will use L=2 and demand parameters reflecting the current regime (last 8 periods) to ensure we rebuild stock levels while accounting for the non-functional pipeline inventory to trigger necessary ordering through the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability confirmed post-outage with observed lead times of 1-2 periods since P32. Functional pipeline inventory must subtract 710 units (P2, P15, P17, P18) from reported In-transit.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-outage, with recent lead times of 1 and 2 periods (P32 and P37). However, the reported 'In-transit' inventory of 948 units includes 710 units from orders in P2, P15, P17, and P18 that are confirmed lost or non-functional. The effective pipeline is therefore only 238 units (948 - 710). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this inflated pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Current demand regime (P29-P40) average is ~113 units. I will set mu_hat based on (1 + L) * 113. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 113 = 339. Given the recent variability in demand (std dev approx 21), sigma_hat is set to sqrt(3) * 21 \u2248 36. This configuration forces the backend to recognize the need for new stock given the 0 on-hand and 0 functional in-transit yesterday.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-outage, but a critical inventory discrepancy exists: 710 units (from orders in Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18) are considered permanently lost or non-functional. The backend OR engine sees an In-transit value of 948 units, which lead it to believe the pipeline is full. However, the functional pipeline is actually 948 - 710 = 238 units. To force the OR engine to order sufficiently to cover upcoming demand and restock the currently empty on-hand inventory, I am setting 'mu_hat' explicitly. I estimate demand based on the post-outage regime (approx. 120 units/period). For a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3), the base stock should be ~360 units plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat to a high explicit value, I compensate for the phantom 710 units in the pipeline that the OR engine would otherwise subtract from its order calculation.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times returning to 1-2 periods, though we must continue to account for 710 units of non-functional 'In-transit' inventory (from Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18). Demand is currently elevated, with a mean of approximately 120-130 units over the current regime. For Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline is 1164 units, but the functional pipeline is only 454 units (1164 - 710). Since the previous order of 216 units in Period 42 hasn't arrived yet (expected Period 43 or 44), and we are at zero stock, a robust base stock level is required. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained higher demand regime (averaging ~120). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the post-outage arrivals (P31, P35) have shown 1-2 period lead times, which aligns with the promised 2 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1-2 periods since recovery in Period 32. Current demand (P40-P43) averages ~132 units, reflecting a peak/high-demand regime. The primary challenge is the inflated 'In-transit' balance of 1164 units, which includes 710 units from confirmed lost or permanently stalled orders (Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting an explicit 'mu_hat' that compensates for the lost units. The goal is to ensure the backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~396 units) plus a safety buffer, while effectively ignoring the 710 non-functional units in the engine's internal calculation (base_stock - pipeline). By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100, the capped policy will trigger an order that fills the current stockout and builds a small buffer, despite the 1164 in-transit report.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1-3 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 0, with a reported in-transit of 1184 units. However, as established in prior periods, 710 units (from orders in P2, P15, P17, and P18) are confirmed lost or non-functional. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 1184 - 710 = 474 units. Recent demand (P40-P44) has averaged 131.8 units, reflecting the higher regime observed since P6. To prevent stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture this recent volatility (Avg ~133), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current demand variance. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance of the recovered supply chain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2364.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we have 87 units on-hand and 968 units in-transit. Based on extensive historical evidence, 710 units in-transit (from Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost or non-functional. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 258 units (968 - 710). The supply chain has stabilized post-recovery with lead times of 1-3 periods (most recent arrival from P42 had L=3). I will use L=3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts. Demand since the recovery phase (P32 onwards) has averaged approximately 119 units, with recent volatility. I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-outage demand regime (P32-P45). Setting L to 3 ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the current period plus the 3-period lead time, while the OR logic will handle the pipeline subtraction using the provided 'In-transit' value (note: the OR engine will see 968, so my choice of parameters must ensure the order is high enough despite the engine's overestimation of 'In-transit' availability).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with observed lead times of 1-3 periods since recovering in Period 32. However, a total of 710 units (from orders in Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost or non-functional. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 968 units includes these 710 units, meaning the functional pipeline is only 258 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will set an explicit lead time L=3 and use 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the current demand regime (P29-P46) shows a mean of approximately 125 units, I'll set mu_hat = (1+L) * 125 = 500. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation in this regime is approximately 22, so I'll set an explicit value of sqrt(1+L) * 22 \u2248 44 to maintain a high service level.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-outage, with recent lead times being 1 period (P31), 2 periods (P35), and 3 periods (P42), averaging to 2 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a sustained higher level compared to the start of the game. Over the last 15 periods (P33-P47), demand has averaged approximately 115.8 units, though recent periods show higher volatility. The 'In-transit' figure of 968 units includes 710 units from P2, P15, P17, and P18 which are confirmed lost/non-functional. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 258 units (968 - 710). Since the game ends at Period 50 and it is currently Period 48, orders placed now with a lead time of 2-3 periods will likely arrive just as the game concludes or afterward. However, to maximize profit from the remaining periods and given the current 0 on-hand status, maintaining the base stock calculation is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (Mean ~116, Std Dev ~26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 120-130 units since Period 6. The most recent demand samples reflect this level (P45-P48: 129, 140, 76, 128). The supply chain has recovered from the major outage, with observed lead times of 1-3 periods (P32: L=1, P37: L=2, P45: L=3). However, the system reports an 'In-transit' of 968 units, which includes 710 units from orders in Period 2 (157), Period 15 (202), Period 17 (143), and Period 18 (208) that are confirmed lost or permanently stalled. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that bypasses the logic of (In-transit - 710). Since the on-hand is 0 and only ~258 actual units are in transit (968-710), I set mu_hat to a value that covers expected demand for the lead period plus safety stock, effectively forcing an order. Given P50 is the final period, the goal is to maximize sales while minimizing ending inventory. I estimate demand at ~125 per period. For L=2, demand over L+1 is ~375. With functional pipeline ~258, a mu_hat of ~600 will trigger a sufficient order.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-disruption with observed lead times for concluding orders (P31, P35, P42) being 1, 2, and 3 periods respectively. The current in-transit inventory is 968 units. However, as established in prior carry-over insights, 710 units in the pipeline (orders from P2, P15, P17, and P18) are confirmed lost or non-functional. Therefore, the effective functional pipeline is only 258 units (968 - 710). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been volatile but remains elevated within the post-P6 regime; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is 125.1 units. To avoid a significant stockout given the 0 on-hand balance and the high ratio of non-functional pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the recent 10-period average to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat is set based on the same period to account for recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times (averaging ~2) rather than the promised 2.
