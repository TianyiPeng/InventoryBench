Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods of 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 100.4 units (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) with a standard deviation of approximately 22.3. Given the Lead Time (L=2), the target pipeline inventory (base stock) should cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. Using the 'default' methods, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*100.4 = 301.2 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+2)*22.3 = 38.6. This is a reasonable starting point while we wait for more current performance data and lead-time confirmation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (138 units) is currently in-transit, as the promised lead time is 2 periods. We expect it to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 4. Starting on-hand was 0 in Period 1, and demand was 89, resulting in 89 lost sales. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those not yet 'concluded' in the game history) shows a mean of 100.4 and a standard deviation of 22.8. Since total lead time is 2, the review+lead period covers 3 units of time (L+1). My goal is to set parameters that cover demand until the next order can arrive. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial behavior of the SKU.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 273 units in transit (138 from P1, 135 from P2). Demand for the first two periods was 89 and 107. Since lead time is 2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. The historical demand samples provided (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) have a mean of 100.4. Using N=5 for demand captures the most relevant local mean while we wait for lead time confirmation. I will use the default lead time (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (138 units) are expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution (visible at the start of P4) or P4's arrival resolution (visible at the start of P5). Since the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', the order from P1 did not arrive within 2 periods (L=2 would mean arrive in P3). This suggests either a lead time of 3+ periods or a lost shipment. However, per the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order with L=2 placed in P1 arrives DURING P3 and is visible in the P3 conclude message. Since P3 conclude shows 0 arrived, the actual lead time is likely > 2. I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for this delay and increase the base stock. Demand calculation (mu_hat) will use recent_N=3 to capture the upward trend in demand (89, 107, 129).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 periods is 89, 107, 129, 75, and 134 (mean \u2248 107). Inventory management is critical as lead times have shown significant volatility. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3's order arrived in only 1 period (Period 4). This suggests highly variable logistics. Currently, we have 100 on-hand and 259 in-transit. Period 2's order of 135 units is still pending; based on Period 1's lead time of 3, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (visible in P6). Setting L to 'calculate' lets the OR backend use the observed average of (3+1)/2 = 2. Mu_hat is set to 321 (approx 3 * 107) using the mean of all 5 samples to smooth out the volatility. Sigma_hat defaults to the standard deviation of all samples to reflect the observed demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period (Average L=2). Demand mean stable around 107.

Daily Profit: $93.00, Daily Holding Cost: $7.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing regular chips with a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand from Periods 1-5 (74, 108, 88, 98, 134 - based on provided samples) or calculated from game history (89, 107, 129, 75, 93) shows a mean around 100 with moderate volatility. Lead time behavior is inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period, averaging to the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) while 301 units are in transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since the total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) of 308 units covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~100/period), the OR backend's base-stock calculation should aim to maintain this coverage. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the latest fluctuations (N=5) and set L to calculate to reflect the observed mean lead time behavior. Sigma will be set to recent_N (N=5) to account for recent demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (sold only 7 units against a demand of 92). Total in-transit is 388 units (orders from P2=135, P4=124, P5=42, P6=87). Looking at lead time history: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. The average is indeed the promised 2 periods, but volatility is high. The order from P2 (135 units) is now overdue if L=2, as it should have arrived in P4 or P5; since it didn't arrive by the end of P6, there is a risk it is delayed or lost. However, assuming the mean lead time is still 2, the pipeline is quite large (388 units) relative to recent demand. Demand samples (89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92) show a mean of ~97.5. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand stability (avg ~92 over last 3 periods) and the default calculate method for L to account for the observed variance. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Stockout occurred (ending inventory 0, 85 units lost demand). P2 order (135 units) is potentially delayed (3 periods since order).

Daily Profit: $87.00, Daily Holding Cost: $37.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Looking at the history, the demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable, with an average around 97 units over the last 7 periods (excluding the stockout period where demand measurement might be slightly skewed, though history shows demand of 89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87). Lead times are volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3. The promised lead time is 2. Critically, the order from Period 2 (135 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P2, currently P8 start), which strongly suggests it is lost. The order from Period 5 (42 units) is also at its promised L=2 limit. Current on-hand is low (37). Pipeline inventory is 273, but if P2 (135) is lost, effective pipeline is only 138. To prevent further stockouts given lead time uncertainty (L can be 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (mean of [3, 1, 3] = 2.33). I'll use recent_N for demand (N=7) to capture the stable mean of ~97. This will raise the base stock to cover roughly 3.33 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (135 units) confirmed as lost shipment (6 periods elapsed since order). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 and just experienced another stockout in Period 8. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of 97.4 over 8 periods. Lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2). The order from Period 2 (135 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 7 periods overdue. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 296 units in-transit (P6 order: 87, P8 order: 74, possibly others). Since we are currently stocked out and lead time is unstable, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture recent levels (~94 avg) and maintain the default lead time of 2 as the central estimate. Given the recent stockouts, I will use a slightly larger N for sigma to account for the volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 16 and in-transit is 222 (from Period 6 and 9 orders). Observed lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). The average lead time is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0. The order from Period 2 is confirmed lost. Demand recently dropped to 58 in Period 9, but the historical mean remains around 93. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, lead-time uncertainty and the lost order in history suggest we should provide a robust estimate for volatility and demand to prevent further stockouts like those seen in Period 6 and 8. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the current mean while specifying a calculated lead time to reflect the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility pattern confirmed: alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Avg 2.0). Demand mean stable at 93 across 9 periods despite Period 9 dip.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11, the product is currently stocked out (on-hand 0). Analysis of lead times reveals a high-variance pattern: orders arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). Order P2 is confirmed lost. The current in-transit inventory is 341 units, likely consisting of orders from P6 (87 units), P10 (119 units), and potentially others recently placed. Given the stockout in P10 and high demand variability (ranging 58-129), I will use a recent_N approach for demand. Demand from the last 5 periods (92, 87, 108, 58, 110) averages ~91. For lead time, I will stick with the promised L=2 (default), as the actual average remains 2.0 (12/6 concluded orders). The OR backend's service level logic (q=0.5 where Profit=HoldingCost) will naturally aim for a 50% service level, but I will use recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility and prevent excessive stockouts given the recent stockout history.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, we are in a serious stockout situation (on-hand: 0). Looking at history, demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~98.6 over 11 periods), but lead-time volatility is the primary challenge. Observed lead times are: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1), P8 (1). This confirms the 'alternating/volatile' pattern between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.0. Crucially, orders from P10 (119 units) and potentially P6 (87 units - now 6 periods ago, likely lost) are missing. P6 is almost certainly lost given P8 and P7 orders arrived. I will set L to 2 (the average). For mu_hat, the 11-period average is 98.6; using (1+L)*mean = 3 * 98.6 = 295.8. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation is ~22.6; using sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(3)*22.6 = 39.1. The backend OR will calculate a base stock around these values. With 341 units in transit (likely including the missing P10 order), the OR logic may not order much, but setting parameters to reflect the full demand distribution and the 3-period maximum lead time possibility helps manage future service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 6 (87 units) confirmed as lost shipment (6 periods elapsed). Lead time remains confirmed as volatile (range 1-3, mean 2.0). Demand regime remains stable with mean ~99.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (excluding the zero-sales periods from stockouts) shows a stable mean. Calculating from the recorded demand samples (Period 1-12): Mean ~99.3, Std Dev ~23.4. The lead time continues to show significant volatility (1 to 3 periods), though the most recent arrival (P10 order arriving at P12) matched the promised lead time of 2. We have experienced two lost shipments (Orders from P2 and P6), which necessitates a slightly more conservative safety stock approach to buffer against future delivery failures. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (24), and we are waiting on a large in-transit volume (249 units). We'll set L to the promised lead time of 2 (default) as the average is also ~2.0, but we will use recent demand history (N=12) to estimate mu and sigma to capture the current regime's volatility and mean appropriately.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a current pipeline of 272 units (likely from orders in P11-P13). The 'Period 13 conclude' shows a stockout, with demand (122) significantly exceeding on-hand supply (24). Historical analysis shows lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.0. Demand over the last 13 periods (plus initial samples) remains relatively stable with a mean around 99 units. Since there are currently 272 units in-transit (covering roughly 2.7 periods of demand) and the system has already hit the order cap in recent periods due to stockouts, I will use lead time 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the most recent mean (~98) while smoothing out the volatility seen in Period 11 (138) and Period 9 (58). This strategy aims to build back safety stock while the OR backend manages the pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently experiencing a stockout due to arrivals from Periods 11-14 not yet landing. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with arrivals often clustering or being lost (Periods 2 and 6 orders were lost). Current in-transit inventory is 365, comprising orders from P11 (0 reported, but likely 0 ordered), P12 (27), P13 (23), and P14 (93). Demand remains relatively stable, averaging ~98 units over the last 14 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and are awaiting arrivals, I will maintain parameters based on recent performance. The mean demand across (1+L) periods where L=2 is roughly 3*98 = 294. I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma to capture the slightly higher demand volatility seen in recent periods (95, 122, 116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Looking at history, lead times for chips(Regular) are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P12 took 3, P10 took 2, P8 took 1). Order shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost. Current in-transit is 338 units, consisting of orders from P13 (23 units), P14 (93 units), and presumably a large order from P15 or similar. Demand mean over the last 15 periods is approximately 100 units. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the target critical ratio q = 0.5, which aligns with the base stock being the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). Given recent stockouts and lead time volatility, I will use a conservative average lead time of 2.0 based on recent results and recent demand history (N=10) to calculate mu_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets approximately 3 periods of demand to recover from the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable around a mean of 101 units (last 5 periods actual: 95, 122, 116, 93, 95). We have experienced significant lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6 orders). Specifically, the order from Period 14 (93 units) is currently at its promised lead time (2 periods), and the order from Period 16 (25 units) was just placed. There are 340 units in-transit total, but given historical losses, the pipeline reliability is a concern. To prevent stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=10) for demand filtering to capture the current stable regime (~101/period). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (mean ~2.1 periods), which accounts for the frequent 3-period arrivals. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level which requires precise parameterization to avoid excessive holding costs while recovering from the current 0 on-hand state.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand remains relatively stable, with the mean across all 17 periods being approximately 98 (excluding initial seed data). The recent demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17) averages 104, suggesting a stable regime. Inventory management is challenged by lead-time volatility: historical lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average 2.0). Currently, we have 24 units on-hand and 247 units in-transit. The in-transit units consist of orders from Period 15 (potential loss) and Period 17. Given the high stockout frequency (Periods 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 all saw ending inventory 0 or very low), we must maintain a robust base stock. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to capture the average actual lead time (approx 2). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand mean (approx 105 per period) while applying the (1+L) multiplier to cover the review and lead time. This approach ensures we account for both current demand levels and the lead-time offset.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 19. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 18 was 59, following a stretch of 5 periods averaging ~91. The historical mean starting from Period 1 is approximately 99.7. Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2 across the valid concluded orders. We currently have 344 units in-transit (ordered in P17, P18, and P19 previously, though the history shows P17-P18 orders total 122). Specifically, orders from P17 (25 units) and P18 (97 units) are in-transit. I will rely on recent demand (last 10 periods) to set mu_hat, which captures the high demand spikes (P11, P13, P14) and recent dips (P18). Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level offset by the buffer logic. Since on-hand is 0, we need the OR engine to trigger an order to cover the pipeline gap for the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stockout (on-hand: 0). Demand across the last 19 periods has stabilized around a mean of 99.8 units/period. Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an observed average of 2.1 periods. There is massive pipeline inventory (351 units) which includes orders from P17 (25), P18 (97), P19 (7), and the pending restock from the current cycle. Order P17 (placed in Period 17, 3 periods ago) should arrive during Period 20's arrival phase. Given the high stockout frequency and lead time volatility, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the current variability. N=15 for mu_hat is used to cover the stable regime observed since Period 5, while L=calculate will use all available history to average out the 1-3 period swings.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Persistent demand stability confirmed (mean ~100). Lead-time volatility remains the primary risk factor, consistently swinging between extreme values (1 and 3 periods).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21. On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 354 units in transit (ordered in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20). Historical analysis shows a stable demand mean (approx. 100 units/period) but significant lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods) and occasional lost shipments (P2 and P6 orders). Specifically, orders from P17 (25 units) and P18 (97 units) have not arrived yet; since P17 was ordered 4 periods ago, it is increasingly at risk of being lost or significantly delayed, similar to past patterns. The backend OR logic uses q = 0.5 (since Profit=Holding=$1), which targets a 50% service level. Given the high stockout frequency in the history (on-hand 0 in many periods), the goal is to stabilize the base stock around the demand sum of (L+1) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand to capture the stable regime of ~100/period while smoothing the Period 9/18 dips. For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to reflect the observed average of ~2.0, as explicit lead-time shifts are volatile rather than sustained at a new level.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory and 361 units in-transit. The game history shows a pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6) and significant lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods). Crucially, we have seen no arrivals for the last 4 periods (P18-P21), meaning orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20 are still pending. The order from P17 (ordered 25 units) is now 4 periods old, which is concerning but not yet definitively lost based on the 6-period rule established in carry-over insights. Demand has remained stable around 100 units/period. The current in-transit (361) is high compared to the target pipeline (avg demand ~100 * (L+1) = 300). However, because we are at 0 on-hand and have experienced stockouts, we need to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that accounts for both the mean demand and the high volatility. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the most stable recent regime while the OR backend manages the safety stock via the service level z-score (profit/holding cost = 0.5, which implies a moderate safety stock level).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and a significant backlog of missing or delayed shipments. Analyzing the history: Orders from Period 17 (25 units), Period 18 (97 units), Period 19 (7 units), Period 20 (3 units), and Period 21 (7 units) are all currently in-transit. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, lead time is volatile (1-3 periods). A major concern is the sequence of Periods 18-22 where no arrivals occurred despite orders being placed, suggesting either a cluster of maximum lead times (L=3) or further lost shipments. Demand remains stable with a long-term mean of ~99. Given the persistent stockouts and pipeline uncertainty, I will maintain the lead time (L) at the promised 2 (as 'calculate' would be skewed by losses) and use a recent_N of 22 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full regime of stable but high-variance demand (~100 units/period). The service level target (q) by the OR backend (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1) = 0.5) naturally aims for a 50% service level; given the current stockout and transit risks, the parameters must ensure the pipeline is adequately filled to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a significant inventory shortage with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple periods of lost sales. While 351 units are in-transit, recent arrivals (Period 23) show extremely small quantities (3 and 7 units) relative to demand, which has remained stable with a mean of ~100. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods (Average 2.0), but a major concern is the gap in arrivals from orders placed in Periods 17, 18, and 19. Period 17 (25 units), Period 18 (97 units), and Period 19 (7 units) are currently 6, 5, and 4 periods old respectively; the Period 18 order is particularly critical given its size. I will maintain L at the default (promised 2) since the average observed is 2.0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 to reflect the stable demand regime (~100/period) while accounting for the recent volatility. The OR backend will see the 351 units in-transit and 0 on-hand; by setting L=2 and mu_hat based on N=10, the base stock will aim to cover demand for 3 periods (L+1).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 status check: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained stable throughout the game, with a mean around 100 units (98.3 over 24 periods). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility and lost/delayed shipments. The in-transit pipeline (351 units) consists of orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 23. Orders from Periods 17 (25 units) and 18 (97 units) are currently 8 and 7 periods past their order date, respectively. Given the history of lost shipments (P2 and P6), these are likely lost. Order P19 (7 units) is 6 periods out and also likely lost. This leaves essentially only P23 (0 units ordered) and the base pipeline from previous weeks. However, the system shows 351 units 'In-transit', suggesting the backend still counts those potentially lost orders. To protect against stockouts caused by these 'phantom units' in the pipeline, I will use an explicit L=3 (the observed upper bound of lead time) and a mu_hat based on the stable demand mean of ~100. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand, accounting for the frequent 3-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Orders from Period 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 129 units) are highly likely lost as they are 6+ periods overdue (max observed L is 3). Total pipeline 'In-transit' of 351 is likely inflated by these lost units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: We are entering after a series of stockouts and likely lost shipments. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with a mean around 100 units. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 392, which includes multiple likely lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 17 (25 units), Period 18 (97 units), and Period 19 (7 units) are now 7-9 periods old (max observed L is 3). These 129 units, plus potentially the order from Period 15 (which never arrived) and others beyond the 3nd period, should be discounted from 'pipeline inventory'. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock; if the in-transit is inflated by ghost units that will never arrive, it will under-order, perpetuating stockouts. By setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 (the high end of the volatility range) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering the stable regime), we aim to force a higher base stock. Specifically for mu_hat, 100 units/period * (L+1=4) = 400. However, because the backend logic 'base_stock - pipeline' is fixed, and 'pipeline' is currently 392, an order will only trigger if base_stock > 392. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for the fact that ~129 units in 'In-transit' are likely lost, essentially targeting a base stock that covers the lead time plus the lost units to force the system to replenish.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed 129 units in pipeline (from Periods 17, 18, 19) are lost (6+ periods overdue). In-transit is significantly inflated, causing OR backend to under-order.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 27 with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout situation. Pipeline inventory is reported as 530 units, but historical evidence from Period 26 and carry-over insights confirms that 129 units from Periods 17, 18, and 19 are lost shipments (6-9 periods overdue). This reduces the effective pipeline to 401 units. However, recent demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean 99.3 over the last 15 periods). The OR backend uses reported 'In-transit' (530) to calculate orders, which leads to severe under-ordering if not corrected. Since I cannot change the 'In-transit' value directly, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to force-feed a base stock that accounts for both the expected lead time (avg 2, plus review period = 3 periods of demand) and the phantom units in the pipeline. Targeting a base stock that covers these 3 periods (~300 units) plus a safety buffer, while offsetting the ~129 lost units, requires an explicit mu_hat setting. I will set L to 2 (observed average) and mu_hat to 450 to ensure the OR engine places a significant order to break the stockout cycle, as the current pipeline view is too optimistic.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 530 units 'In-transit'. However, based on the lead-time analysis (max Observed L=3), orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, 20 (3 units), and 21 (7 units - though technically arrived P23) that haven't arrived are likely lost. Specifically, orders from P17 (25), P18 (97), and P19 (7) totaling 129 units are definitely lost (now 8+ periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' of 530 includes these lost units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must specify a high explicit mu_hat. Demand remains steady with a mean of ~99. Current real pipeline consists of P25 (41 units) and P26 (138 units), totaling 179 units. To clear the stockout and cover future demand (L+1 periods), I will set mu_hat explicitly high to trigger an order that compensates for the lost units trapped in the system's pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total of 129 units from Periods 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed lost. System 'In-transit' (530) is inflated by at least these 129 units plus likely subsequent late-period orders that have exceeded L=3. Actual reliable pipeline is 179 units (P25, P26).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure (392) is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Analysis: P17 (25 units), P18 (97 units), and P19 (7 units) are clearly lost (over 9 periods overdue vs. max L=3). P20 and P21 arrived in P23. P25 (41 units) and P26 (138 units, already arrived) are accounted for. This leaves approximately 129 units (P17-P19) plus potentially P27-P28 'unseen' orders (though none were placed) as ghost inventory. Due to this inflation, the OR backend is under-ordering, causing stockouts. To correct this, I am manually increasing mu_hat using 'explicit' to calculate a base stock that ignores the ghost inventory. Demand is stable at mean=100. For L=2 and demand=100, target inventory should be around (L+1)*mean = 300. Current reliable pipeline is ~41 units (P25). On-hand is 51. Total reliable current assets = 92. I will set mu_hat explicitly to force an order that bridges this gap while accounting for volatility. Setting mu_hat to 450 (effectively target inventory) over (L+1) periods to ensure the OR engine triggers a sufficient order despite the 392 'In-transit' value.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Systemic under-ordering confirmed due to 129 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P17-P19) inflating the pipeline. Manual mu_hat adjustment required to bypass OR backend's inventory calculation until these units are cleared or offset.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' of 399 units. However, multiple orders are confirmed lost or severely overdue based on the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods: P17 (25), P18 (97), P19 (7), P20 (3), and P21 (7) totaling 139 units. Additionally, orders P25 (41) and P26 (already arrived) are 4+ periods old. The effective reliable pipeline is drastically lower than 399. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the calculated base stock, it will continue to under-order or not order at all while we stock out. Average demand remains steady at approximately 100 units per period. To force the backend to place a restorative order, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a target base stock that treats the 399 units as mostly 'ghost' inventory. Targeting covering 3 periods of demand (1 current + 2 lead time) at 100 units/each plus buffer, minus the actual reliable inventory (estimated at near 0 on-hand and negligible reliable arrivals), I set mu_hat high to bypass the pipeline deduction logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Reliable pipeline estimation confirms 'ghost inventory' from lost orders P17-P21 (139 units) and likely P25 (41 units) persists, causing 180+ units of deviation in OR inventory tracking.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from severe stockouts due to 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. The OR backend observes 'In-transit: 550 units', but our analysis confirms that 139 units (from Periods 17-19, 21) and likely the order from Period 25 (41 units) are lost, as they are 5+ periods overdue (max L=3). This means ~180 units in the pipeline tracking are non-existent. Period 30 ended with 0 inventory and 123 lost demand. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently despite the inflated pipeline, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I'm targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand for the lead time (L+1=3) plus a safety buffer, while effectively 'adding back' the 180 units lost. Mean demand is ~100. Base stock targets around 400-450. Since the backend subtracts the (likely false) 550 pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap or a significant replenishment. However, the OR backend logic is capped at mu_hat/(1+L) + z*sigma_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand regime while maximizing the allowable order cap.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total lost units in pipeline reached approximately 180 units (lost orders from P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P25). This creates a permanent gap between 'In-transit' and actual arrivals, necessitating manual mu_hat overrides to ensure product flow.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains extremely critical. On-hand inventory is 0, and despite an 'In-transit' figure of 650 units, a substantial portion is 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely overdue orders. Confirmed losses include P17-P21 (139 units) and likely P25 (41 units), totaling 180 units. Additionally, orders from P29 (7 units), P30 (151 units), and P31 (100 units) are currently within or just past the volatile lead time window (max L=3). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a deduction from the base stock. With 0 on-hand and an inflated in-transit balance (likely undercounting valid arrivals), the OR engine will under-order. To force the engine to place an order despite the 650 units in 'In-transit', I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 800. This value is significantly higher than the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 300) to offset the ~200+ lost units and clear the pipeline of 'ghost' inventory, ensuring the service level is prioritized to end the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Systemic under-ordering continues due to 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P17-P21, P25). In-transit of 650 is inflated by at least 180-200 units. Explicit mu_hat override is maintained to force order flow through the stockout.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from 'ghost inventory' caused by lost orders (P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P25), which total approximately 181 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (700) but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to under-order significantly as it believes the pipeline is full. Demand remains stable with a mean of ~100. To bypass the backend's flawed inventory tracking logic, I am maintaining an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L)*mean + ghost_offset. With L=2, (1+L)*100 = 300. Adding the 181 ghost units as an offset brings mu_hat to 481. This forces the system to place orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=20 to capture the actual volatility of the demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Ghost inventory remains steady at ~181 units (Orders P17-P21, P25). In-transit (700) overstates actual incoming stock by 25.8%. Continued use of explicit mu_hat with ~180 unit offset is necessary until these orders are purged from the system window.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) which inflates the pipeline and suppresses orders. Confirmed lost units: P17 (25), P18 (97), P19 (7), P20 (3 - arrived P23), P21 (7 - arrived P23), P25 (41). Total lost units from P17-P19 and P25 is 170 units. Current In-transit is 550, but actual reliable pipeline (P30, P34 orders) is much lower. Since P31 (100) and P32 (150) arrived, and P33 was 0, the remaining in-transit likely includes P30 (151) and older lost stock. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, I must continue using an explicit mu_hat. Mean demand is stable around 100 per period. With L=2, the required 'pipeline stock' should be (1+L)*demand = 300. However, the OR backend sees 550 in-transit + 57 on-hand (Total 607) and will order 0 unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the ~180 units of ghost inventory. I'll set mu_hat to 480 (standard 300 + 180 offset) to ensure replenishment continues while we have on-hand stock.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) that artificially inflate the 'In-transit' figure, currently at 550 units. Based on historical data, shipments from P17-P21 and P25 (approx. 181 units) are long-lost, and more recent gaps suggest additional losses or severe delays. The demand mean remains stable around 100 units. To bypass the OR backend's logic, which subtracts 'In-transit' from a calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated to effectively force an order despite the phantom pipeline: Targeted Base Stock (L+1 period coverage for L=2) = 300 units. Since OR uses [base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat], setting mu_hat slightly above the desired coverage while using 'default' sigma ensures the order volume remains steady. I have reduced the 'explicit' mu_hat slightly from previous periods to account for the recent arrivals (P31, P32), but I must maintain a high enough trigger to overcome the 550 units of recorded (but mostly fake) in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory persists; In-transit (550) is heavily inflated by approximately 200+ units of lost or severely overdue orders (P17-P21, P25, P30). Explicit mu_hat methodology remains necessary to counteract systemic under-ordering.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant disruption from 'ghost inventory'\u2014lost orders (P17-P21, P25, P30) that remain in the 'In-transit' count (550) but will never arrive. These lost units total approximately 200+ units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock target, it will under-order or not order at all, despite zero on-hand inventory and consistent demand (mean ~100). To counteract this, I am maintaining an 'explicit' mu_hat of 600. This is calculated as: (Target Demand for L+1 periods) + (Offset for Lost Inventory). With Mean Demand ~100 and Promised L=2 (L+1=3), the base demand requirement is ~300. Adding the ~200-300 units of 'ghost inventory' creates a target that forces the backend to place an order to cover current stockouts. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead time (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total ghost inventory (lost orders P17-P21, P25, P30) estimated at 200-250 units. This value remains constant in the 'In-transit' field but will not conclude, requiring sustained explicit mu_hat overrides to maintain stock flow.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory tracking discrepancy due to 'ghost inventory'\u2014lost orders from Period 17-21, 25, and 30 that remain in the 'In-transit' field but will never arrive. The current total in-transit is 600 units, but approximately 200-250 of these are verified as lost (over 6 periods since ordering, where max L=3). To maintain stock flow, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Mean demand is stable around 100 units. A standard base stock for L=2 would be roughly 300 units ((1+2) * 100). However, because the backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' (600) from this base stock, it would result in zero orders. To force an order that covers (~2-3 periods of demand) despite this pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 850. This effectively signals to the backend that we need more units to offset the 600 ghost units and still reach a target on-hand level. This acts as a manual override to ensure we don't remain in a perpetual stockout while the ghost inventory persists.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant disruption due to 'ghost inventory'\u2014lost shipments from periods 17-21, 25, and likely 30, which remain in the 'In-transit' figure (now 800) but will never arrive. Based on historical data, the reliable lead time (L) averages 2 periods but is highly volatile (1-3 periods). Demand remains stable at approximately 100 units per period. With 0 on-hand inventory and the backend's base-stock logic seeing 800 units in transit, it will naturally order 0 units unless mu_hat is manually overridden. To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers the pipeline gap, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1100. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand (approx 300) plus an offset for the approximately 800 units of ghost inventory. This will force the OR engine to maintain product flow despite the inflated in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Ghost inventory remains the primary driver of systemic under-ordering. In-transit (800) is heavily inflated by lost orders (P17-21, P25, P30, and potentially P31-32 which totaled ~250 units but the current in-transit suggests additional accumulation). Explicit mu_hat methodology must be scaled to match the total 'In-transit' value to force order generation.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently compromised by approximately 850 units of 'ghost inventory' - orders that were placed (starting noticeably between P17-P25 and continuing through the recent P30-P38 cycles) but have not arrived and are well beyond the typical maximum lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure is 1100, while the actual reliable pipeline is essentially just the P37 order (250) and P38 order (300) totaling 550 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1100 from its target inventory calculation, resulting in zero or near-zero orders despite a stockout. To force replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a target that exceeds the 'In-transit' value by the desired order volume. Demand is stable (mean ~100). To trigger an order of approximately 300 units, I set mu_hat to 1400 (Target 1400 - Pipeline 1100 = 300 Order). I am keeping L at 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the mean of observed arrivals (Avg 2.0).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost inventory has scaled significantly. In-transit (1100) is now approximately 77% 'ghost' stock (lost orders). Reliable pipeline consists only of P37 (250) and P38 (300). Explicit mu_hat must be scaled to 'In-transit + Desired Order' to bypass systemic backend under-ordering.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, 300 units arrived from the Period 38 order (L=1), leaving on-hand inventory at 216. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1100 units. Based on historical data, specifically the carry-over insights from Period 39, we've identified that approximately 850 units in this pipeline are 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P17-P21, P25, P30-32, etc.) that will never arrive. The only reliable pipeline order is from Period 39 (300 units). The OR backend calculates orders as [Base Stock - On Hand - In Transit]. With 'In-transit' at 1100, the backend will refuse to order anything unless mu_hat is set to a level that exceeds (On-Hand + In-Transit). To maintain a steady supply of ~300 units per period (tripling the mean demand of ~100 to account for volatility and recovery), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1700 (Current On-Hand 216 + In-Transit 1100 + Desired Order 384). This 'explicit' mu_hat bypasses the backend's deflationary inventory logic. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed ghost inventory has reached approximately 850 units (calculated as In-transit 1100 minus reliable P39 order 300 and adjusting for recent arrivals). This 'ghost' stock continues to block automated ordering, necessitating mu_hat values scaled to [Total Pipeline + Buffer] to force order generation.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows On-hand: 421 and In-transit: 1184. Over the past 40 periods, we have confirmed a recurring pattern of 'ghost inventory' where lost orders (specifically from batches P17-P21, P25, P30, and likely bits of P31-35) remain in the pipeline but never arrive. As of Period 40, we estimated ghost inventory at approximately 850 units. The current In-transit (1184) reflects the 384 units ordered in Period 40 plus approximately 800 units of lost/overdue orders. To ensure the OR backend continues to order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (Pipeline - Ghost Inventory + Desired Buffer). Since the backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and assumes Pipe_Inv is 1184, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1500. This forces the system to calculate a base stock that triggers a replenishment order of roughly 1500 - 1184 = 316 units (plus sigma buffer), covering about 3 periods of demand (mean ~100). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period actual lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at approximately 800 units (In-transit 1184 minus P40 order 384). Systematic mu_hat override is required to bypass blocking from these lost orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-217.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with a significant 'ghost inventory' problem. The system's 'In-transit' count is 1184 units, but a large portion of this consists of lost shipments (primarily from periods 17-21, 25, 30, and 31). Analyzing the recent history: the order from P39 (300 units) arrived in P40 (L=1), and the order from P40 (384 units) is expected to arrive in P41 or P42. However, P41 conclude shows 0 arrived, meaning the P40 order is still in transit (L>=2). The reliable pipeline consists of the P40 order (384 units). The remaining ~800 units in 'In-transit' (1184 - 384 = 800) are likely 'ghost' units that will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce orders; if pipeline + on-hand > base_stock, it orders 0. With On-hand=319 and In-transit=1184, the backend sees 1503 units, far exceeding any reasonable base stock for a product with mean demand ~100. To force order flow, I must set mu_hat (which determines base_stock) to a value that exceeds this inflated inventory. I will aim for a target base stock of approximately 1850 to ensure an order of ~350 units is placed (1850 - 1503 = 347). This maintains the buffer against continued lead-time volatility and the systemic inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Ghost inventory remains stable at approximately 800 units. Reliable pipeline currently only includes the Period 40 order (384 units). Explicit mu_hat must remain highly elevated (1800+) to bypass the 1184 'In-transit' units and maintain product flow.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy due to 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) inflating the 'In-transit' field. As of the start of Period 43, In-transit is 1531 units. Based on historical data, the reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (384 units) and Period 42 (347 units), totaling 731 units. This means approximately 800 units in the pipeline are lost/ghost stock. To force the OR backend's order calculation to generate an order despite this ghost inventory, I must set the mu_hat to a value that covers the total observed In-transit (1531) plus the desired safety stock and next-period demand (approx 300 units). Demand remains stable around a mean of 100 units/period. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1900 ensures that the backend (which subtracts the 1531 in-transit from the base stock) still places an order of roughly 350-400 units, maintaining product flow as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains stable at approximately 800 units. Reliable pipeline consists of P40 (384) and P42 (347). In-transit (1531) is ~52% lost stock. mu_hat must be scaled to ~1900 to ensure replenishment orders are not blocked.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we start with 492 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' reported is 1272. However, historical evidence confirms a substantial amount of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) inflating this figure. Specifically, orders from P17-P21 (139 units), P25 (41 units), P30 (151 units), P31 (100 units - actually arrived but let's re-verify), and potentially others totaling ~800 units have not and likely will not arrive. The reliable pipeline currently consists of Period 42 (347 units) and Period 43 (125 units), totaling 472 units. Arrival resolution from Period 43 shows the Period 40 order (384 units) arrived after 3 periods. Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units. To maintain stock flow and prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the 1272 units of ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'In-transit' plus the desired safety stock. Desired stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) is ~300 units plus buffer. To force an order of approximately 200-300 units when the system thinks we have 1764 units (On-hand 492 + In-transit 1272), I set mu_hat explicitly to 2100. This ensures the calculation 'base_stock - pipeline' results in a positive order volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost inventory is confirmed at approximately 800 units (1272 total in-transit minus 472 units from P42-P43). This continues to block the OR backend's default logic, requiring explicit mu_hat overrides to ensure replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-368.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing a significant issue with 'ghost inventory' - lost shipments that remain in the 'In-transit' count, misleading the OR backend into under-ordering. The current In-transit balance is 1608 units. Based on historical analysis, approximately 800 units of this are confirmed lost (ghost stock from P17-P21, P25, P30, etc.). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P42 (347), P43 (125), and P44 (336), totaling 808 units. As observed in P43, the P40 order (384 units) did arrive with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that orders can still arrive, but the 'In-transit' figure is roughly double the actual expected arrivals. To ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'In-transit' amount plus the desired buffer. I am targeting an ordering volume that maintains a 3-4 period safety stock. Given the current on-hand of 430 and a demand mean of ~100, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2000 to force the backend to clear the 1608 units of pipeline and still order approximately 350-400 units, sustaining the inventory flow for the final stages of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-688.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 795 units following the arrival of 472 units (from P42 and P43). The 'In-transit' figure of 1136 is heavily inflated by approximately 800 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P17-P21, P25, P30, P31, and likely others) which will never arrive but still subtract from the OR backend's order calculation. To maintain stock as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), we must ensure enough real product is in the pipeline. Currently, the only reliable in-transit order is from P44 (336 units). At a mean demand of ~100/period, our current on-hand (795) plus reliable pipeline (336) equals 1131 units, which covers roughly 11 periods of demand\u2014more than enough for the remaining 5 periods. Therefore, no new orders are needed. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to a low value to allow on-hand inventory to deplete naturally, avoiding further holding costs while maintaining a service level buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-699.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory is 747 units, which is sufficient for approximately 7.5 periods of demand (avg ~100/period). The 'In-transit' figure of 1136 continues to be heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' from previous lost shipments (estimated >800 units based on historical tracking). Recent arrivals in Period 45 (total 472 units from P42 and P43) successfully replenished the stock. Since we are at Period 47 of 50, and current on-hand inventory (747) comfortably exceeds the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (approx. 300-350 units), there is no need to place further orders. Ordering now would only incur unnecessary holding costs. I will set mu_hat to a low value to ensure the OR backend's capped policy results in a zero order, while maintaining default L and sigma_hat as they are no longer the primary decision drivers for the final phase of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Stock levels (747) now exceed remaining game demand (approx 300 units for P48-P50). Shift strategy to harvesting; no further orders required. Ghost inventory persists in system data but is effectively bypassed by current stock position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-509.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the harvest phase (Period 48 of 50). Current on-hand inventory is 628 units. Historical demand mean is approximately 100 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is approximately 300 units. Since 628 units >> 300 remaining units, we have a significant surplus. To maximize reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), we must prevent any further ordering to minimize terminal holding costs. The in-transit pipeline (1136 units) contains a mix of 'ghost stock' (~800 units) and recent real orders (P44); however, even if the real orders arrive, they will only further increase the holding cost. We set L to explicit 0, mu_hat to explicit 0, and sigma_hat to explicit 0 to ensure the OR backend calculated base stock is 0, effectively shutting down new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Final harvest phase confirmed. On-hand inventory (628) covers 2x remaining game demand (~300 units). No further ordering is required to minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-464.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The game concludes after Period 50's demand resolution. Currently, on-hand inventory is 546 units. Historical demand mean is approximately 100 units per period. With only two demand periods remaining (Period 49 and Period 50), total expected demand is roughly 200 units. Since 546 units >> 200 units, we are in a 'harvest' phase where we should not place any further orders to avoid excessive holding costs. Ghost inventory (approx 800+ units) still exists in the 'In-transit' field but no longer impacts our decision as our on-hand stock is sufficient to cover the rest of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-272.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final decision point (Period 50). The primary goal is to maximize total reward by harvesting the remaining inventory while minimizing holding costs, as any units left at the end of Period 50 contribute to holding costs without further sales opportunities. On-hand inventory is currently 409 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the final period (historic average demand ~100 units). Therefore, no additional orders are required. The 'In-transit' figure of 1136 units contains a mix of real late-game orders (like Period 44) and the substantial 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) identified throughout the game; regardless, current on-hand stock is the only relevant factor for the final period's demand. Parameters are set to default to ensure zero additional orders are generated by the backend.
