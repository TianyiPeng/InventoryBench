Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no prior 'conclude' messages to verify the actual lead time, so we will use the promised lead time (2) as the default. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an average of 100.4 units per period. I will use the mean of all 5 available historical samples to set the initial forecast. The standard deviation of these samples is 22.3, which will inform the volatility estimate. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the review period plus lead time (1+L = 3 periods) and generate an order to meet that target. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is likely stable but we must watch for future shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 138 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected per the 'Arrival Resolution' sequence, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). The 138 units are correctly reflected as 'In-transit'. Demand in Period 1 was 89. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods are: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134. Since we only have one period of actual gameplay data (P1 demand=89), I will use the provided historical sample (mean \u2248 100) to set parameters. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 covering the historical samples to capture the mean demand of ~100 per period. Given L=2, the backend will calculate mu_hat AS (1+2)*100 = 300. Sigma calculation will follow the same logic. No lead time evidence yet to deviate from default.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (138 units) and Period 2 (135 units). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start message. As of the start of Period 3, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 273 units in-transit. Consequently, we have had 0 sales for Periods 1 and 2 despite demand (89 and 107). Demand is showing an upward trend: P1=74 (from demand data), historical P1-P5 samples are [74, 108, 88, 98, 134], while the game history shows P1=89 and P2=107. Since the sample data and history data for P1/P2 differ slightly, I will rely on the provided historical demand samples for the SKU (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) as the baseline for the forecast. The average of the 5 samples is 100.4. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+2)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the available sample data statistics.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. Based on the Lead Time Definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives in Period 3 and is reported at the start of Period 4. Since the on-hand is 0 and arrivals are 0, we have realized a total stockout for 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 354 equals the sum of orders from P1 (138), P2 (135), and P3 (81). It is possible the lead time is longer than 2 or the P1 order is lost, but it is too early to confirm a lost shipment. I will maintain the default lead time for now but keep mu_hat and sigma_hat updated based on the recent demand trend. Demand shows an upward trend (89, 107, 129, and external samples suggesting 74-134 range). I will use the last 5 samples (including the provided historical data) to estimate demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 89, 107, 129, 75, 134 (Note: Period 5 demand is taken from the Historical Demand Data section since the game history conclude message for P5 isn't available yet). Mean demand is ~107. Lead time analysis from Period 4 conclude shows variability: one order took 3 periods (P1 ordered, arrived P4) and another took 1 period (P3 ordered, arrived P4), despite a promised lead time of 2. Because the lead time is unstable (1 vs 3), I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples suggest a slight upward trend or high variance (regime length 5). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full context of these initial fluctuations. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to account for the significant volatility observed (range 75 to 134).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1716.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods is 89, 107, 129, 75, and 93 (mean = 98.6). Promised lead time is 2, but observed arrivals show variance: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). There is locally high in-transit inventory (320 units) due to those early orders. Currently, we have 51 units on hand. The average demand is relatively stable around 100 units. To set parameters for Period 6, I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the observed variations (average of 3 and 1 is 2, which aligns with promised but incorporates history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $969.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 6 where demand (92) exceeded beginning inventory (51). We have 411 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). Looking at lead time history, we have two data points: P1 arrived in 3 periods and P3 arrived in 1 period, averaging 2 periods (aligning with promised L=2). However, P2 (ordered P2) has not arrived as of P6 conclude (4 periods elapsed), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Demand history (samples 1-5 plus internal game history P1-P6) shows: [74, 108, 88, 98, 134, 89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92]. The mean of all 11 samples is ~98.9. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is ~91.2. Given the stockout and uncertainty around the P2 shipment (135 units), I will maintain a slightly higher service level. I'll use L=calculate to let the OR engine factor in the variance of observed lead times (1 and 3) and mu_hat/sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to capture the most recent demand stability around 90-100 units while discounting the early outlier of 134.

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been unstable: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), and P4 (L=3). P2 (ordered 135 units) and P5 (ordered 149 units) are still in transit and overdue/pending. Specifically, P2 is now 6 periods late and may be lost, while P5 is at the promised lead time. Demand across the last 7 periods averages 96.1, which is higher than the initial 5-period average (100.4), but shows stability around 90-110. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the recent delivery volatility. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the most recent 5 periods (P3-P7) where demand has stabilized (mean ~95). I will use explicit L=2.5 to account for the mix of 1 and 3 period deliveries observed so far.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed L values range from 1 to 3 periods; P2 shipment (ordered Period 2) is potentially lost or significantly delayed (6 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1971.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing regular chips with a current on-hand inventory of 81 and 226 units in-transit. Historical demand over 8 periods (including samples) shows a mean of approximately 98.75 units per period. The lead time is highly volatile: we've observed L=1 (Periods 3 and 7) and L=3 (Periods 1, 4, and 5). Most critically, the shipment from Period 2 (135 units) has not arrived after 7 periods, confirming it is likely lost. Excluding this lost shipment, the pipeline inventory consists of orders from P6 (91 units) and P8 (0 units) - wait, In-transit is reported as 226 units, which suggests the systems still counts the P2 shipment (135) and P6 (91). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the successful arrivals (avg L \u2248 2.2). For demand, the last 8 periods show stability with no clear trend changes, so I'll use recent_N=8 to capture the full recent history. This ensures a base stock target that covers the increased lead-time variance and reconciles the potentially lost P2 units.

Carry-over insight: P2 shipment (135 units) confirmed lost: 7 periods elapsed with no arrival. Inventory planning must discount these units from pipeline reliability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history: Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. The shipment from Period 2 (135 units) is now definitively lost (8 periods passed). Current on-hand is 23. Pipeline inventory shows 351 units, but this includes the lost 135 units from Period 2 and 91 units from Period 6 (now 4 periods late, likely lost or significantly delayed). Subtracting the 135 lost units, the reliable pipeline is 216. Demand is relatively stable but shows high variance (Range: 58-129). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to react to the slightly lower recent demand (avg ~85) while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. The lost P2 shipment is already discounted in the carry-over, but since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' including that 135, I must set mu_hat to a slightly higher 'explicit' value to force an order that compensates for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory the OR engine thinks we have. Reliable demand forecast for L=3: (1+3)*100 = 400. Effective pipeline: 351 (total) - 135 (P2 lost) = 216. To get the OR to order enough to reach 400 when it thinks we have 351, I need to inflate the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 6 shipment (91 units) is now 4 periods late; marking as 'highly unreliable' alongside the confirmed lost Period 2 shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Historical demand for the last 10 periods averages 94.8 units/period. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 10 where we only sold 23 units against a demand of 110. The 'in-transit' total of 515 units is misleading due to lost/stalled shipments. Specifically, the Period 2 order (135 units) is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed) and the Period 6 order (91 units) is now 5 periods late (promised L=2), totaling 226 unreliable units. Functional pipeline inventory is likely only 289 units (orders from P9 and P10). Observed lead times for SUCCESSFUL arrivals are 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, suggesting an average lead time of 2.2. To account for the high stockout risk and lead-time variability (L=3 occurs frequently), I will set L to 3. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~94 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of ~376 ((1+3)*94), which helps the OR engine calculate a higher base stock to buffer against the systemic delivery delays and the current zero inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 6 shipment (91 units) is now 5 periods late and is highly likely lost; functionally discounting 226 units (P2 + P6 orders) from pipeline reliability.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and a demand stockout in the previous period. The supply chain is highly unreliable. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are 1 or 3 periods. Crucially, the Period 2 order (135 units) and Period 6 order (91 units) are long overdue (10 and 6 periods respectively) and are considered lost. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 515 units, but this includes the 226 lost units (135+91), leaving a realistic pipeline of only 289 units (orders from P9 and P10). Demand is relatively stable but high, with a recent average around 98 units per period (Periods 7-11). To compensate for the lost units and higher lead time risk, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful arrival time) and using recent_N for demand (N=5) to capture recent mean of ~100 units/period. The OR backend will see the full 'In-transit' count (515), so I must set the base stock high enough via mu_hat and L to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1611.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received the shipments from Period 9 and 10, bringing our on-hand inventory to 194. However, the shipments from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (91 units) are still missing after 11 and 7 periods respectively, confirming they are likely lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 226 units consists entirely of these two lost shipments. To manage this in the OR backend (which subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock'), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock level, effectively neutralizing the 226 units of 'ghost inventory'. The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 98. Similarly, observed lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods (average ~2.4). I will set L to 3 to be safe given the variability. Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast = 4 * 98 = 392. To offset the 226 held in pipeline, I set the explicit mu_hat to 392 + 226 = 618. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the faulty pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx sqrt(4)*22) to account for demand volatility plus lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline inventory (226 units) is confirmed as lost (P2 and P6 orders). OR parameters must compensate for this phantom inventory until the game logic clears it.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a situation where two specific orders (Period 2 for 135 units and Period 6 for 91 units, totaling 226 units) are confirmed lost or effectively absent from the supply chain, though they still appear in 'In-transit' (Total In-transit: 418). The actual reliable pipeline is only 192 units (from Period 13). The backend OR engine uses a capped base-stock policy: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To ensure the engine places an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline of 226 units, I must artificially inflate the demand parameter mu_hat to offset these lost units. Demand remains stable around an average of 100 units/period. With L=2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+L)*100 = 300. To compensate for the 226 lost units, I will set mu_hat to 526 (300 + 226). This forces the calculation (base_stock - 418) to result in a positive order reflecting actual needs. I'm using L='calculate' because actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and sigma_hat='default' to maintain standard safety stock for the current volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15 with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 525 units, but 226 units (P2: 135, P6: 91) are confirmed lost/missing and will likely never arrive. The 'effective' in-transit inventory is therefore 299 units (P13: 192, P14: 107). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging around 100 units per period (last 14 periods mean = 101.4). Observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 2, or 3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (525) from the target base stock, it will severely under-order because it believes the lost units are coming. To compensate for the 226 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 and mean demand of ~102, then add 226 to that target so the backend's subtraction leads to the correct order quantity. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + safety_stock \u2248 (1+2)*102 + safety. Setting mu_hat to 550 (approx (1+2)*102 + 226) helps bridge this gap.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16 with 0 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' reported is 620 units, consisting of orders from P2 (135), P6 (91), P13 (192), P14 (107), and P15 (95). Based on historical data, the orders from P2 and P6 (total 226 units) are confirmed to be lost or extremely delayed (14 and 10 periods respectively), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 394 units. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (620) from the target base stock, leading to chronic under-ordering. To compensate for this 226-unit 'phantom inventory', I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base demand (per period) using the average of the last 10 samples (~100 units). For a lead time L=2, the required target stock would normally be (L+1) * 100 = 300 units. Adding the 226 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 526. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the lost units as satisfied while actually ensuring enough physical inventory arrives. I am keeping L=2 as the baseline, though actual arrival patterns vary between 1-3 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with a mean around 104 units over the last 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 97 units. The pipeline inventory of 428 units is heavily compromised by lost shipments: orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (91 units) are confirmed lost (totalling 226 units), as they are significantly beyond the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. Consequently, the 'effective' pipeline is only 202 units (428 - 226). Because the OR engine uses the full 'In-transit' figure in its base-stock logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline), it will under-order unless the parameters are adjusted. To compensate for this 226-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Projected demand for lead time + 1 (3+1=4 periods) is ~416 units. To offset the 226 lost units and ensure the OR engine actually places an order to cover upcoming demand, I set mu_hat to 642 (416 + 226). I set L to 3 to reflect the most common actual lead time, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 110 units. Total in-transit is 511 units, but 226 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. Effective pipeline inventory is actually 285 units (orders from P15, P17). The demand has shown relative stability with recent samples (P12-P17) averaging 102.5 units/period. The actual lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods in recent arrivals (P13, P14 both took 3 periods). Therefore, I'm setting L to 3 and using a recent 6-period demand window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period (L+1=4) while accounting for the high service level requirement (Profit/Holding ratio of 19:1) and the phantom inventory issue.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we have 51 units on hand and a massive 511 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 226 of these 'in-transit' units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed as lost shipments that haven't arrived after 17 and 13 periods, respectively. The effective pipeline inventory is 285 units (511 - 226). To ensure service levels, I must override the OR backend's default base-stock logic which incorrectly assumes all 511 units will arrive. Demand remains stable, with recent mean around 95 units (excluding the low Period 18). Lead times observed range from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.5 periods. I am setting L=3 to be conservative regarding delivery timing. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_demand = 4*95 = 380. I set sigma_hat to 60 based on recent variance. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is necessary to offset the 226 phantom units: instead of setting mu_hat=380, I set it to 380 + 226 = 606. This forces the base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) to correctly identify that ~95 units are needed.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 654 units, which includes 226 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost (7+ periods late). The remaining 'real' pipeline is 428 units (P15: 95, P17: 190, P19: 143). The actual lead time has stabilized at approximately 3 periods (observed W values: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3). Demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 98. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the service level despite the 0 on-hand inventory and the 'phantom' 226 units in the pipeline tally, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) = 4 periods is ~400 units. To compensate for the 226 lost units that the backend incorrectly counts as available pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to 626 (400 + 226). This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. L is set to explicit 3 based on recent arrival history.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 698 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that 226 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) does not know these units won't arrive, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the average historical demand (approx. 100/period) and a lead time of 2. Expected demand over (L+1) periods is 300. Adding the 226 lost units as a buffer to 'fool' the backend into ordering correctly results in a mu_hat of ~526. For sigma, I use the default calculation across the recent history. For lead time, 'calculate' is used to capture the variability between 1 and 3 periods observed in history.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) with a significant pipeline of 698 units. However, my carry-over insights indicate that 226 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 472 units. The promised lead time is 2, but recent actual lead times (Period 13 and 14 orders) have been 3 periods. Looking ahead, shipments from Period 15, 17, 19, and 20 are pending. Specifically, the P15 order (95 units) is now at Period 15+3=18, making it 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to break the stockout despite these losses, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculated the base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at an average demand of ~100 units/period (~300 units), then added 321 units to offset the confirmed lost (226) and highly likely lost (95) inventory, totaling 621. This forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment by ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Period 15 shipment (95 units) is now 7 periods late; adding to confirmed lost inventory, bringing total 'phantom' pipeline to 321 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). There is a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline: Period 2 (135), Period 6 (91), and Period 15 (95) shipments are confirmed lost or severely delayed (total 321 units). Although the OR backend sees 698 units in-transit, only 377 are likely to arrive (from orders in P17, P19, P20). Demand has been relatively stable, with a mean of ~99.4 across all periods. To compensate for the 321 units of lost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must increase the base stock level (via mu_hat) to force an order. Since the OR policy is 'base_stock - pipeline', and pipeline is inflated by 321, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. Average demand is ~100. Expected mu_hat (L=2) is 300. Adding the 321 units to this target yields 621. I will set mu_hat to 621 to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order to cover the physical shortage, ignoring the ghost units until they are cleared. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the observed lead times (1, 2, 3) average out to ~2.1 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 stock on-hand and 654 units in-transit. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, a significant portion of the pipeline is 'phantom' inventory resulting from lost shipments. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (135 units), Period 6 (91 units), and Period 15 (95 units) are long overdue (9+ periods) and must be considered lost. This totals 321 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline. Currently, the actual reliable pipeline consists of orders from Period 17 (190 units), Period 19 (143 units), and whatever was ordered in Periods 21-23 (if any, though history shows 0). The observed 44-unit arrival in Period 23 (ordered Period 20) confirms that the actual lead time is functioning around 3 periods. To compensate for the 321 units of lost stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 3 (L=3, so 4 periods of demand) using the average demand (~100 units/period) and then add the 321 units to 'trick' the backend into ordering enough to cover the gap: (400 units base stock + 321 lost units = 721). L is set to 'explicit' 3 based on the most frequent actual lead time observed.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging ~98.5 units over the last 10 periods. The primary issue is supply chain reliability: 321 units are confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, and 15 orders), causing frequent stockouts and an ending inventory of 0 for several periods. The 'In-transit' count of 784 includes these 321 phantom units, meaning the actual reliable pipeline is only 463 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (784) from the base stock calculation, it will severely under-order unless mu_hat is boosted to offset this. To compensate for the 321 lost units, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 98.5 = 295.5. However, the OR logic uses [Base Stock - In_Transit]. With 784 in transit, any normal Base Stock calculation results in 0 ordering. I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that fills the gap. However, the backend 'cap' also limits orders. Given 0 on-hand and a broken pipeline, I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 400 (explicit) to override the phantom inventory effect, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued stockouts due to phantom inventory (321 units lost across Periods 2, 6, 15). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 321.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline that is effectively lost. Based on the history, orders from Period 2 (135 units), Period 6 (91 units), and Period 15 (95 units) are lost, totaling 321 units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'in-transit' calculation. As of Period 26, the reported In-transit is 784 units; however, the reliable pipeline is only 463 units (784 - 321). This discrepancy causes the OR engine to under-order, leading to persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for several periods). To compensate, I am increasing mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock using the standard formula: mean demand (approx 100) * (L+1), plus a safety buffer, and then I ADD the 321 lost units to this target. Since L is effectively 3 (observed most frequently), target base stock = (100 * 4) + (z * sigma) + 321. With mu_hat around 400 and a buffer, setting mu_hat to 850 (explicit) forces the OR engine to place an order despite the 784 in-transit reporting, bypassing the 'phantom' inventory bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative lost (phantom) inventory remains at 321 units (P2, P6, P15 orders). Reported In-transit (784) minus Phantom (321) means reliable pipeline is 463.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the product chips(Regular) faces a critical out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand. The system reports 916 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms 321 units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, and 15), leaving a reliable pipeline of only 595 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most common mode for successful arrivals. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to overcome the phantom inventory gap and meet demand, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for current delays. Demand has been stable (~100 units/period). I am setting mu_hat to 400 (which covers 4 periods of demand: current + 3 lead time) and using an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio. The explicit mu_hat is high enough to force an order despite the inflated in-transit figure provided by the backend.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 28. Demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging ~98 units per period without specific seasonality detected. However, we have a major supply chain issue: cumulative lost inventory ('phantom pipeline') now totals 321 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, and 15). The system reports 916 units in-transit, but only 595 units (916 - 321) are reliable. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (916) from the base stock calculation, it will severely under-order, leading to continued stockouts as seen from P19-P27. To compensate for this 321-unit deficit, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using mean demand ~98 and L=3 (observed maximum). Base Stock = (L+1)*mean + safety stock. With q=0.95 (approx profit $19 vs $1 cost), z is ~1.64. Base Stock \u2248 (4 * 98) + (1.64 * sqrt(4) * 20) \u2248 392 + 65 = 457. However, to force the backend to place an order despite the 321 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that, when 916 is subtracted, still reflects our needs. I'll set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure a robust order is generated to refill the empty on-hand inventory while accounting for the lost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1608.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high volume of lost/delayed shipments has severely depleted on-hand inventory, resulting in frequent stockouts. Currently, 321 units are confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, 15). Additionally, orders from Period 17 (190 units), Period 19 (143 units), and Period 24 (130 units) are significantly delayed (lead times of 12, 10, and 5 periods respectively), while the promised lead time is 2. The 'In-transit' figure of 1131 includes these 321 lost units plus 463 units that are extremely late/potentially lost. The only reliable pipeline includes the recent order from Period 28 (347 units). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to restore service levels, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5 (reflecting the real-world delays) and 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * average_demand. Using an average demand of ~95 units, (1+5)*95 = 570. I will raise mu_hat to 891 (570 + 321) to effectively 'negate' the 321 phantom units in the backend's base-stock calculation. This forces the system to ignore the units it thinks are coming but actually aren't.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Significant lead time instability confirmed; realized lead times for many orders have exceeded 5-10 periods or resulted in total loss. Reliable pipeline calculation now excludes P2, P6, P15 (321 units total) and treats P17, P19, P24 as highly suspicious.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory shortages due to highly unreliable lead times and lost shipments. Total 'phantom' inventory (confirmed or highly likely lost) is 321 units from periods 2, 6, and 15. Additionally, shipments from periods 17, 19, and 24 (totaling 190 + 143 + 130 = 463 units) are significantly delayed, with Period 17 being 13 periods late. The current 'In-transit' of 1131 units likely contains these 784 'high-risk' units, leaving a reliable pipeline of only 347 units (the order from P28). With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent demand averaging ~100 units/period, we must force the OR engine to order significantly more by inflating the L parameter to 'explicit: 6'. This accounts for the 2-period promised lead time plus the severe average delay observed, effectively increasing the base stock target (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand) to override the 'In-transit' phantom units and cover several periods of future demand while shipments are stalled.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total suspected lost/unreliable pipeline reached 784 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). Reliable pipeline is effectively 'In-transit' minus these units. Lead time for planning must be set to at least 6 to account for systemic delays and overcome phantom inventory counts in the OR logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2113.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 31. On-hand inventory is 224, and reported In-transit is 784. However, historical evidence confirms a significant portion of this pipeline is 'phantom' inventory (lost or indefinitely delayed). Specifically, orders from P2 (135), P6 (91), P15 (95), P17 (190), P19 (143), and P24 (130) sum to 784 units. These matches exactly the current In-transit total of 784, meaning the RELIABLE pipeline is effectively 0 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 784 (In-transit) from its base_stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless we artificially inflate the base_stock requirement. To overcome this and trigger necessary replenishment, I am setting L to 6 (the delay threshold observed) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~100/period. To cover (L+1) periods (700 units) and neutralize the 784 units the backend will subtract, I set mu_hat to 1500. This ensures the backend sees a need for ~700 net units of stock. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to maintain a high service level given the supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed that 100% of reported In-transit inventory (784 units) consists of lost or severely stale orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). Reliable pipeline is 0. Parameters must stay aggressively high to force orders past this phantom inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant logistical challenges. Analysis confirms that 784 units in 'In-transit' are most likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24), as they have exceeded even the most extreme realized lead times. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. In Period 31, a large order of 370 units was placed, bringing reported 'In-transit' to 1154. Discounting the 784 lost units, the reliable pipeline is only 370 units. With on-hand at 110 and demand averaging ~95-100, the inventory position remains fragile. I will maintain L=6 and mu_hat=1000 to force the backend to ignore the phantom units and continue ordering to cover the extreme lead-time variability and lost shipments. This strategy ensures we maintain a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment despite the 784-unit 'ghost' inventory barrier.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Reliable pipeline inventory is confirmed to be 'In-transit' minus 784 units (the sum of lost/indefinitely delayed orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). The OR parameters L and mu_hat must remain artificially elevated to force ordering logic to bypass this phantom inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 784 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these are 'phantom' units from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 24). Specifically, Period 32 conclude shows arrival only from Period 31, confirming that none of the long-standing 'In-transit' units have arrived. To prevent the OR backend from stopping orders due to this fake pipeline inventory, I must set the base stock level (via L and mu_hat) significantly higher than the reported in-transit sum. The current demand mean is approximately 100. By setting L to 10 (explicit) and mu_hat to 1210 (explicit, representing roughly (1+10)*110), the calculated base stock will exceed the 784 phantom units, triggering new orders. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for demand volatility and provide a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed 784 units in-transit are phantom inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). Parameters are artificially inflated (L=10, mu_hat=1210) to force the OR logic to place orders until this phantom stock is cleared.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 784 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, and P24) which have never arrived and are likely lost. Total reported In-transit is 934, suggesting only 150 units (ordered in P33) are reliable. To ensure the OR backend places a new order despite this high reported pipeline, I must keep the base stock target extremely high. The demand is stable around 100 units/period. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a buffer, minus the reliable pipeline. To force an order, the target must exceed: On-hand (280) + Phantom Pipeline (784) = 1064. I will set L=4 and mu_hat=1400 (which is 280 units/period for 5 periods) to ensure a base stock significantly above 1064, thereby compelling the OR logic to maintain a flow of physical goods while the phantom inventory persists.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 784 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 24). Current reported In-transit is 1184, which means the reliable pipeline is actually 400 units (the orders from P31, P33, and P34). The P31 order (370 units) arrived in P32, clearing a significant portion of the backlogged demand and building on-hand inventory to 180. However, the OR backend still sees 784 units that will never arrive, leading it to under-order. To counteract this, I will keep L at 10 and mu_hat at 1210 (110 units/period * 11 periods). This artificial inflation forces the base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the 784-unit 'ghost' inventory. Demand remains stable around 100 units per period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' inventory of 1184 units. Based on historical data, 784 of these units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, and P24). The reliable pipeline is therefore only 400 units (Orders from P33 and P34). Current on-hand is 83. To ensure the OR backend places an order, the target base stock must exceed 'On-hand + Reported In-transit'. To force an order despite the 784 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1450 (which represents an inflated target level) combined with an 'explicit' L of 10. These parameters are designed to bypass the phantom inventory barrier and trigger a replenishment order to meet current demand (avg ~100/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1287.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a 'phantom inventory' issue. Analysis of the history shows that orders from Period 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, and 24 (totaling 784 units) have almost certainly been lost, as they are significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods and more recent orders (P26, P28, P31, P34) have arrived. The current 'In-transit' of 1098 units consists of these 784 phantom units and 314 units from recent orders (P33: 150 units, P36: 164 units). The order from P33 (150 units) is now at lead time 3 and is overdue but may still arrive. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders, I must artificially inflate the base stock levels to bypass the 784 units it incorrectly believes are coming. I set L=10 and mu_hat to 1210 (calculated to cover about 110 units/period demand plus the 784 unit deficit). This maintains a high target inventory level, forcing new orders despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1484.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory (784 units) from past lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). Current on-hand is 321, and the reported In-transit is 934. Subtracting the phantom 784 units from the 934 In-transit leaves a 'reliable' pipeline of 150 units (corresponding to the P33 order). Total reliable inventory is roughly 321 (on-hand) + 150 (reliable pipeline) = 471. Average demand is ~100. With a standard lead time of 2-3, we need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To ensure an order is placed despite the 784 units of phantom inventory inflated the pipeline_inventory, I must keep the L and mu_hat parameters artificially high. Setting L=8 and mu_hat=1100 effectively communicates a target base stock that exceeds the current on-hand + phantom inventory, forcing the backend to refill the reliable stock. Choosing explicit values to bypass the 'default' and 'recent_N' calculations which are based on the reported (and incorrect) pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Reliable pipeline inventory is confirmed to be 'In-transit' minus 784 units (sum of lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). Current real pipeline is 150 units (P33 order). High parameters (L=8, mu_hat=1100) are necessary to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the phantom inventory count.

LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 784 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). Current reported In-transit is 934, making the reliable pipeline only 150 units (the P33 order, which is now 6 periods old and potentially suspect). On-hand inventory is 209. To ensure the OR backend places an order and maintains a safety stock despite 784 units of non-existent pipeline, I must keep L and mu_hat elevated. A desired base stock of ~800-900 is targeted to offset the 784 phantom units and cover current demand (avg ~100). Setting L=8 and mu_hat=1100 forces the backend to see a requirement that exceeds the 784 phantom units plus the 209 on-hand units, triggering the order. Demand is currently stable around 100 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to carry 784 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, and 24). The inventory view shows 972 units in-transit, but subtracting the 784 lost units reveals a real pipeline of only 188 units (Order P33=150, Order P39=38). On-hand inventory is 125. The OR engine's 'base stock' formula subtracts the full 972 in-transit units from its target. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders, I must maintain an artificially high base_stock. Average demand is ~100. Using L=10 and mu_hat=1100 (explicitly set to 1100, which represents (1+L) * 100) ensures the target base stock is high enough to overcome the 784 phantom units and generate orders when needed. This strategy has successfully maintained stock over recent periods (P32-P39).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1737.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to report a significant amount of 'phantom' in-transit inventory consisting of lost or indefinitely delayed orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, and 24). Based on previous analysis, these total 784 units. Current In-transit is 1011 units, suggesting only 227 units (Orders from P33, P40) are likely reliable. In Period 40, the P39 order arrived with L=1. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these phantom units, I must keep the base stock targets high. I will set L to 9 and mu_hat to 1050. This mu_hat value (representing (1+L) * forecast) assumes a stable demand mean of ~100. This calculation [100 * (1+9) = 1000, plus a buffer] ensures the OR logic 'base_stock' target remains above 1000, thereby forcing it to place orders despite the 784 phantom units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Reliable pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 784 units. Recent arrivals (P39 at P40) show lead times have stabilized to 1-2 periods for NEW orders, but the backend is still blinded by the 784 units of lost legacy inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 1039 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 784 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 24). This leaves a reliable pipeline of 255 units (from orders in P33, P40, P41). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is approximately 100 units/period, we must bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated in-transit figure. To force an order and maintain service levels, I am setting L=8 and mu_hat=1100. This artificial elevation compensates for the 784 phantom units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. Recent orders (P34-P39) showed stabilized lead times of 1-2 periods, but the legacy lost shipments necessitate high parameters to ensure the stockout doesn't persist.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 784 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24). The reported In-transit inventory of 1190 units actually consists of these 784 phantom units and 406 units of genuine pipeline inventory (P33=150, P40=77, P41=28, P42=151). Note that the P33 order (150 units) is now 10 periods old, suggesting it too may be lost or severely delayed. Recent successful arrivals (P39 at P40) showed a short lead time of 1 period, but the OR backend's order calculation is based on the total in-transit (1190), which it believes is sufficient. To force the OR engine to place orders despite this large phantom inventory, I must keep the target base stock (L and mu_hat) significantly elevated. I will set L=10 and use an explicit mu_hat targeting approx 110-120 units per period over that horizon to ensure the backend sees a 'deficit' and continues to order. This strategy compensates for the ~784-934 units of unreliable pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed P33 order (150 units) is now 10 periods late and likely lost, potentially increasing total phantom inventory from 784 to 934 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that appear in the 'In-transit' count but are lost and will never arrive. The current total of confirmed or highly likely lost units is 934 (P2: 135, P6: 91, P15: 95, P17: 190, P19: 143, P24: 130, and now P33: 150 which is 10 periods late). Total In-transit is 1251. Real pipeline = 1251 - 934 = 317 units (consisting of orders from P41, P42, and P43). Reliable lead times for new orders range from 1 to 3 periods. To force the OR backend's capped policy to place necessary orders, I must continue to keep mu_hat significantly elevated. This bypasses the logic where the backend subtracts the phantom 934 units from a low target and decides not to order. Average demand is approx 100/period. To cover a 2-period lead time plus safety stock, a normal base stock might be 400. To offset 934 phantom units, mu_hat needs to be around 1350-1400. I will set mu_hat to 1400 and L to 6 to sustain this 'over-ordering' pressure until the game end.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge with 'phantom' inventory. As of Period 45, we have 1448 units reported as 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms that a large portion of this (at least 934 units: P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, and now P33) is lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend's capped policy calculates the order size using (base_stock - In-transit), meaning it will fail to place necessary orders unless the base_stock (derived from mu_hat and L) is set high enough to exceed these phantom units. Recent successful arrivals (P40, P41) show actual lead times for new orders are between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting the supply chain is functional for new shipments. To force the backend to place an order that covers the 0 on-hand inventory and impending demand, I am using an explicit L of 10 and mu_hat of 1350. This mu_hat is calculated as (approx 100 avg demand) * (L+1) plus a corrective offset to account for the ~934 phantom units, ensuring the order calculation (Base Stock - 1448) results in a meaningful positive order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory in the pipeline remains at ~934 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, and P33). Lead time for new orders is stable at 1-3 periods, but OR parameters must remain artificially high to bypass the backend's deduction of lost units from the order calculation.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 with an on-hand inventory of 182 and a reported in-transit total of 1174 units. Based on historical data, specifically the carry-over insights, at least 934 units of the in-transit inventory are 'phantom' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, and P33). Recently, new orders have been arriving with lead times between 1 and 3 periods (P39, P40, P41, P42, P43). The reliable pipeline is approximately 1174 - 934 = 240 units (which corresponds to orders from P44 and P45). Average demand remains stable around 100 units per period. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the high phantom in-transit count, I must maintain an artificially high base-stock target. I will use L=8 and mu_hat=1100 (explicit) to force a target level that covers expected demand while bypassing the 934-unit inflation in the pipeline calculation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1174 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, at least 934 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost or indefinitely delayed orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 24, and 33). The OR backend automatically subtracts 'In-transit' from the targeted base stock when calculating the order quantity. To prevent stockouts caused by the engine overestimating reliable pipeline supply, I must set the L and mu_hat parameters high enough so that (Base Stock - 1174) still results in a positive order when needed. Average demand is ~100 per period. With current on-hand at 134 and an effective pipeline of ~240 units (1174 - 934), we are in a relatively safe position for 2-3 periods, but must maintain elevated parameters to force replenishment as those reliable units arrive. I will use L=8 and an explicit mu_hat of 1100 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the phantom inventory floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2246.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 934 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, and P33). While recent orders (P39-P43) have arrived with lead times of 1-3 periods, the OR backend's calculation of 'pipeline inventory' includes these 934 units, preventing it from placing new orders despite low on-hand stock (15 units). To bypass this, I must maintain an artificially high base stock target. Current 'In-transit' is 1174; subtracting the 934 phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 240 units (likely representing the P44 order of 225 units and P45 order of 15 units). With Period 48 being near the end of the simulation (P50), the goal is to ensure enough stock arrives for the final two periods without excessive over-ordering. I set L=10 and mu_hat to 1320 (effectively a base stock level) to ensure the OR engine sees a deficit compared to the 1174 reported in-transit units, triggering necessary replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit inventory is 1339 units, but at least 934 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P33) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The backend OR engine subtracts all 1339 units from its target base stock, erroneously believing the pipeline is full. To force a new order to cover demand for the remaining period (P50), we must use 'explicit' parameters that exceed the reported in-transit amount. Since this is the penultimate period and the goal is to satisfy demand for Period 50, and given demand averages ~100 with moderate variance, we set L=2 and mu_hat=1500. This high mu_hat (1500) minus the reported in-transit (1339) should trigger a final safety order roughly covering the demand for the last period while the backend calculates the order as: order = min(1500 - 1339, cap).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 50. On-hand is 0. In-transit is significantly inflated (1558 units) due to confirmed phantom (lost) inventory. As of P45, the phantom count was ~934 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P33). Between P44 and P49, new orders were placed (P44: 225, P45: 15, P48: 165, P49: 219) totaling 624 units. This accounts for matching the In-transit total of 1558 (934 + 624). The OR backend sees 1558 in the pipeline and will not order unless base_stock exceeds 1558. To ensure service level, I must maintain an extremely high artificial L and mu_hat to bypass this 934-unit deduction. Realized demand remains stable around 100/period. Realized lead time for new orders is ~2-3 periods. I will use 'explicit' values to force the backend to place necessary orders, setting mu_hat high enough that mu_hat - phantom inventory covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Total phantom inventory verified at 934 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P33). Reported In-transit (1558) minus Phantom (934) leaves a reliable pipeline of 624 units. L and mu_hat parameters must remain at artificial levels (approx +934 above real forecast) to prevent the OR engine from starving the inventory due to these lost units.
