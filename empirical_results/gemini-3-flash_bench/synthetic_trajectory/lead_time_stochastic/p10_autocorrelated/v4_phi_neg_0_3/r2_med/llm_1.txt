In a vending context, demand is generally steady but influenced by local traffic. b) Demand Regime: Initial historical samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) show a mean of approximately 100 units/period with some volatility. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 will arrive in P3 (Arrive P1+2=3, seen in P4). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current inventory is 0. With a total lead time logic of L+1 (3 periods), I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is ~100. For 3 periods, that's ~300 units. e) Final Order Logic: Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must place a large order immediately to build inventory. To cover Periods 1, 2, and 3 (and account for the lag before the next order can arrive), I will target slightly above the average to mitigate stockout risks given the upward trend in the last sample (134).",
