The pipeline (In-transit: 500) consists of orders from P11 (210 units), P12 (50 units), and P13 (120 units), plus presumably a lost shipment from P6 (70 units) and P10 (0 ordered). Since P11 (210 units) is now at Period 3 of its lead time (L=3 is the historical max), and P12/P13 are within the window, I expect at least 210 units to arrive this period (P14) or next (P15). However, including P14's order, I need to cover demand for P14, P15, and P16 (L+1 periods). Total demand expectation for 3 periods is ~300. Adjusted pipeline (500 units - 70 lost from P6 = 430 units) already covers the next few periods' demand and safety stock significantly. No new order is placed to avoid excessive holding costs as the pipeline clears.",

[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Lukas, here's my plan for Period 38:

**Rationale:**
- **Demand Analysis:** Recent demand (P33-P37) has been volatile: 152, 63, 157, 57, 130. The average demand remains around 100-110 units per period. I'll forecast Period 38 at ~120 to be safe, given recent spikes.
- **Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis:** The promised lead time is 2, but actuals oscillate between 1 and 3. Orders exceeding L=3 are historically lost (P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33).
- **Current Pipeline Status:** Total in-transit is 1460, but most of this is "ghost" inventory from lost orders.
  - P33 (120 units) is now L=5 and confirmed lost.
  - P37 order (130 units) is the only reliable in-transit shipment.
  - All other units (1460 - 130 - 120 = 1210) are from much older, lost shipments (P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30).
- **Inventory Position:** On-hand is 203. Reliable pipeline is 130 (from P37). Total reliable stock = 333.
- **Decision Logic:** To cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at an average demand of 120, I need ~360 units. With 333 reliable units available, I will order a standard replenishment of 130 to maintain a safety buffer against the high rate of lost shipments.

**Carry-over Insight:**
- P33 order (120 units) confirmed lost/severely delayed (entered P38 without arrival, L=5). Reliable pipeline calculations now only include the P37 order and the current P38 order. Total "ghost" inventory in the system exceeds 1300 units.

The reliable in-transit pipeline consists of P44 (130), P45 (130), P46 (80), P47 (80), and P48 (80). Based on the stabilized lead time of 1-3 periods, P44-P46 (total 340 units) are highly likely to arrive in P49 or P50. Specifically, P44 is now 5 periods old (L=5) and P45 is 4 periods old (L=4); while L=5 is rare for successful orders, the lead time variation has been high. However, even if they are delayed, the earlier stock (P46-P48) and current on-hand (28) are intended to satisfy the remaining two periods of demand (approx 180 total). Since the game ends at Period 50, any inventory arriving after Period 50 or remaining at end-of-day 50 incurs holding costs without potential for profit. Given the current on-hand (28) plus the high probability of at least one of the recent large orders (P44/P45/P46) arriving in the final two days, the current pipeline is more than sufficient. Ordering more would likely only result in excess ending inventory and holding cost penalties.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized to an average of approximately 85-95 units per period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1,960 units is heavily inflated by historically lost shipments (calculated as ~1,460 units including P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37, and P38). The functional pipeline consists of orders from P44 to P48, totaling 500 units (P44:130, P45:130, P46:80, P47:80, P48:80). Order P44 (ordered P44, now P50) is 6 periods old and likely lost, while P45 (5 periods old) is at high risk. Based on an L=3 lead time, we need to cover demand for Periods 50, 51, 52, and 53 (approx. 400 units). With 0 on-hand and only P46-P48 (240 units) plus a potential P45 (130 units) in the reliable pipeline, the inventory position is precarious. However, this is Period 50 of 50. Since this is the final period and orders placed now (P50) will arrive in Period 51 or later (after the game ends), there is no benefit to ordering. The goal is to maximize Period 50 profit; any units ordered now are costs incurred without potential for sale.",
