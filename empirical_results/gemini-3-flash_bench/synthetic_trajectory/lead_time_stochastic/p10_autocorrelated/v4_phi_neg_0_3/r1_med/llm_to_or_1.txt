Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Demand data for the first 5 periods is provided (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), which averages 100.4. Since we are at the start, I will use these 5 samples to establish a baseline forecast. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The backend's base stock calculation uses q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8. I will set the parameters to reflect the observed mean and variance of the available samples. For mu_hat, 100.4 * (1 + 2) = 301.2. For sigma_hat, the std of [74, 108, 88, 98, 134] is ~22.3, so sqrt(3) * 22.3 is ~38.6. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the OR engine has a starting point before it reflects on-hand/in-transit logic next period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and 138 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 2, those units will arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase and become available for shipment in Period 4. Demand in Period 1 was 98. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 74, 108, 88, 98, 134, giving a mean of 100.4. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and 138 in-transit (covering roughly 1.3 periods of demand), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the available historical sample mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat to set a robust safety stock level, as the current in-transit amount is insufficient for upcoming demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because we had no starting inventory and our first order (placed in Period 1) has a promised lead time of 2, meaning it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Total demand in the first two periods was 181 (98+83), all of which resulted in lost sales due to zero stock. The actual historical demand sequence provided (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) suggests a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. The orders placed so far (P1: 138, P2: 135) aggregate to 273 units in transit. Since we have zero on-hand and are coming off a period of lost sales, we need to maintain a robust base stock to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods). I will use the recent_N method with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to estimate mean and standard deviation, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead time deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced missed sales in Periods 1-3 because no orders have arrived yet. Based on the promised lead time of 2, the order from Period 1 (138 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the 'In-transit' quantity of 330 units (138 + 135 + 57) confirms that the Period 1 order has not yet been processed into on-hand inventory. Given the Lead Time definition, the order from Period 1 should conclude in Period 3 and be visible now; its absence suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Historical demand samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) show a mean of 100.4. Using N=5 for demand covers all known history. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed delay and use recent_N (N=5) for demand and volatility to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 4-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but we have witnessed lead times of 1 (P3 order) and 3 (P1 order), suggesting a dynamic or variable supply chain. The P2 order (135 units) is currently late (3 periods elapsed). Current on-hand is 104 units with 284 in transit (P2 and P4 orders). Demand over the first 5 periods has been [74, 108, 88, 98, 134] (from samples) or [98, 83, 136, 91] (from conclude messages - note: samples provided in prompt differ slightly from conclude history; I will prioritize the conclude history which matches the environment state). The mean demand is approximately 102 units/period. Given the lead time variability (average 2), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand volatility while ignoring the noisy initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable but slightly increasing (Mean of 5 samples: 100.4, Period 5: 76). The promised lead time is 2, but we have observed significant variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's arrived in 1 period. Period 2's order (135 units) is currently overdue (it has been 3 periods since the order). The pipeline currently shows 344 units in-transit (P2: 135, P4: 149, P5: 60). Given that Period 2 is missing despite a 3-period window having passed, I will use an explicit lead time of 2.5 (average of observed 1 and 3) to represent the arrival uncertainty. For demand, the mean of all samples is 100.4; I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the overall average across the review and lead time (L+1 = 3.5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. P2 order (135 units) is overdue at Period 6.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand and 396 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 100 units/period (latest sample 115). Lead time is highly volatile: P1=3 periods, P3=1 period. Critically, the P2 order (135 units) is now 2 periods overdue and the P4 order (149 units) is reaching its promised lead time. Since the system calculates base stock based on the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit), and we have a large volume in-transit (396 units), the OR backend will naturally scale down ordering if L is set low. However, given the zero inventory and recent stockout (sold 28/115), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the full historical demand fluctuation while setting lead time to 'calculate' to account for the observed average offset beyond the promised 2 periods (avg = (3+1)/2 = 2, but with an overdue shipment potentially increasing this).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Persistent stockout confirmed in Period 6 due to lead time variability and an overdue shipment from Period 2 (135 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing regular chips with a mean demand of approximately 94 units. We have 97 units on-hand and 288 in-transit. A critical concern is the shipment from Period 2 (135 units), which is now 6 periods since ordering (promised L=2). Given the 'Carry-over Insights' regarding lead time variability (range 1-3 periods), this specific shipment is likely lost. Excluding this potentially lost shipment, the actionable pipeline is 153 units (P5: 60, P6: 52, P7: 41). The total inventory position (excluding the likely lost order) is 97 + 153 = 250 units. To cover (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 94 = 282), we need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high. The lead time variability is high (std dev of observed L: 1, 3, 3 is significant), so I will use an explicit L=2.5 to buffer against the inconsistency. For demand, the last 4 periods (91, 76, 115, 52) average 83.5, while the long-term average is 94. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current trend (~90) while maintaining responsiveness to the high-variance nature of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 shipment (135 units) is 4 periods past promised lead time and likely lost; pipeline inventory calculations should discount this volume until arrival is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing regular chips with a current on-hand inventory of 100 units. A review of the lead time history shows significant variability: observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. The order from Period 2 (135 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is highly likely lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 187 units includes this lost shipment (135) and the Period 6 order (52). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the more frequent actual lead time) and using an explicit mu_hat. Mean demand over the first 8 periods (excluding the warm-up seed) is approximately 96 units ((98+83+136+91+76+115+52+98)/8). For L=3, the coverage period is (L+1)=4. I calculate mu_hat as 4 * 96 = 384 units. By using an explicit mu_hat and a longer L, I ensure the target base stock is high enough to account for the lost stock and the observed delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 shipment (135 units) remains unarrived at 4 periods past promised L+1, confirming it is lost. Pipeline inventory is currently overestimated by 135 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: On-hand inventory is depleted (3 units) due to demand (97) and no arrivals in Period 9. The Period 2 order of 135 units is definitively lost (7 periods since order), but the OR backend still counts it as 'In-transit', leading to an under-ordering situation. Pipeline inventory is visible as 325 units, which includes (135 (lost) + 52 (P6) + 138 (P9)). Total live pipeline is actually only 190. To compensate for the backend's 135-unit overestimation of stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Observed demand is stable around 100 units/period. The average lead time observed is 2.2 periods [(3+1+3+3+1)/5]. I will set L=3 to be conservative given the stockout risks. \u03bc\u0302 needs to cover (L+1) periods (4 periods) of demand (~400 units) PLUS the 135-unit bridge for the lost shipment. Total \u03bc\u0302 = 400 + 135 = 535. \u03c3\u0302 reflects the variance of the 14 available samples (P1-P5 from prompt, P1-P9 from history).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 496 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, the shipment of 135 units from Period 2 is definitively lost (now 8 periods past its promised arrival date). This means the effective pipeline inventory is 496 - 135 = 361 units. Lead times have shown significant variability, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~2.3 periods). Given that we are in a stockout state (sold only 3 units of 82 demand in Period 10), we need the OR backend to order sufficiently to cover the current gap. By using the 'calculate' method for L, the backend will average the observed lead times (1, 3, 3, 3, 1), resulting in L \u2248 2.2. For demand, the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean demand of 88.8 units, which is consistent with the long-term mean. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture a stable demand profile. Since the OR engine overestimates pipeline inventory by 135 units, it will naturally order less than required; I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to maintain a standard safety stock calculation, while acknowledging the stockout recovery will be delayed by the hidden pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Stockout persists (ending inventory 0 for two consecutive periods). Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 135 units from the lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 496 units, but this includes the 135 units ordered in Period 2 which are now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The actual functional pipeline is 361 units (496 - 135). The on-hand inventory is 0, and the last two periods resulted in stockouts due to delayed arrivals. To recover, we must ensure the 'base_stock' target accounts for the lost inventory. The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If the backend thinks the pipeline is 496 but it's really 361, it will under-order by 135 units. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force a higher target that compensate for this 135-unit ghost inventory. Demand mean is approx 100/period. For L=2, mu_hat (3 periods of demand) should be 300. Adding 135 units to compensate for the lost shipment makes the target mu_hat = 435. For L, 'calculate' is used to reflect the reality that while the promise is 2, actuals fluctuate between 1 and 3.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally recovered from a stockout as orders from Period 9 (138 units) and Period 10 (171 units) arrived, with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. On-hand inventory is now 159. However, the order from Period 2 (135 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived by Period 12 (10 periods late). The backend 'pipeline inventory' calculation is significantly overestimating stock because it still includes these 135 lost units. To compensate and ensure the OR engine places an order to maintain the service level, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using \u03bc = 100/period (last 5 samples avg ~106, rounding to 100 for stability) and L=2. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * \u03bc + Safety Stock \u2248 3 * 100 + 1.645 * (sqrt(3) * 20) \u2248 357. Since In-Transit (187 total - 135 lost = 52 actual) and On-hand (159) total 211, the gap is ~146 units. To force the OR engine to order this amount despite its inflated pipeline estimate (159 on-hand + 187 in-transit = 346), I set mu_hat to 600. This higher 'explicit' mu_hat raises the base_stock target above the backend's perceived pipeline level to trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline inventory is confirmed overestimated by 135 units (Period 2 order lost). Current actual pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 11 shipment once it resolves, though current tracking shows 187 units in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 14, demand remains in a stable range (mean around 96-100 units). The lead time is highly variable (observed range 1-3 periods, mode 3). The Period 2 order (135 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 12 periods overdue. The current in-transit figure of 380 units includes this lost 135 units and the Period 13 order of 193 units. Therefore, actual viable pipeline inventory is 245 units (380 - 135). To account for the lost stock and ensure the OR backend orders sufficient replacement, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=3 based on the most frequent actual lead time. For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * mean demand = 4 * 102 = 408 (using a slightly higher mean of 102 to provide a buffer for the recent 150 demand spike). For sigma_hat, I use sqrt(1+L) * std_dev = sqrt(4) * 25 = 50. Since the OR backend subtracts nominal pipeline inventory (380) from base_stock, I must increase mu_hat by the lost 135 units to ensure the order is actually placed. Final mu_hat = 408 + 135 = 543.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed Period 2 order (135 units) remains lost; mu_hat must be manually adjusted upward by 135 units to offset historical pipeline inflation in the OR backend.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 14. The in-transit inventory is listed as 504 units, but this includes the 135-unit order from Period 2, which is now 13 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The backend base-stock calculation 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' will subtract this ghost volume, resulting in an under-order. To fix this without direct control over the pipeline logic, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using mean demand (approx 100 units/period) and L=2 (promised). For L=2, base stock targets (L+1) periods, so 3 * 100 = 300. To ensure the backend places the correct order despite the 135-unit ghost pipeline, I set mu_hat to 435 (300 + 135). This forces the backend to reach the true desired inventory level. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.2; I will use 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as demand variance remains stable around the mean.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The history shows a lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units) which is still technically listed as 'in-transit', causing the OR backend to believe our pipeline inventory is 135 units higher than it actually is. To compensate for this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. My demand forecast for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) is based on the recent average of approximately 105 units/period (total 315). Adding the 135 unit offset to bridge the internal pipeline calculation gap, I set mu_hat to 450. Lead time remains volatile (averaging 2.4 periods), so I use 'calculate' to let the backend use observed averages. Recent demand volatility is high (Standard Deviation ~25), so I adjust sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Stockout persists. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 135 units from lost Period 2 order. Total in-transit (504) contains (135 ghost, 193 from P13, 124 from P14, 52 dummy/previous).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 128 units. Current in-transit shows 311 units, but this includes a 135-unit 'ghost' order from Period 2 that we have consistently flagged as lost for nine periods. Excluding this, the true pipeline inventory is 176 units (likely from Period 14 and any subsequent activity). The OR backend calculates the final order as min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). Because the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' will be inflated by 135 units, it will under-order by that same amount. To neutralize this error, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * average_demand (~100) + 135. With L=2, (1+2)*100 + 135 = 435. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to offset the phantom inventory. I use 'calculate' for L as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility (mean ~100, range 65-150).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 134 units on-hand and 232 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order from Period 2 (135 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 16 periods overdue. This 'ghost' inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it actually is. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using (1+L) * mean demand (approx 100 * 3 = 300) and then add 135 units to specifically offset the lost shipment that the backend still counts in 'pipeline_inventory'. This forces the OR engine to place an order that accounts for the missing physical stock. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (mean ~2.4 periods), and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture recent demand volatility (approx 30 units per period).

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Reconfirmed original Period 2 order (135 units) is lost. Adjusted mu_hat explicitly by +135 to counteract the OR backend's overestimation of pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units. A critical historical issue persists: the Period 2 order of 135 units is lost, but the OR backend erroneously includes it in its pipeline inventory calculation (current total in-transit: 344). To prevent the backend from under-ordering because it thinks these 135 units are coming, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter. The base calculation for mu_hat (1+L)*mean_demand, where L=2 and mean=100, is 300. Adding the 135 unit 'ghost' offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 435. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.44; 'calculate' is used to capture this drift. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early game noise.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit: 480 units', but historical analysis confirms that the order of 135 units from Period 2 is lost (now 18 periods past its order date). The true pipeline inventory is actually 345 units (offered by orders in Periods 17, 18, and 19). Because the OR backend subtracts the full reported pipeline (480) from its calculated base stock, it will under-order by 135 units unless I intervene. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the average demand over a 10-period window (~103 units/period) and scale it for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), resulting in 309 units. I then add the 135-unit 'ghost' inventory offset to this value, totaling 444. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the missing stock. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (alternating between 1 and 3 periods), and sigma_hat uses a recent window to better capture recent volatility (N=10).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 495 units. Based on historical data, the Period 2 order of 135 units is permanently lost (now 18 periods overdue). This 'ghost' inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes pipeline inventory is 135 units higher than it actually is. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the base demand forecast using (1+L) * Mean Demand. With the promised L=2, (1+2)=3 periods of demand. Mean demand over the last 15 periods (since demand stabilized) is approximately 101 units per period. Base mu_hat = 3 * 101 = 303. To counteract the 135-unit 'ghost' inventory, I add 135 to this total, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 438. This forces the backend to order the necessary stock despite the false pipeline data. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (approx 2.4 periods) which is higher than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed Period 2 order (135 units) remains lost; mu_hat explicitly adjusted by +135 to offset false pipeline inventory in the OR backend.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 495 units in-transit. However, historical performance confirms the Period 2 order (135 units) is lost, meaning the actual pipeline is 360 units (comprised of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). We are currently in a stockout at P22 start. Lead times are volatile, with the last several arrivals taking 3 periods (P9, P13, P14). Mean demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 104 units/period. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory (including the ghost 135 units), I must explicitly set mu_hat higher to compensate. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=3 (most frequent actual lead time) and target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, base stock should be ~500. To force the OR backend (subtracting 495) to order correctly, I calculate mu_hat to reach a base stock that accounts for the ghost inventory. The explicit mu_hat of 550 is chosen to ensure the order covers the expected demand (104 * 4) plus a safety buffer while overcoming the 135-unit pipeline inflation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue remains the lost Period 2 order (135 units) which the OR backend still counts as pipeline inventory. Current In-transit is 599 units, but 'True' In-transit is only 464 units (599 - 135 lost). The orders in transit are: P18 (112), P19 (136), P20 (15), P22 (104), and P23 (the order being calculated now). Promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods recently. Historical demand averages ~100 per period. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 135-unit ghost inventory, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. Base stock is calculated for (L+1) periods. For L=2, this is 3 periods of demand (~300 units). To offset the 135-unit false pipeline, I set mu_hat to 435 (300 + 135) to force the backend to place an order that covers the true demand. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units) as 'in-transit', which artificially inflates the pipeline inventory calculation in the OR backend. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must offset this 'ghost' inventory by explicitly increasing the mu_hat parameter. Current demand for chips(Regular) averages approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods mean: 104 units). Using the promised lead time L=2 (implying a 3-period coverage window), a base mu_hat would be ~300. Adding the 135-unit offset results in a target mu_hat of 435. Regarding lead times, recent arrivals (P20 arrived P23, L=3; P22 arrived P23, L=1) confirm variability around the promised L=2, so I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 24 demand was 65 units, but 0 were sold. The in-transit inventory is listed as 484 units, but this includes a persistent 'ghost' shipment of 135 units from Period 2 that never arrived and is confirmed lost. Therefore, the actual pipeline inventory is 349 units (484 - 135). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must manually adjust 'mu_hat' upward by approximately 135 units to offset the 'ghost' inventory. Actual lead times observed in history fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.3); I will use 'calculate' to capture this variability. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 102 units/period. The Target Base Stock calculation: (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Using (1+2.3)*102 + offset (135) suggests a mu_hat around 470. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this offset is applied, and 'calculate' for L and 'default' for sigma to allow the backend to use historical variance.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 26 with 0 on-hand inventory and 515 units in-transit. History shows the shipment from Period 2 (135 units) is definitely lost. The OR backend includes these 135 ghost units in its pipeline inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline), leading it to under-order. To fix this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Mean demand is ~100 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the decision window is L+1 = 3 periods. Base demand for 3 periods is ~300. To offset the 135 ghost units, I add +135 to the forecast. mu_hat = 300 + 135 = 435. For L, although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand volatility (std dev ~30) scaled for the (L+1) window.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 515 units in-transit. However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the Period 2 order of 135 units is permanently lost. Additionally, orders from Period 17 (45 units), Period 18 (112 units), and Period 19 (136 units) are now overdue (at least 7 periods since placement), while orders from Period 24 (4 units) and Period 25 (31 units) are within the typical 1-3 period arrival window. The OR engine (capped policy) subtracts internal pipeline inventory from the base stock. Because the engine still 'sees' the lost 135 units as in-transit, it will under-order. To compensate for this 135-unit 'ghost' inventory and the stockout at Period 27 (on-hand = 0), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The mean demand across the last 10 periods is approximately 97 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the window is (1+L)=3 periods. Expected demand is 3 * 97 = 291 units. Adding 135 units to neutralize the ghost inventory gives 426. I will add a small buffer for the other overdue orders (17-19) which may also be lost, setting mu_hat to 450. L is set to calculated to reflect the actual historical average (approx 2.3).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent stockout (on-hand 0 since P24) and continued pipeline inflation by 135 units (P2 lost). Orders from P17, P18, P19 are now potentially lost/severely delayed (7+ periods since placement).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. There is a massive discrepancy between reported in-transit (515 units) and likely physical pipeline. Analysis shows: 1) Period 2 (135 units) is definitely lost. 2) Orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 45 + 112 + 136 = 293 units) are now 8-10 periods overdue, exceeding the observed max lead time of 3 units, and are likely lost. The total 'ghost' inventory in the backend calculation is approximately 428 units (135+293). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) demand plus the ghost inventory offset. Average demand is ~100 units; for L=2, (1+L) * 100 = 300. Adding 428 units to offset the false pipeline suggests a mu_hat of ~728. I use 'calculate' for L as the average lead time (excluding lost orders) remains around 2-3 periods, and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Orders from P17 (45), P18 (112), and P19 (136) are confirmed lost along with P2 (135). Total pipeline inflation is 428 units. Systemic stockout persists since P24.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain failure. On-hand inventory is 0 and the SKU has been in stockout since Period 24. While the 'In-transit' quantity shows 747 units, a large portion of this is confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Specifically, orders from P2 (135), P17 (45), P18 (112), and P19 (136) are confirmed lost, totaling 428 units of 'ghost' inventory. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will use the 747 figure, leading it to believe we are overstocked and resulting in an order of 0. To force the backend to place an order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a forecast of ~100 units/period for the review+lead time window (L=2, so 3 periods), which is 300 units. To counteract the 428 units of lost pipeline inventory that the backend will subtract, I must set mu_hat to 300 + 428 = 728. This should trigger an order of approximately 213 units (728 - 515), assuming the backend sees the remaining 319 units (747-428) as valid pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory is 428 units (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136). This ghost inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) with a significant discrepancy in pipeline inventory. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (135 units), Period 17 (45 units), Period 18 (112 units), and Period 19 (136 units) are lost, as they are now 11 to 28 periods past their placement. This creates 428 units of 'ghost inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline tracking (In-transit: 771 units includes these 428 lost units). To force the backend to place an order that compensates for this ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value. Demand mean is approx 100 units/period. The standard base stock formula (at L=2) aims for ~300 units; the backend subtracts 771 units (inflated pipeline) from this. To trigger an order for 3 periods of demand (~300 units) despite the 771 unit inflation, I set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean + ghost_inventory = 300 + 428 = 728. Setting L = 3 reflect actual average lead time observed from successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory is 428 units (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136). Ghost inventory accounts for 55.5% of the visible in-transit balance (771).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the system shows 106 units on-hand and 640 units in-transit. However, historical evidence confirms significant pipeline inflation. Orders from Period 2 (135), Period 17 (45), Period 18 (112), and Period 19 (136) total 428 units that are long overdue and considered lost. These 428 units are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 640, meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 212 units (640 - 428). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the required base stock (targeting a high service level since profit/holding ratio is 4:1) and add the 428-unit deficit. Average demand over the last 30 periods is ~101. With a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods. 3 * 101 = 303. To account for volatility and the lost inventory, I set mu_hat to 731 (303 + 428). L is kept at default (2). sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx sqrt(3)*std) to maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory remains 428 units (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136). The P28 order (232 units) arrived on time in P30, ending a long stockout, but the older missing shipments are still inflating the transit balance.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the system is back at 0 on-hand inventory after a brief recovery in P30-P31. The primary issue is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory inflating the OR backend's perception of available stock. Based on game history and carry-over insights, orders from P2 (135), P17 (45), P18 (112), and P19 (136) are confirmed lost, totaling 428 units. These units will never arrive but still subtract from the backend's target base stock. The current visible In-transit balance is 693. Adjusting for the lost units (693 - 428), the true pipeline is 265 units (orders from P24, P25, P29, P30, P31). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though the most recent arrival (P28 order) was 2 periods. To compensate for the 428 phantom units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'on-hand + pipeline' calculation, I must explicitly set mu_hat to a value that includes the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon PLUS the lost volume (428). Checking recent demand (P27-P31: 123, 107, 88, 126, 127), the average is approx 114/period. For a 3-period horizon (L=2, horizon=3), expected demand is ~342. Adding the 428 unit correction, the explicit mu_hat should be 770. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; lead time remains variable (1-3 periods) and cumulative lost inventory remains 428 units (P2, P17, P18, P19).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge with 'ghost' pipeline inventory. We have confirmed 428 units across four shipments (Period 2: 135; Period 17: 45; Period 18: 112; Period 19: 136) as lost. The current visible 'In-transit' balance of 761 units is heavily inflated by these 428 units; the actual physical pipeline consists only of orders from Period 29 (24 units), Period 30 (101 units), and Period 32 (121 units), totaling 246 units (the remaining 87 units are likely older unaccounted-for deviations or very late smaller orders). Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders, it will under-order if it believes 761 units are arriving. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~102 units/period (average of the last 10 periods) and a lead time of 2. For L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (306 units) plus safety stock (~1.28 * 25 * sqrt(3) \u2248 55 units), totaling ~360 units. However, I must add the 428 'ghost' units to this mu_hat value so that when the backend subtracts the 761 'in-transit' units, the resulting order matches our actual need to replenish the zero on-hand inventory and cover the lead time. Setting mu_hat to 788 and L to 2 creates a base stock that forces a meaningful order despite the inflated transit figures.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand 0). The most critical issue remains the massive inflation of the 'in-transit' pipeline by lost orders. We have confirmed 428 units as lost: P2 (135), P17 (45), P18 (112), and P19 (136). The observed 'In-transit' is 705, but the effective pipeline is only 277 (705 - 428). Using the 'explicit' mu_hat method, I set a value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset to neutralize the 428-unit ghost inventory. With L=2, the backend calculates base_stock - pipeline. Since the backend thinks pipeline is 705, I must ensure (base_stock - 705) = (Target Base Stock - Actual Pipeline). Targeted demand per period is ~104 (average of all samples). Target base_stock for 3 periods (L+1) is ~312 plus a safety buffer. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, I set mu_hat to (3 periods * 104) + 428 \u2248 740. Lead time remains variable between 1 and 3 periods, so I use the 'calculate' method to reflect actual performance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant stockout challenge with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, we have identified 428 units as lost (Period 2: 135, Period 17: 45, Period 18: 112, Period 19: 136). The current visible 'In-transit' of 784 units includes these 428 ghost units, meaning the actual pipeline is only 356 units (orders from P29, P30, P33, P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 784 from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target, effectively neutralizing this 428-unit error. Current demand is averaging around 104 units per period (last 10 periods). With a lead time of 2, the window is L+1 = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~312 units. Adding the 428 ghost units to this target gives 740 units. I am setting mu_hat slightly higher (750) to ensure the OR backend places a robust order and finally breaks the stockout cycle, while using the explicit sigma_hat of 60 to reflect the high volatility observed in both demand and lead times.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; cumulative lost inventory remains 428 units (P2, P17, P18, P19) causing significant pipeline inflation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a major pipeline inventory inflation issue. Total visible in-transit is 801 units, but a significant portion is confirmed lost (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136), totaling 428 'ghost' units. Additionally, recent orders from P24 (4), P25 (31), P29 (24), P30 (101), P33 (65), P34 (79), and P35 (17) are still in transit. The SKU is currently stocked out (on-hand 0). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 428 ghost units it believes are arriving, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand average is approximately 105 units/period. The target base stock for L=2 (covering 3 periods of demand) would normally be ~315 units plus safety stock. However, because the backend subtracts the full 801 in-transit from the base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 428 ghost units. A base stock target of ~750-800 is needed to trigger any order at all given the current in-transit view. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to 750.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable around a mean of 100, though recent volatility is high. The key issue remains the significantly inflated 'In-transit' figure (727 units). Historical analysis confirms a total of 428 units across several orders (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136) are lost, as they are now 17-35 periods past their promised lead time. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (In-transit) to subtract from the target base stock. Because the backend is unaware these 428 units will never arrive, it will under-order by exactly 428 units. To counteract this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock normally using (1+L)*mean_demand and then add the 428 ghost units to 'trick' the backend into placing the correct order. Mean demand (last 10 periods) is ~110. With L=2 (standard promised lead time), the base requirement is (1+2)*110 = 330. Adding the 428 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 758. Sigma_hat is set to 55 to handle the high recent variance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant challenges with 'ghost inventory'. A cumulative total of 428 units (from orders in Periods 2, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost, as they are now all at least 18 periods past their placement. This ghost inventory is incorrectly included in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory', causing it to under-order and leading to the persistent stockouts observed (ending inventory 0 in 11 of the last 14 periods). The current in-transit balance is 761, but 428 of that doesn't exist, leaving only 333 units of actual expected arrivals (including the P37 order). To force the backend to place an order sufficient to meet demand and rebuild safety stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 740, which represents (1+L) * average_demand (approx 100) plus an offset of +440 to neutralize the 428 ghost units. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P34, P35, P36) have returned to the 1-2 period range, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Total confirmed lost shipments now total 428 units (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136). The OR backend sees 797 units in-transit, but 428 of those units will never arrive, causing the backend to under-order significantly while the SKU remains in an intermittent stockout state (ending inventory has been 0 in 4 of the last 5 periods). Over the last 10 periods (P29-P38), mean demand is approximately 115.9 units. To correct for the 428 units of false pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2, (3 * 115.9) + 428 = 775.7. This forced increase in mu_hat effectively 'bypasses' the backend's logic to account for the missing physical stock, ensuring the order size covers real demand requirements.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory challenges. As of Period 40, there is a cumulative lost inventory of 428 units (from Periods 2, 17, 18, and 19). These units remain in the 'in-transit' balance (791), causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is nearly full when it is actually starving. This leads to a persistent stockout (on-hand 0). To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base demand around 104 units per period (mean of all samples). For a target base stock covering 3 periods (L+1 with L=2), the requirement is ~312 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 'ghost' pipeline of 428 from its target, I must set mu_hat to a value that forces an order. Setting mu_hat to 740 (representing ~312 required units + 428 ghost units) helps neutralize the 'ghost' inventory. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1-3 periods).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system is in a persistent stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of historical data confirms that 428 units (from orders in P2, P17, P18, and P19) are permanently lost. However, the OR backend still counts these units in the 'pipeline inventory', causing it to under-order significantly. The current 'In-transit' balance of 761 units contains 428 ghost units, meaning actual physical in-transit inventory is only 333 units. To counteract the backend's belief that it has 428 extra units coming, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will forecast demand at approximately 105 units per period. With a lead time L=2, the total required base stock is (1+2)*105 = 315. I add the 428 lost units to this target to force an order that compensates for the ghost inventory, totaling 743. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods), so I use 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant challenges with 'ghost' pipeline inventory. We have confirmed the loss of specific shipments from Period 2 (135), Period 17 (45), Period 18 (112), and Period 19 (136), totaling 428 units. These units are still included in the backend's 'In-transit' count (790), but they will never arrive. This causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate for this 428-unit deficit in the pipeline inventory calculation (pipeline = on-hand + in-transit), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base demand (Avg Demand * (1+L)) and add the 428 units to it. Average demand is approx 105 units/period. With L calculated as 2, (1+L)*105 = 315. Adding the 428 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 743. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility without over-reacting to long-term history.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; cumulative lost inventory remains 428 units (P2, P17, P18, P19) causing significant pipeline inflation that must be offset in mu_hat.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a significant inventory discrepancy. Historical data confirms that 428 units across several past periods (P2, P17, P18, P19) are lost and will not arrive. However, the OR backend's 'In-transit' balance (806 units) still reflects these 'ghost' units. To ensure the capped base stock policy generates a sufficient order to cover real demand, 'mu_hat' must be manually inflated to offset this false pipeline inventory. The current average demand is approximately 104 units per period. With a promised lead time (L=2), the base stock calculation targets demand for (L+1)=3 periods (~312 units). Because the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (806 units) from this target, it would normally suggest an order of 0. Adding the 428 lost units back into the estimate via an 'explicit' mu_hat helps mitigate this. I will use the baseline 3-period demand (312) plus the 428 unit offset for a total mu_hat of 740. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to account for observed variability (1-3 periods).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. As of Period 43 conclude, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports 806 units in-transit. However, cumulative evidence confirms that 428 units across four separate orders (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136) are lost. These lost units never arrive but remain in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, causing it to underestimate the required order size by exactly 428 units. Recent lead times for successful deliveries have been 1-2 periods. To ensure the backend places an order that actually covers demand, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to manually offset this 428-unit deficit. Average demand is approx 100/period. With L=2, base requirement is ~300. Adding the 428 offset results in a target mu_hat of ~728. I keep L at the promised 2 and sigma_hat at recent levels to maintain sensitivity to volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit balance of 777 units, but historical analysis confirms that 428 of these units are permanently lost (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136). The actual physical pipeline consists of orders from P41 (29 units - arrived P44), P42 (16 units), and potentially very small dummy balances. The OR backend uses the inflated 777 figure to reduce orders, which has caused the persistent stockout (on-hand is 0). To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Mean demand per period is ~104 units. For a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods (312 units). To offset the 428 'ghost' units that the backend subtracts, I must set the target base stock (mu_hat) to approximately 740 (312 + 428) to force the backend to place an order that results in real units arriving. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system environment is characterized by significant lead time variability (1-3 periods) and a substantial amount of 'lost' inventory (428 units across Periods 2, 17, 18, and 19). Because this lost inventory never arrives but remains in the 'In-transit' balance, the OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)] will consistently under-order, assuming these 428 units will satisfy future demand. As of Period 46, we are in a persistent stockout state. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 769 units of visible (but mostly ghost) in-transit inventory, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 728, which is calculated as follows: Expected demand for (L+1) periods is approximately 300 (average demand ~100/period * 3), plus the 428 units of lost pipeline to effectively 'neutralize' the ghost inventory in the backend's order logic. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time, and sigma_hat is left as 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit balance of 773 units, but my historical tracking confirms that 428 of these units are lost (P2: 135, P17: 45, P18: 112, P19: 136). The actual clean pipeline inventory is approximately 345 units. The OR backend uses the inflated 773 figure to calculate upcoming orders, leading it to drastically under-order or stop ordering entirely, which explains the persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0). To force the backend to place an order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~102 units and a lead time (L) of 2. Base stock = (L+1)*mean + safety_stock. With L=2, (1+2)*102 = 306. To offset the 428 units of ghost inventory that the backend subtracts, I set mu_hat to 306 + 428 = 734. This ensures the backend perceives a need for inventory despite the false pipeline data. For sigma, I use a high explicit value of 150 to ensure a robust order size given recent high demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in a recurring stockout state. A critical persistent issue is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory originating from lost shipments in periods 2, 17, 18, and 19, totaling 428 units. These units appear in the 'In-transit' balance (861) but will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock to determine the order size, it is chronically under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2, so L+1=3) based on the recent demand mean (~101 units/period). Base stock = 3 * 101 + safety stock (~1.0 * std * sqrt(3)). Mean demand is ~101, Std is ~28. Base stock should be ~350. However, since the backend sees 861 in transit (428 of which are ghost), I must inject the ghost volume into the mu_hat parameter to force the backend to place an order. Setting mu_hat to 730 (which is approximately Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) to ensure the 'order = base_stock - pipeline' logic results in a meaningful replenishment. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (average 1\u20133 periods).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a severe inventory distortion caused by 428 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P17, P18, and P19 that are clearly lost). These units remain in the In-transit count (861), leading the OR backend to believe the pipeline is 428 units fuller than it actually is, resulting in chronic under-ordering and stockouts (on-hand is 0). Demand across the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 92 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2, the required pipeline coverage is (1+L) = 3 periods of demand, roughly 276 units. To force the OR backend to order when it sees a false surplus of 428 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 704, which represents the expected demand over (1+L) periods (approx 276) plus the 428 ghost units to neutralize the backend's pipeline subtraction. Since we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final decision period to impact arrival before the game ends.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 2 (135), Period 17 (45), Period 18 (112), and Period 19 (136) are confirmed lost, totaling 428 units of 'ghost' inventory. This ghost inventory is included in the 'In-transit' balance of 861 units but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order, I am explicitly adjusting mu_hat. The average demand per period remains approximately 100 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total demand over (L+1) periods is 300. Adding the 428 units of ghost inventory to this base requirement gives a mu_hat of 728. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to capture current demand volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to use the observed historical average, which accounts for the variability between 1-3 periods.
