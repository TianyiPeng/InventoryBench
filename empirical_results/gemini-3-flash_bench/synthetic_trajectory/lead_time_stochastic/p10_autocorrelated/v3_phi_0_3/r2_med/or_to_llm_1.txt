The historical demand samples reflect a range between 80 and 177 units, with an average of approximately 118 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. Until then, we must rely on initial stock (which is currently 0) and any orders currently in transit (also 0). Looking at Period 1 specifically, demand will resolve after our decision; however, since on-hand is 0 and lead time is 2, we are guaranteed to stock out until the first order arrives. The OR algorithm recommends 180 units based on a base-stock policy (\u03bc=118, \u03c3\u224838, q=0.8, z*\u22480.84), calculating a required inventory level to cover roughly 3 periods (L+1).

Historical average demand (including pre-game samples) is approximately 104 units. Total demand for the risk horizon (L+1 = 3 periods) is roughly 312 units.\n3.

We have experienced stockouts (sold=0) in the first three periods because no inventory has arrived yet. 3.

However, since we are currently out of stock and the first order (P1) hasn't arrived by the expected time (Period 4 start), we are in a critical stockout phase. While the pipeline is large, we need to ensure we don't fall further behind if demand spikes.

This indicates high lead-time variability. The Period 2 order (172 units) is still in-transit and has now reached its 3rd period; it is expected to arrive during the current Period 5.\n2. **Inventory Position**: Starting on-hand is 81. In-transit is 172 (the Period 2 order). Total pipeline inventory is 253. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (P1-P4) averages ~115 units/period. The current period (P5) demand is 177 (as per provided sample data), which is a significant spike. This suggests a potential shift to a higher demand regime or a seasonal peak.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 139 units. The OR base-stock calculation uses an average demand (~115) and promised lead time (2). However, recent demand (177) is much higher, and lead-time is unstable. If demand sustains at ~170, the required inventory for the lead-time window (L+1=3) is 510 units. With 253 currently available/in-transit and the OR ordering 139, the total would be 392, which risks a stockout if the Period 2 shipment is lost or delayed further.

P20 (186), P21 (167), and P22 (120) average 157.6 units/period, compared to the long-term average of ~105. This suggests a demand regime shift or seasonal peak. \n4.

However, the system has seen no arrivals for the last 5 periods (P18-P22), indicating a severe delivery bottleneck or systemic loss. \n5. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from the inflated pipeline (902 units) and a safety factor that doesn't account for recent demand surges. Given that we have 0 on-hand and recent demand is ~150/period, relying on the 'In-transit' count is dangerous.

Given the observed lead time of 1-2 periods (as seen in Periods 23 and 25), the order from Period 24 (placed 3 periods ago) is slightly overdue or arriving now, Period 25 (2 periods ago) is due, and Period 26 (1 period ago) is upcoming.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P20-P26) has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 140 units per period (186, 167, 120, 133, 112, 147, 120). \n4. **Critical OR Baseline Issue**: The OR recommendation is 0, because it sees a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1107 without accounting for lost shipments.
