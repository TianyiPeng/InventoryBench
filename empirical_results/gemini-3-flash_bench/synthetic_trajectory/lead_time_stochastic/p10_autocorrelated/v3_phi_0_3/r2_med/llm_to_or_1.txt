Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows demand values of 80, 120, 120, 93, and 177. The prometed lead time is 2 periods. Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the priority is to avoid stockouts. I will use the mean of the available 5 historical samples to set the initial demand forecast. Mean = (80+120+120+93+177)/5 = 118. Total demand over (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 3 * 118 = 354. I will use the standard deviation of these samples for volatility. Std \u2248 36.9, so sigma_hat over the lead time is sqrt(3) * 36.9 \u2248 64. I'll rely on recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 5 available samples to baseline the system.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time (L) is 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units. Based on the logic that L=2 means the order arrives during Period (N+L) resolution and becomes visible at the start of (N+L+1), we expect the P1 order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 180 in-transit. Demand for Period 1 was 106, which is consistent with the initial historical samples (80-120). I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture recent history (including the 5 initial samples + Period 1 demand = 6 samples total). Since we have no lead time observations yet, I will use the default promised lead time and default variance calculation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (provided in history) was 80, 120, 120, 93, 177. However, the game state report shows Period 1 demand was 106 and Period 2 was 111. I will focus on the game state demand. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (180 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in P4's start. Order placed in P2 (172 units) is expected in P4. Total in-transit is 352. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have lost sales because arrivals haven't happened yet. This is consistent with L=2. I will use recent_N=2 to capture the current demand level (~108.5 per period). Since the horizon for base stock is (L+1), and L=2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods. Using the 'default' or 'recent_N' methods automatically scales by (1+L) in the backend.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, making them visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows 0 arrived, meaning the Period 1 order is delayed. Since it hasn't arrived by the start of Period 4, the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. This delay has resulted in several periods of zero sales despite steady demand (approx 108 units/period). I will set L to 3 to account for this observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the historical samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and recent period demands (106, 111, 107) suggest a stable mean around 110. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent stability. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 180 units not arrived by start of Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we finally have confirmation on lead time. The order from Period 1 arrived in the arrival phase of Period 4 (visible at start of Period 5), confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. Demand has shown a slight upward trend (106, 111, 107, 138), with the most recent sample being the highest. To account for the confirmed longer lead time (L=3) and the recent increase in demand, I am setting L to 3 explicitly. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime which averages ~115 units per period. This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L)*demand covers 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 4); Demand showing upward trend, avg ~115 over last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zero with 398 units in transit. Historical analysis reveals the actual lead time (L) is 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Demand history (samples provided: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177; conclude messages: 106, 111, 107, 138, 103) shows a combined average of approximately 115 units per period. In Period 5, we stocked out, suggesting that previous parameters were too thin for the actual 3-period lead time. I am setting L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the conclude message demand history) to capture the current mean of 113.8, which the OR backend will multiply by (1+L=4) to target a pipeline of ~455 units. Given the stockout and the lead time delay, this helps ensure we recover from the current zero-inventory state and meet future demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized around 114 units/period over the last 5 periods; Lead time remains confirmed at 3 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 0. Period 6 observation shows a significant demand drop to 42 units (from an average of ~114), but this is likely an outlier. The carry-over insight confirms a lead time (L) of 3 periods (not the promised 2). Reviewing order history: P1 (180 units) arrived P4 (LT=3); P2 (172 units) was ordered in Period 2 and is expected to arrive in Period 5 (it did not, as visible in P5 conclude) or Period 6 (it did not, as visible in P6 conclude). Since P2 hasn't arrived by the start of P7, the lead time for P2 is already \u2265 4 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. However, looking at the pipeline: P2(172), P4(85), P5(141), and P6(79) are in-transit (Total 477). I will set L=3 as the most reliable estimate based on the only confirmed arrival. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (before the P6 drop) was ~114. Including P6 (42), the 6-period average is ~101. Given the volatility, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the recent mean shift while smoothing the P6 outlier. This results in mu_hat = (1+3)*mean(P1-P6).

Carry-over insight: Lead time for P2 order (172 units) has exceeded 4 periods (ordered P2, not arrived by P7 start), suggesting potential delivery instability or lead-time extension beyond 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face significant supply chain instability. The Period 2 order (172 units) is now 5 periods overdue, and the Period 5 order (141 units) is also missing. While Period 1 and Period 4 orders arrived with a lead time (L) of 3, the current pipeline is clogged with unfulfilled orders. On-hand inventory is critically low (2 units) after many lost sales. Although the 'promised' lead time is 2, historical arrivals show 3, and current performance suggests even longer or lost shipments. I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent reality of the fulfilled orders, but I must boost mu_hat to account for the pipeline instability and high cost of stockouts (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1). Demand has averaged 98.5 units over the last 7 periods, but removing the early period zero-stock data, it's roughly 110. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent mean (~101), resulting in a mu_hat covering L+1=4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Period 2 order (ordered P2) has not arrived by P8 start (5+ periods); actual lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $376.00, Daily Holding Cost: $49.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last five periods (P4-P8), demand has averaged 92 units per period (138, 103, 42, 83, 94). Removing the lower outlier in P6 (demand 42) gives an average of ~104.5. Given the recent demand and historical baseline, I will use a conservative N=5 to set mu_hat. Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2, but actual successful deliveries (P4, P7, P8) have consistently shown an actual LT of 3. Crucially, the order from P2 is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P2, start of P9 still not arrived), and the order from P6 is also at T+3 with no arrival yet. This suggests high instability. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to a pipeline inflated by these likely lost/delayed units, I will set L to 3 (the median observed successful lead time) and adjust the forecast to account for the risk of missing stock. mu_hat will be based on (1+3) * mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss/extreme delay detected: Period 2 order (172 units) is 6 periods overdue; Period 6 order (79 units) failed to arrive at the confirmed 3-period lead time. Pipeline inventory is currently unreliable. Lead time remains 3 periods for successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain remains highly unstable. The Period 2 and Period 6 orders are significantly overdue and likely lost. However, the Period 8 order arrived in just 1 period (observed at start of P10), while Period 4, 5, and 1 were 3 periods. This indicates high variance in lead time (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods). I will set L to 3 to be conservative, given the history of delays and lost shipments. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 over the last 6 periods (avg: 106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42?? - wait, Period 6 was weirdly low at 42, then 83, 94, 97). Excluding the outlier P6, the mean is ~105. I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand level of ~93. Given on-hand is 0 and pipeline reliability is low, I am setting L=3 specifically to prompt the OR engine to account for the longer cycle and lost orders without over-ordering if the pipeline suddenly clears.

Carry-over insight: Significant lead-time variance detected: recent arrival (P8 order) took 1 period, while previous successful arrivals (P1, P4, P5) took 3 periods. P2 and P6 orders are likely lost (overdue by 7 and 3 periods respectively). Demand remains stable near 95-100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and 359 units in-transit. Historical lead times show significant variance: P1, P4, and P5 orders took 3 periods; P8 took 1 period; while P2 (ordered P2) and P6 (ordered P6) are likely lost as they are 8 and 4 periods overdue, respectively. The promised lead time is 2, but the most frequently observed successful lead time is 3. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the most common actual delay. Recent demand (P9, P10) has dipped (97, 53) compared to the earlier average of ~110. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat yields a mean of 85.8, which better captures this recent cooling while maintaining enough stock if demand recovers. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility. The pipeline (359 units) contains likely lost units (P2 order = 172 units; P6 order = 79 units). By setting L=3, mu_hat=(1+3)*85.8=343.2. The OR backend will see pipeline (359) and likely order zero or the cap. Since I cannot 'delete' lost units from the backend's recorded pipeline, I must rely on the cap to manage risk until the 'lost' units theoretically age out or the system reconciles.

Carry-over insight: Persistent lead-time variance: deliveries occurred at 1 and 3 periods, while orders from P2 (172 units) and P6 (79 units) are confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed. Demand has softened from ~110 to ~86 over the last 5 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 359 units. Analysis of historical arrivals confirms that orders from Period 2 (172 units) and Period 6 (79 units) have been lost or are indefinitely delayed (overdue by 9 and 5 periods respectively). Successful arrivals have shown high variance, arriving in 1 or 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 359 includes the lost 251 units (172+79), meaning the functional pipeline is only 108 units (P9: 83 units, P10: 25 units). Demand has recently softened but stabilized around 82-85 units/period over the last 5 periods (mean=84.4). To account for the highly variable lead time and the risk of further lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative upper end of successful arrivals) and using a recent_N window for demand to capture the lower current average. The OR backend needs to place an order to replenish the functional pipeline, as on-hand is zero and we have experienced stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline correction: 251 units (P2 and P6 orders) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Demand stabilized at ~85 units/period over the last 5 periods (P7-P11).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 24 units. Total in-transit inventory is 263 units, but historical evidence confirms that orders from Period 2 (172 units) and Period 6 (79 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed, leaving only 12 units (from Period 12) as reliable pipeline inventory. The actual lead time has stabilized back to approximately 3 periods (Period 9 arrived in Period 12). Demand has consistently stabilized around 85 units per period over the last five concluded periods (P8-P12 avg: 85.0). Therefore, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the confirmed delivery time. For mu_hat, I used recent_N (N=5) to capture the stabilized mean of 85, which results in (1+L)*85 = 340. For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=5) is used to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged approximately 82 units per period (97, 53, 97, 84, 79). Although P10 was an outlier at 53, the overall trend remains stable in the low 80s range. Lead times remain highly volatile, with recent successful arrivals showing L=3, L=1, L=3, and L=2. The orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 251 units) are long overdue and confirmed as lost, meaning they should be excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Currently, 348 units are theoretically 'in-transit', but 251 are lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 97 units (likely the P12 and P13 orders). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (~82/period). With 0 on-hand inventory and a reduced functional pipeline, the OR engine needs to prioritize replenishing stock while accounting for lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at approximately 82 units/period (P9-P13 average); Functional pipeline is 97 units, as 251 units (P2, P6) remain confirmed lost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 348 units, but 251 units from P2 and P6 are still confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, making the functional pipeline only 97 units (likely the orders from P12 and P13). Historical demand has stabilized: the average over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approximately 83 units/period (97, 53, 97, 84, 79, 88). While lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, 3 periods remains the most conservative estimate for successful arrivals. I will use L=3 to ensure the backend calculates a base stock covering (3+1)=4 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to recent_N with N=6 captures the current stable demand regime (~83/unit). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will order the difference between the target base stock and the functional pipeline (97 units), helping to recover from the stockout caused by the lost shipments.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system shows 0 units on-hand and 348 units in-transit. However, 251 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed based on historical context, leaving a functional pipeline of only 97 units (85 ordered in P13 and 12 ordered in P15). Demand has stabilized around 82 units per period over the last 7 periods (P9-P15). I will set L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and mu_hat to cover the lead time plus one period (L+1=4) using a recent average of 82 units (4 * 82 = 328). Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline inventory (348) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target to account for the 251 units it incorrectly assumes are arriving (328 + 251 = 579). This ensures the order placed today compensates for the missing inventory. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, our on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently spiked to 132 in P16, whereas the previous 5-period average (P11-P15) was approximately 85. The 421 units in-transit includes orders from P2 (172) and P6 (79) which are confirmed as lost (251 units total). The functional pipeline consists of orders from P15 (12 units) and P16 (158 units), totaling 170 units. Lead times have mostly stabilized at 3 periods for successful deliveries. To prevent stockouts during this potential demand surge, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 and an explicit mu_hat based on the elevated demand of 120 units/period (reflecting the P16 spike) across (1+L)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen. This setting will signal the OR backend to place an order that covers the 480 unit target (4 * 120) minus the functional pipeline (170), while ignoring the 251 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand surge: Period 16 demand increased to 132 (+55% vs P11-P15 avg of 85). Functional pipeline is current in-transit minus 251 lost units (P2/P6 orders).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 132 units, repeating the high demand from Period 16 (also 132 units). This confirms a recent upward shift in demand compared to the Period 11-15 average of ~85 units. Lead times remain inconsistent, with recent arrivals occurring at 1 period (P16 order) and 3 periods (P13 order), though 3 periods remains the dominant reliable lead time. The pipeline inventory includes 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. To ensure the backend places orders that cover this updated demand regime while accounting for the 'dead' pipeline stock, I am setting L to 3 (most conservative reliable lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 528. This value represents (L+1) * 132, reflecting the current high-demand state. I continue to use a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: increased from ~85 to 132 (+55%) sustained for 2 periods; Functional pipeline still excludes 251 units from P2/P6.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, increasing from an average of ~85 to ~132. Although Period 18 demand was lower (81), the presence of stockouts (ending on-hand=0) likely suppresses the observed demand signal, and Period 16/17 showed a strong surge. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~115) while accounting for the recent volatility. The actual lead time has been highly variable, swinging between 1 and 3 periods (P16 arrived in 1, P13 in 3). I will use L=3 'explicit' to remain conservative given the stockout at the start of Period 19. Of the 544 units in-transit, 251 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 293 units (544-251). To compensate for the backend's ignorance of these lost units, I must inflate the L or mu_hat parameters. Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat to capture the recent regime shift (N=3) allows the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time, helping to recover the inventory position.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the demand context shows a confirmed upward shift since Period_16, with an average demand of approximately 112.5 units over the last four periods (132, 132, 81, 105). Although Period_18 dropped to 81, the overall movement is higher than the previous baseline of ~82-85. The pipeline inventory (544 units) includes 251 units from P2 and P6 that are historically confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 544 - 251 = 293 units. Lead times have been highly variable, switching between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to ensure sufficient coverage for the longer scenario. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the recent higher demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to address the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand from P16-P19 is ~113 units/period (+37% vs previous P11-P15 baseline). Functional pipeline remains (In-transit - 251 lost units).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P20) shows an average of 127 units per period, a significant increase from the previous baseline. The last observed demand (P20) was 186, suggesting either high volatility or a further upward spike. In-transit inventory stands at 544 units, but 251 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2 and P6), leaving a functional pipeline of 293 units. Lead times have been highly variable (1, 2, and 3 periods), though 3 periods remains the most frequent successful duration. I will set L to 3 to be conservative for safety stock calculation. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~127). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (demand range 81-186). Setting these parameters allows the OR backend to target a base stock roughly covering 4 periods (L+1) of this higher demand while accounting for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P16 (avg ~127 vs previous ~85); Recent demand at P20 (186) shows high variance or potential further shift.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 140.6 units over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), compared to the previous ~85 average. Period 20 and 21 saw very high demand (186 and 167), suggesting a sustained higher level. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory of 575 units includes 251 units from P2 and P6 that are historically confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the 'functional' pipeline is 324 units. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock for this new demand level, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average demand (~141) across a (1 + L) horizon. Although recent lead times have varied (1-3 periods), 3 is the conservative estimate. Thus, mu_hat = (1 + 3) * 141 = 564. I am using the 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the functional pipeline adjustment within the mu_hat calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at P21: avg demand P16-P21 is ~141 units/period (+65% vs P11-P15 baseline). Functional pipeline remains (In-transit - 251 lost units).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is approximately 131.8 units/period (132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120). I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the increased volatility (std dev ~35.5). Regarding lead time, we have observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with several shipments (P2 and P6) confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 629 units includes those 251 lost units (P2: 172, P6: 79), making the functional pipeline 378 units. Given the lead time variance and high recent demand (P20-P21 peaked at 186 and 167), I am maintaining L=3 (method: calculate or explicit) to ensure the backend targets a base stock that covers the 3nd-period arrival, which is the most common successful delivery time. Setting L=3 and N=7 allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock covering (1+3)=4 periods of demand at the new higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P22 average is ~132 units/period, a ~55% increase from the previous baseline. Sigma has also increased significantly due to recent high-demand peaks (P20=186, P21=167).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, with demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) averaging approximately 132 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~82. Recent volatility is high (peaks of 186, 167), requiring a higher sigma_hat to maintain service levels. Regarding inventory, 251 units (from Period 2 and Period 6 orders) remain lost/indefinitely delayed and must be excluded from functional pipeline calculations. The 'In-transit' of 544 units includes these 251 lost units, meaning the actual functional pipeline is only 293 units (544 - 251). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent successful lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods; I will continue to use the calculated average lead time. To capture the higher demand and increased variance of the current regime, I am using recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, with an average of approximately 130 units/period (P16-P24), compared to the previous ~85. Although Period 24 demand was slightly lower (112), the overall trend remains significantly higher than the pre-P16 period. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline inventory is 544 units, but this includes 251 units from orders placed in P2 and P6 which are confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed (overdue by 22 and 18 periods respectively). Thus, the 'functional' pipeline is 293 units (544 - 251). Lead times have been highly variable, recently showing 1, 2, and 3 periods, suggesting an average near the promised L=2. I will use recent_N=9 (capturing the shift from P16-P24) to set mu_hat at this new higher level (~130 units/period) and recent_N=9 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility from recent spikes. Given the stockout and the lost shipments, the 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting will help the OR engine place orders that account for the higher current consumption rate while ignoring the dead units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P24 stabilized at ~130 units/period (+53% vs P11-P15 baseline). Functional pipeline remains (In-transit total - 251 lost units).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level, with an average of approximately 130 units per period (P16-P25 average is 127.5). Recent demand in P25 was 147. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while the total in-transit is 544 units, 251 units (from Period 2 and 6) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed based on historical context. This leaves a functional pipeline of 293 units (544 - 251). The lead time remains highly variable, with recent successful deliveries taking between 1 and 3 periods, so L is set to 3 to be conservative. To ensure the base-stock level accounts for the recent demand surge and high variance (high of 186 in P20), I am using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the entire high-demand regime since P16.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P26) shows a sustained increase, with an average of approximately 131 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~85. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to stockouts, and the in-transit pipeline of 544 units includes 251 units from P2 and P6 that are realistically lost or indefinitely delayed. The functional pipeline is therefore 293 units (544 - 251). While lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, the OR backend's default promised lead time is 2. To account for the higher demand mean and variance since P16, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (P16-P26) to reflect the current regime while maintaining the lead time parameter at default (2) to align with promised expectations, relying on the functional inventory to cover the gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P26 remains stabilized at an average of ~131 units/period (+54% vs P11-P15 baseline). Functional pipeline inventory must exclude 251 confirmed lost units (P2 and P6 orders) from total in-transit to prevent stockouts.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is approximately 130.4 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the total in-transit is 544. However, as documented in carry-over insights, 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the 'functional' pipeline is 544 - 251 = 293 units. Given the lead time is approximately 3 periods (with high variance), the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. At ~131/period, we need ~524 units. With only 293 functional units in transit and 0 on hand, the OR backend needs to place a significant order to close the ~231 unit gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=12) to capture the higher demand regime and 'explicit' for L to ensure the OR engine targets a 3-period horizon.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P28) maintains an average of ~130 units/period, with P28 demand at 115. On-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 559 units, but 251 units from P2 and P6 are long-confirmed as lost. Thus, functional in-transit is 308 units (559 - 251). While lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, a 3-period lead time remains the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase. I will set mu_hat based on the last 13 periods (regime since P16) to capture the current mean of ~130, which for L=2 (3 periods coverage) equals ~390. I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the confirmed 3-period lead time observed in resilient shipments. For sigma_hat, recent_N=13 will capture the increased volatility of this regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 16. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is approximately 126 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~85. Although recent demand (P27-P29) has been slightly lower (89, 115, 76), the broader P16-P29 window remains the most relevant for capturing the current regime's volume and volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit is 559 units, but 251 units are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 6 orders), leaving a functional pipeline of 308 units. Lead times have been highly variable (1 to 3 periods), so I will use an explicit lead time of 3 periods to ensure the inventory target covers the possible upper bound. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of the last 14 samples (4 * 126.1). sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L) * std of the same period (sqrt(4) * 31.7).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at an average of roughly 128 units/period (P16-P30 mean = 127.8). Despite several periods with zero on-hand inventory causing stockouts, demand remains robust. A critical system issue persists where 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, meaning the current 'In-transit' of 544 units contains only 293 functional units (544 - 251). With 0 on-hand inventory at the start of Period 31, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) horizon. Lead times have been highly variable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods); I will use an explicit L=3 to be conservative and prevent further stockouts. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods (L+1) at the current regime average (128 units/period * 4 = 512). Sigma_hat is set to account for the high variance observed in this regime (notably the 186 and 167 peaks). Given the functional pipeline (293) is significantly below the target base stock, the OR backend will trigger a max-cap order to replenish.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a baseline of ~85 to an average of ~131 units/period. Over the most recent 10 periods (P22-P31), the mean demand is ~120 units/period, while the long-term regime average (P16-P31) is ~126. A recent cooling is observed (P27-P31 average is ~98), so I will use N=10 to balance the recent softening against the higher regime mean. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit stands at 563 units, but 251 units are confirmed lost (P2 and P6 orders), leaving a functional pipeline of 312 units. Lead times have been highly volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods); I will set L to 3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts during this high-variance period. The target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu) must realistically account for this functional pipeline to trigger appropriate ordering from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P31 average is ~126 units/period. Recent 5-period average (P27-P31) shows a softening to ~98 units/period. Functional pipeline inventory remains (In-transit total - 251 lost units).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime initiated at Period 16 remains the primary driver, though recent periods show a slight stabilization below the peak surge levels. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 32 is approximately 125 units. However, looking at the last 6 periods (P27-P32), the average is lower at ~96 units. Given the high stockout frequency (on-hand is 0), I will prioritize covering the higher sustained regime (N=17) for mu_hat to recover inventory position. Lead time continues to be highly variable (range 1 to 3 periods); I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current logistics performance. Crucially, 251 units from Period 2 (172) and Period 6 (79) are long-confirmed as lost. The OR backend must be compensated for these 'phantom' units in the pipeline (In-transit: 544 total - 251 lost = 293 functional) to prevent the policy from under-ordering. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat with its calculated (1+L) value based on the P16+ regime mean (~125) and L=2 to ensure the backend sees a target of ~375, and 'explicit' for L to stabilize expectations near the observed average.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units/period over the last 18 periods (P16-P33), though a slight softening is observed recently (last 7 periods average ~100). Given the high cost of stockouts (profit=4 vs holding=1), I will use the more conservative recent period average (N=18) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring sufficient base stock. The lead time (L) remains variable but averages 2.5 periods across all successful arrivals (excluding the 251 lost units from P2 and P6). Functional pipeline inventory is total in-transit (544) minus confirmed lost units (251) = 293 units. With current on-hand at 0, the OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=recent_N (N=10) provides a responsive lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean from P16-P33 is ~112 units/period, while P27-P33 suggests a local average of ~100 units/period. Functional pipeline inventory check: 251 units (P2/P6) are definitively lost/removed from active supply.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27-P34) shows a local stable mean of approximately 95 units/period, down from the peak seen in the P16-P26 period. I am using recent_N=8 to capture this current softened regime. Lead time remains highly variable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods for successful deliveries), but the mean observed lead time has settled around 2 periods. Critically, 251 units (from P2 and P6 orders) remain definitively lost. The current total in-transit is 544 units, but the 'functional' in-transit is 544 - 251 = 293 units. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and a functional pipeline of 293, and a target base stock for a (2+1) period window at ~95 units/period (total ~285 units), the supply is currently balanced with demand. I set L to 2 (promised/average) and use recent_N for mu and sigma to reflect the current softened demand level (approx 95/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean from P27-P34 has stabilized at ~95 units/period, a significant softening from the P16-P26 peak (~131 units/period). Functional pipeline calculation remains (In-transit total - 251 lost units).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the Period 16-26 peak. The local average demand from Period 27 to Period 35 is approximately 97 units per period. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 544 units, but historically, 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. This means the functional pipeline is 293 units (544 - 251). Despite this functional pipeline, On-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has consistently resulted in stockouts due to infrequent ordering. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with many recent orders arriving quickly (1-2 periods) or not at all. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable period since P27) to estimate demand (mu_hat) at ~97 units/period and lead time (L) at the promised 2 periods to ensure sufficient base stock is calculated by the OR engine. This will prompt an order to cover the gap between the functional pipeline and the required service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean from P27-P35 has stabilized at ~97 units/period, down from the P16-P26 average of ~131 units/period. Functional pipeline calculation must continue to subtract 251 units (P2/P6 orders) from total in-transit to reflect actual expected arrivals.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the Period 16-26 peak. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 36 is approximately 97 units per period. Lead times have shown significant variance (ranging from 1 to 3 periods for successful arrivals), but the promised lead time remains 2. Crucially, a total of 251 units (from orders in Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, making the 'In-transit' figure deceptive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 544. Adjusting for the 251 lost units, the functional pipeline is 293 units. With an average demand of ~97, a functional pipeline of 293 units covers roughly 3 periods of demand (matching L+1 where L is the promised lead time of 2). However, as on-hand is zero and recent periods have seen stockouts, maintaining this stock level is critical. I will set mu_hat based on the stable recent average of 97 units across the (L+1) window, and use recent_N for sigma to account for the ongoing volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new regime since Period 27, averaging approximately 100 units per period (P27-P37 average is 99.1). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this stability while smoothing recent variance (e.g., P37 demand of 132). Lead time remains erratic but averages around 2-3 periods for successful deliveries. A critical constraint is the pipeline inventory: the system shows 544 units in-transit, but 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. This leaves a 'functional' pipeline of 293 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently at Period 38 of 50, I need to ensure the backend recognizes that a significant portion of the 'In-transit' visible to it will never arrive. Although I cannot directly edit the in-transit value, setting L to 2 (promised) and using a 11-period demand window for mu_hat and sigma_hat should allow the base stock calculation to stabilize. Based on the functional pipeline (293) vs expected demand over L+1 (300), current coverage is nearly sufficient, but the persistent at-zero on-hand inventory suggests the OR backend is being misled by the ghost units in-transit.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 97 units/period since Period 27 (P27-P38 average is approx 99). Recent demand in P37 (132) and P38 (98) confirms this baseline with some volatility. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and current in-transit is reported as 544. However, historical evidence from Carry-over Insights confirms that 251 units (from P2 and P6 orders) are permanently lost or indefinitely delayed. Thus, the 'functional pipeline' is 293 units (544 - 251). Given the current period is 39 out of 50, and lead times typically fluctuate between 1-3 periods, a base stock strategy covering (L+1) periods (approx 4 periods) is required. With mu_hat around 100 and L=3, the target base stock is ~400 units. Since functional pipeline (293) + current on-hand (0) = 293, the OR backend needs to order to reach that target. I will use recent_N (N=12, covering P27-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-surge stabilized demand levels (~99 units/period) while maintaining the promised lead time L=2 for the OR engine, knowing it tends to fluctuate up to 3.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units/period over the most recent 13 periods (P27-P39 average: 100). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 544 units. However, 251 units from P2 and P6 are confirmed as indefinitely lost/delayed. Furthermore, recent periods P33-P39 show no arrivals, meaning the orders from P28 and P31 successfully arrived but subsequent pipeline replenishments haven't happened because no orders were placed between P32 and P39. We are currently in a stockout state. To recover, I'll set mu_hat based on the recent 13-period stable regime (N=13) and use an explicit lead time of 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals occurred within 1-2 periods. The OR backend will see 544 in-transit, so identifying and compensating for the 251 lost units is normally handled by 'explicit' methods, but since the cap logic uses pipeline inventory, and I want to force an order to end the stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean from P27-P39 has stabilized at ~100 units/period. Significant stockout duration (P33-P40) due to no orders being placed and pipeline depletion.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has been in a prolonged stockout since Period 33 because No orders were placed following Period 32. Demand from Period 27 to Period 40 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 97 units per period. The in-transit inventory of 544 units includes 251 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (as established in carry-over insights). Therefore, the 'functional' in-transit inventory is 544 - 251 = 293 units. However, looking at the history, the last placed order was an order of 19 units in Period 31 (which arrived) and no orders were recorded between Period 32 and Period 40. This suggests the 544 units in-transit might reflect very recent automated/background orders or a data discrepancy, but I must base the parameters on the underlying demand and lead time. Actual lead times have been volatile (1-3 periods). I will set L to 2 (promised) to average out the 1-3 range, and mu_hat using recent_N=14 (P27-P40) to capture the current stable demand regime (~97 units/period).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is emerging from a significant stockout period (P33-P41) where no orders were placed, leading to zero on-hand inventory. Demand from P27 to P41 has averaged approximately 99 units/period, showing a stabilized regime lower than the P16-P26 peak. The current in-transit inventory is 544 units, however, 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 orders are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, leaving a functional pipeline of 293 units. Lead times have shown high variance, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2-3 periods. To recover from the stockout while acknowledging the functional pipeline and stabilized demand, I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat (demand for L+1 periods) based on the recent 15-period average (~100/period * 3 = 300), and a moderate sigma_hat to account for recent high demand spikes (e.g., P41 demand of 147). The OR backend will subtract the functional pipeline from the calculated base stock to determine if additional units are needed.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a persistent stockout since Period 33, primarily due to zero orders being placed between Periods 33 and 42 and the depletion of earlier pipeline inventory. While the total in-transit is reported as 544 units, 251 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed based on historical evidence. Thus, the 'functional' in-transit is 293 units. Recent demand (P41: 147, P42: 160) suggests a significant upward shift, possibly seasonal or a new regime, diverging from the previous P27-P39 average of ~100. Over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), the average demand is ~115 units. To recover from the stockout and address the recent demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent volatility and setting L to an explicit value of 3 to account for historical lead-time instability (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods) ensuring the OR backend targets a safer base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period_41: recent demand (P41-P42) averaged 153.5 units (+53.5% vs P27-P39 mean of 100). Functional pipeline inventory is (Total In-transit - 251 lost units).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P41-P43) has shifted to a significantly higher regime, averaging 149.3 units per period, compared to the P27-P39 average of approximately 100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is empty of functional stock (the 544 in-transit units include 251 units confirmed lost from P2 and P6, and the rest were just ordered or are significantly delayed). To recover from the prolonged stockout and meet this new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this recent surge. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. I'll stick with the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline, as recent successful deliveries (when they happen) have varied between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at P41: average increased to ~149 (P41-P43) from the previous ~100 (P27-P39). Observed lead times are highly variable (1-3 periods), but 251 units (from P2 and P6) remain permanently lost.

The functional pipeline inventory is 293 units (Total In-transit 544 - 251 lost units). Lead times have been anywhere from 1 to 3 periods; I will use a lead time of 2 for calculations (L=2). To satisfy demand over the review + lead time (1+2=3 periods), we need to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 3 * 142 = 426 units. Setting L to 'explicit' at 2, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (P41-P44), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: average increased from ~100 to ~142 (+42%). Functional pipeline inventory remains (Total In-transit - 251 lost units).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41, with an average of approximately 138 units over the last 5 periods (147, 160, 141, 118, 124), significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100. Despite this high demand, no orders have been placed in the last several periods (P28 to P45, except for very small ones early on), leading to a prolonged stockout and zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' of 544 units likely consists of very old, lost orders from early in the game (specifically the identified 251 lost units from P2/P6) and potential orders from periods where data might be missing or older pipeline units. However, based on the history, no new inventory has arrived since P32. To recover from this massive stockout during the recent high-demand rally (avg 138), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the expected demand for the remaining periods, accounting for the 2-period promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current high-demand state (~138/period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect high volatility. I am choosing L=default (2) because recent successful arrivals (when they occurred) fluctuated between 1-3, and the system is in desperate need of a replenishment trigger.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: average increased to ~138 (P41-P45) from the previous ~100. Prolonged stockout active; pipeline inventory of 544 units remains unreliable due to 251 confirmed lost units and no arrivals since P32.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 41, with an average of approximately 134 units/period over the last 6 periods (P41-P46: 147, 160, 141, 118, 124, 113). Despite a prolonged stockout and no recent orders, the inventory pipeline shows 544 units 'in-transit'. However, as established in the carry-over insights, 251 units from Period 2 and Period 6 orders are permanently lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 293 units (544 - 251). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the game is approaching its conclusion (P47 of 50), the priority is to ensure the pipeline covers the remaining periods. With a promised lead time of 2 and an actual observed lead time ranging from 1 to 3 periods, I calculate mu_hat using the recent 6-period regime (N=6) to reflect the current higher demand level (~134/period) across the lead time + review period. Sigma_hat is also set to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will use these to determine if the 293 functional in-transit units are sufficient to meet demand through the remaining periods or if a new order is required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a prolonged stockout since Period 32 due to zero orders being placed since then, combined with 251 units (P2/P6) confirmed as lost. Current In-transit is 544. Filtering out the 251 lost units, the functional pipeline is 293 units. However, no arrivals have occurred in 15 periods (since P32), despite orders being placed earlier (P17, P18). Current demand from P41-P47 averages approximately 122 units per period, although P47 showed a sudden dip to 53. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime that started at P41, tempered by the recent dip. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the high-end of observed successful arrivals and protect against lead time variance during this replenishment phase. The goal is to trigger the backend to order enough to break the stockout given the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand from P41-P47 averages 122 units/period, showing a higher regime than the P27-P39 baseline (~100). Pipeline integrity remains compromised: 251 units (P2, P6) are lost, and no shipments have arrived since Period 32, indicating extreme delay or loss for orders placed in P17 (97 units) and P18 (184 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The current situation is critical due to a prolonged stockout and significant pipeline unreliability. Total in-transit is 548 units, but 251 units (from P2 and P6) have been confirmed lost for over 30 periods. Furthermore, orders from P17 (97 units) and P18 (184 units) are now 31-32 periods overdue with no arrivals since Period 32, strongly suggesting they are also lost. This leaves a 'functional' pipeline of almost zero (548 - 251 - 97 - 184 = 16 units). Demand from P41-P48 has buffered between high spikes and low troughs, averaging ~115 units/period. The OR backend needs to place a massive restorative order. I will set L to 3 (the most common successful lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the demand regime (~120 per period) over the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is set high to account for recent high variance. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is necessary here because the backend's default calculation would include the zero-demand periods from the stockout/history which would underestimate the current needs, and 'recent_N' might still be diluted by the recent low demand of P47-P48.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity failure: Orders from P17 (97 units) and P18 (184 units) are now confirmed lost along with P2/P6, bringing total lost units in 'In-transit' to 532 units out of 548.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has experienced extreme delivery failures. In-transit inventory is 548 units, but 532 of those are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, and P18 orders). Only 16 units in the pipeline are potentially viable. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand from P41-P49 has averaged ~113 units/period, but recent demand (P47-P49) has softened to ~70 units/period. The current period is 50, which is the final period of the game. Since the simulation ends this period, any order placed now will not arrive in time to be sold (minimum lead time is 1, and the game ends after Period 50 demand resolution). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a minimal value (or 0) to avoid placing unnecessary orders that would only incur cost without potential revenue.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity failure finalized: 532 units (P2, P6, P17, P18) of 548 total in-transit are confirmed lost. Final period of simulation reached.
