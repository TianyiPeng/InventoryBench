However, if the 150 units from P2 are lost (not arrived yet), inventory will drop quickly. I will place a moderate order to account for the risk of the P2 order being lost while avoiding excessive holding costs. Projected end of P5 inventory (before arrivals) = 286 - 177 = 109.

(c) Lead time analysis: Promised is 2. P1 order arrived P4 (LT=3). P3 order arrived P4 (LT=1).

Total units in-transit (410) consists of P2 (150 - presumed lost), P6 (180), P9 (80). Order from P6 (lead_time 3) should arrive in P9 conclude (P10 start) or P10 conclude (P11 start).

Total Pipeline (On-hand 43 + In-transit 370) = 413 units. While 413 technically covers the 400-unit target, the high loss rate (2 out of 10 orders so far) necessitates a buffer.

I am now classifying these additional 300 units as lost. This brings 'Total Stagnant/Lost' to 750 units. The effective pipeline is therefore only 100 units (P24: 50, P25: 50), which allows for the P23 order having already arrived (confirmed in P25 conclude). Current on-hand is 310. Using an (L+1) window (3+1=4 periods) for inventory coverage at 100 units/period, I need a target inventory of 400 plus safety stock. Total effective inventory (On-hand 310 + Valid In-transit 100) is 410. To maintain a safety buffer against the high loss rate (~50% recent loss rate based on P17-P19), I will order 100 units.",
