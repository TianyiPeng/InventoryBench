The mean is approximately 118 units. The spike in Period 5 (177) suggests potential volatility or a local event. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period of decision-making, I have no historical arrival data to recalculate actual lead time. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. With a lead time of 2, an order placed in Period 1 will arrive in Period 3 (L+1 = 3). e) Final Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is ~118. Total required for 3 periods is approx 354 units. Given the recent spike to 177, I will lean slightly higher to ensure service levels are maintained while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Harris (chips(Regular)) sells for $19.0 per unit with a holding cost of $1.0 per unit. We are currently at Period 38 out of 50.

**1. Demand Analysis:**
- Historical demand shows a baseline of ~100 units, followed by a spike (P20-P23) and subsequent stabilization.
- Recent demand (P31-P37): 103, 111, 86, 86, 104, 89, 132.
- The average demand over the last 7 periods is approx. 102 units.
- Service level should be high given the high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1).

**2. Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis:**
- **Promised Lead Time:** 2 periods.
- **Actual Lead Time Performance:** Extremely variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high incidence of lost orders (approx. 50% loss rate historically).
- **Reported In-transit:** 1456 units.
- **Lost Orders (Cumulative):** As of P37, CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS confirm 1196 units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30).
- **Functional Pipeline:** 1456 (reported) - 1196 (confirmed lost) = 260 units. 
- The functional pipeline consists of orders from P33 (130 units, now 5 periods old - likely lost) and P37 (130 units).
- **Update on P33:** The order from P33 (130 units) is now 5 periods old. Given the threshold established in insights (orders > 3-4 periods are lost), P33 is now considered lost.
- **Revised Functional Pipeline:** 130 units (from P37 only).

**3. Inventory Position:**
- **On-hand:** 176 units.
- **Real Pipeline:** 130 units (P37 order).
- **Total Position:** 306 units.
- **Coverage Goal:** With a variable lead time of up to 3 periods, and the current period (P38) demand still to resolve, we need to cover at least P38, P39, P40, and P41 to be safe against the 3-period max lead time. 
- **Requirement:** 4 periods * 110 units/period = 440 units.
- **Gap:** 440 - 306 = 134 units.

**4. Order Logic:**
I will order 130 units to maintain the current logic of replacing expected demand and accounting for the high probability of shipment failure. Since we have a decent on-hand buffer (176), we can afford to stay consistent without over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs, while still hedging against the frequent order losses.

Based on carry-over insights, there is a cumulative 1326 units of lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33) reported in 'In-transit'. To find the functional pipeline: Reported In-transit (1586) - Confirmed Lost (1326) = 260 units. These 260 units represent the orders from Period 37 (130) and Period 39 (130). The Period 37 order is now at T+3 and is at risk of being lost but is currently still treated as valid pipeline. Current on-hand is 106. Total functional inventory (On-hand + Pipeline) = 106 + 260 = 366 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~110 units/period (total 330 units) plus a small safety buffer for lost order risk, the existing functional inventory (366) is sufficient. However, to maintain a consistent replenishment flow and hedge against the high order loss rate, I will place a standard replenishment order for the expected demand.",
