Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), with a mean of 118 and a standard deviation of 36.9. Since we are in Period 1 and have no prior 'conclude' messages to verify actual lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2). For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all 5 historical samples to calculate the mean and standard deviation across the (L+1) horizon. This provides a statistically grounded starting point for the OR backend to set the base stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Demand in Period 1 was 106, which is aligned with the provided historical samples (avg ~100-110). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1, which is expected since we started with 0 inventory and a lead time > 0. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to account for the current demand levels, setting N=5 based on the provided historical demand points (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and the P1 observation (106). This helps the OR backend establish a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Our promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (180 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. The order placed in Period 2 (177 units) is expected in Period 4. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 357 units in-transit. Demand for the last two periods was 106 and 111, which is slightly lower than the provided pre-game samples (Avg ~118). Since we have no finalized arrivals yet, we continue to rely on the promised lead time (L=2). To manage the forecast, I will use recent_N with N=5 (including pre-game samples) to capture the trend while stabilizing for the target review period (1+L=3).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the order placed in Period 1 (180 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible at the start of Period 5. This is consistent with the rules. The Period 1-3 total demand was 324 units (106+111+107), which resulted in lost sales because on-hand was zero. Current historical demand samples provided (Period 1-5: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest a mean of roughly 118. However, the game history shows slightly different observations (106, 111, 107). I will use the recent 3 periods of game history to estimate demand. mu_hat should cover (L+1)=3 periods. Mean of (106, 111, 107) is 108. 108 * 3 = 324. Standard deviation of these three is small (approx 2.5), but to be safe against the sample of 177 in Period 5, I will use recent_N with N=3 for variability but maintain a slightly higher explicit sigma or recent_N to handle the stochastic nature.

Daily Profit: $2622.00, Daily Holding Cost: $143.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2479.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the state after Period 4's conclusion. Demand has been relatively consistent over the last 4 periods (106, 111, 107, 138), with an average around 115.5. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals show high variance: P1 arrived in 3 periods (late), and P3 arrived in 1 period (early). P2 (ordered 177 units) is still in-transit and overdue based on L=2 (it should have arrived in P4). We currently have 143 units on-hand and 177 in-transit. Given the lead time instability, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (which is (3+1)/2 = 2). For demand (mu_hat), recent_N with N=4 captures the slight upward trend in demand more effectively than the full history. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=4 to reflect the actual volatility seen in the sales data.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 40 units with 318 units in-transit. Historical demand over 5 periods is 106, 111, 107, 138, and 103 (Mean = 113). The lead time has shown variance: the P1 order arrived in 3 periods (greater than the promised 2), while the P3 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting a volatile actual lead time. To ensure we cover demand during the leads, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (N=5) are representative of the current regime. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to account for the recent demand volatility (high of 138, low of 103).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 455 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 6 periods averages 101.17, while the seed data for periods 1-5 averaged 118. Demand appears relatively stable in the 100-110 range, though Period 6 saw a dip (42) that was capped by stockout. Lead time is volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P2 is still missing (ordered P2, should have arrived P4 or P5 given L=2), and P3 took 1 period. This suggests the promised L=2 is a decent average but unreliable. Total pipeline (455) covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current demand regime and default lead time calculation to account for the variability between 1 and 3 periods observed.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (80, 120, 120, 93, 177, 106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42, 83) shows a mean around 107. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 509 units in-transit. Looking at lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period. P2 (ordered 177), P5 (ordered 141), P6 (ordered 137), and P7 (ordered 54) are currently in-transit. P2 is now 6 periods old, P5 is 3 periods old, P6 is 2 periods old. The absence of P2 (promised 2, now at 6) strongly suggests a lost shipment. P5 should have arrived by Period 7 but hasn't, suggesting a drift in lead time or another loss. I will set L=3 to account for the observed late delivery (P1) and current delays. Demand appears relatively stable despite the recent dip in P6, so I will use a window of the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current mean (~94) while acknowledging volatility. The goal is to trigger an order to bridge the gap if the backend perceives the pipeline as 'lost' or insufficient given the lead time shift.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory is 101 units with 314 units in transit. Historical demand suggests an average of roughly 100-110 units per period. Lead time analysis shows a split pattern: orders from P1 and P5 arrived in 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P7 arrived in 1 period (averaging the promised 2 periods). Order P2 (177 units) and P6 (137 units) are currently missing/overdue based on the 1-3 period observation. Since P2 was ordered in P2 and it is now P9, that order is likely lost. P6 was ordered in P6, so if lead time is 3, it should arrive in P9 (visible in P10). Total in-transit (314) matches P2 (177) + P6 (137). If P2 is lost, effective pipeline is only 137. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the variance in delivery times. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean which appears stable around 100. This ensures the base stock covers the mean demand over the risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the high lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average 2). Order from Period 2 (177 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1839.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is critically low at 4 units. I have 382 units in transit, but the arrival pattern for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile. Based on history, orders placed in odd-numbered periods (P1, P3, P5, P7) arrive in pairs (one with lead_time=3, one with lead_time=1), while orders placed in even-numbered periods have either been lost (P2) or haven't arrived yet (P6, P8). Specifically, the P5 and P7 orders arrived in P8. The P6 and P8 orders are currently in-transit. If the pattern holds, P6 (ordered with L=3) and P8 (ordered with L=1) should have arrived during P9, meaning they will be visible in the P10 conclude message. However, the order from P2 (ordered 8 periods ago) is almost certainly lost. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~104 units over the last 5 periods (P5-P9: 103, 42, 83, 94, 97). I will set L to 3 to account for the longer side of the lead-time oscillations and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand mean of ~104. Since (1+L) = 4, mu_hat should be ~416. sigma_hat will be set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the volatility of the most recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time follows a 'paired arrival' pattern: odd-period orders take 1 or 3 periods; even-period orders (P6, P8) likely arrive together every 2 periods or are at high risk of loss (P2 confirmed lost).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 11, on-hand 0, in-transit 412 units. Demand has stabilized but shows some variance (mean ~90-100 recently). Lead-time analysis: Period 2 order (177 units) is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). The observed lead-time pattern alternates between 1 and 3 periods for odd-numbered orders (P1=3, P3=1; P5=3, P7=1), while even-numbered orders (P6, P8, P10) have not yet arrived. If the pattern holds, the P9 order should arrive in Period 10 conclude (visible in P11, but it didn't) or Period 12 conclude. Specifically, P6 and P8 should have arrived by now if lead time was 3. This suggests even-period orders are either delayed further or potentially lost like P2. However, I must maintain an adequate base stock to cover (L+1) periods. Since the promised lead time is 2 but variance is high (1-3), I will use L=2 (default) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the current demand regime (~93 mean). Because in-transit includes 177 units that are definitely lost, the OR's 'pipeline_inventory' view is inflated. To compensate and trigger an order, I will set mu_hat explicitly to a value that exceeds (current pipeline - lost units) + next 3 periods of expected demand. Current pipeline (412) - lost (177) = 235 actual units. With demand ~100/period, I need a base stock around 300.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Order from Period 2 (177 units) is lost. Lead time for odd-numbered periods is alternating 1 and 3; even-numbered periods (P2, P6, P8) show high failure/loss rates.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 531 units. Based on history, orders from even-numbered periods (P2, P6, P8) have a high failure rate: P2 (177 units) is confirmed lost, while P6 (137 units) and P8 (0 units ordered) have not arrived. P10 (30 units) is still within a reasonable window if lead time is 3. Conversely, odd-numbered periods (P1, P3, P5, P7) arrive in a paired pattern with lead times of 3 and 1 respectively. Orders from P9 (68 units) and P11 (119 units) are expected to arrive in Period 12 resolution, which will be visible in P13. Given the Stock Out (Ending inventory 0 at P11), we must maintain a high base stock to recover. Demand has recently averaged ~82 units over the last 3 periods (P9-P11: 97, 53, 97). I will set L to 2 (promised) as the average of the 1 and 3 cycle is 2. For demand, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean which reflects a slight softening from the early periods, but enough to ensure the OR backend covers the replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Even-period orders (P2, P6) are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2 lost, P6 elapsed 6 periods). Odd-period orders arrive in pairs (L=3 for the first, L=1 for the second).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observed arrivals from Period 9 (L=3) and Period 10 (L=2). This breaks the previous pattern where even-period orders were lost. However, the order from Period 6 (ordered 7 periods ago) and Period 8 (ordered 5 periods ago) are still missing and highly likely lost based on historical behavior (P2 was lost). Currently, on-hand is low (14) and pipeline contains P11 (119 units) and any order placed now. The demand mean across the last 5 periods is approx 83 units. Since we are in an odd period (P13), based on history (P1, P5, P9), the lead time for this order is likely to be 3 periods. I will set L=3. To ensure we cover demand during this wait, I'll set mu_hat to (1+3)*83 = 332. History shows P11 (even if it arrives in P13) and P12 (if any, though arrived=0 shows no order P12) are unreliable. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand regime which is slightly lower than the initial samples.

Carry-over insight: Even-period orders are not guaranteed lost: Period 10 arrived with L=2 in Period 12. However, P6 and P8 remain missing (L>5) and are likely lost. Odd-period orders continue to show L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout. Historical data reveals a complex lead-time pattern. Odd-numbered orders (P1, P3, P5, P7, P9) arrive in pairs: one with L=3 and one with L=1 (e.g., P5 and P7 both arrived during P8). Even-numbered orders are highly unreliable: P2, P6, and P8 are presumed lost (elapsed periods 12, 8, and 6 respectively), while P10 arrived with L=2. P11 (odd) is expected to arrive in P14 (L=3), and P12 (even) is a high-risk order. The pipeline of 433 units includes P11 (119 units), P12 (0), and subsequent placeholders which are largely ghost inventory if losses persist. Because the current lead-time behavior for odd-period orders averages to L=2 but is volatile, and even-period orders are frequently lost, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the 'late' half of the paired arrivals. Demand remains stable, with the most recent 13 samples averaging approximately 93 units. Using N=13 for mu_hat ensures the forecast reflects this stability despite recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Even-period order reliability is low: P2, P6, and P8 confirmed or likely lost (L>6). Odd-period orders arrive in pairs: the first with L=3 and the second with L=1.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 31. Demand is stable, averaging 89 over the last 5 periods and 91 overall. The critical issue is the lead-time pattern and missing shipments. In-transit inventory (331) includes orders from P6 (137, L=9), P8 (0, L=7), P10 (arrived), P12 (0), and P14 (17). History confirms even-period orders P2, P6, and P8 are lost. Odd-period orders consistently arrive with alternating lead times (P9/L=3, P10/L=2, P11/L=3). Following the pattern, P13 and P15 should arrive in pairs in Period 16 (L=3 for P13, L=1 for P15). I set L=1 to reflect this pattern of arrival in the very next resolution phase. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L=2) periods of demand based on the recent average (~180 total), and sigma_hat is kept at a default level as demand volatility is moderate.

Carry-over insight: Even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) are confirmed lost after 7+ periods. Odd-period orders follow a pattern where the (N)th order takes L=3 and the (N+2)th order takes L=1, resulting in paired arrivals in even-numbered periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we enter with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical patterns confirm a dichotomy in lead times: even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) represent lost shipments, while odd-period orders arrive in pairs. Specifically, the P11 order (arrived P14) followed this pattern, and we are currently waiting for the P14/P15/P16 cycle. The P13 order is expected to arrive in Period 16 (L=3), and the P15 order should arrive in Period 16 (L=1). However, since we cannot observe P16 arrivals yet, we must ensure our parameters for Period 16 account for the current stockout and the high probability that orders placed on even periods (like P16) may fail entirely. To protect against the unreliability of even-period orders and the 3-period cycle of odd orders, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the longest successful lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering P11-P15) to capture the current demand average of approx 85 units per period. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This conservative lead time and recent demand window will help the OR backend calculate a base stock sufficient to bridge the gaps caused by lost even-period shipments.

Carry-over insight: Even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) are confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed). Sustained lead-time pattern: odd-period orders arrive with L=3 or L=1, usually in pairs on even-numbered periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17. Looking at the history, demand has transitioned from an average of ~110 in the first 5 periods to a lower average of ~90 between Periods 6-15, but Period 16 showed a spike to 132. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend while stabilizing for the recent spike. Lead time analysis confirms a severe reliability issue: orders placed on even-numbered periods (P2, P6, P8) are lost. This explains why 'In-transit' is 367 (P14: 17, P16: 36, plus likely lost units from P2, P6, P8). Orders placed on odd periods consistently arrive in pairs: P9(L=3) + P10(L=2) arrived in P12, while P11(L=3) arrived in P14. P13 was a 'skipped' order (0 units). P15 was also 0 units ordered. This means only P14 and P16 are truly in-transit. Since we are in an odd period (P17), and following the L=3/L=1 pattern observed (P1, P5, P9, P11 all arrived with L=3), I expect the order placed today (P17) to arrive in P20 (L=3). I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended delay and the loss of even-period stocks, targeting a inventory level that covers 4 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1007.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent surge (last two periods were 132 units each, significantly higher than the previous average of approx. 90-100). The lead-time pattern is highly irregular: even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) appear systematically lost, and odd-period orders typically arrive in pairs (L=3 for the first, L=1 for the second). Currently, P17 (ordered 72) is in-transit. I expect P17 to arrive in Period 18 (L=1, matching the P14/P16 pair pattern) or Period 20. However, the system shows 386 units in transit. Subtracting the known lost shipments (P2=177, P6=137), the active pipeline is likely P8 (72 units - possibly lost but not confirmed), P17 (72), and P18 (current order). Because even-period orders are consistently lost, I will set a very low order for Period 18 to avoid wasting capital and inflating the pipeline with 'phantom' inventory that never arrives. Demand is modeled on a 'recent_N' of 4 to capture the recent spike (mean ~113.5). L is set to explicit '1' to account for the expected arrival of the odd-period sequence in the next resolution phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand increased from ~90 to ~132 (+46%). Even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) continue to be highly unreliable/lost, causing intermittent stockouts.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. Based on the history, demand shifted significantly around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~90 units to ~132 units, though the most recent sample (Period 18) was lower at 81. I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this higher-regime variance while acknowledging the recent dip. The lead-time pattern is the primary challenge: even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) were consistently lost or failed to arrive, while odd-period orders arrive in pairs in even-numbered periods (e.g., P1+P3 arrived P4, P5+P7 arrived P8, P9+P10 arrived P12, P14+P16 arrived P17). Period 19 is an odd period. According to the pattern, an order placed now is likely to arrive in Period 22 (L=3), paired with a future Period 21 order (L=1). Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing stockouts due to the unreliable even-period ordering, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer leg of the arrival cycle (L+1 = 4 periods of demand coverage). This helps protect against the 'lost order' risk associated with even periods and the 3-period delay for odd-period shipments.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory and 550 units in-transit. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm two major patterns: 1) A clear unreliability of even-period orders (P2, P6, P8 confirmed lost) while odd-period orders eventually arrive, often in pairs via L=3 and L=1 cycles. 2) A demand regime shift since Period 16, where mean demand has increased to approximately 112 units (average of P16-P19: 132, 132, 81, 105). Period 20 is an even period, meaning an order placed now is historically likely to be lost or severely delayed. However, we must maintain a base stock to cover demand across the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (so L+1=3). Given the recent demand shift, I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 4 periods to capture the higher mean and variance. The pipeline (550) is large due to an aggressive order in P19 (164 units), but with 0 on-hand and high stockout risk, we maintain the default L=2 to allow the OR backend to recalculate the necessary gap coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from P16-P19 is ~112 units, up from ~90. Even-period ordering remains a high-risk strategy due to historical losses (P2, P6, P8).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 21. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 16, with the most recent sample at 186 units highlighting significant volatility and potential upward trend. Looking at history, even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) were consistently lost, while odd-period orders follow an alternating lead time pattern (L=3 for the first of the pair, L=1 for the second), typically arriving in even periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 550 units in transit (likely including P17 and P19 orders). P17 (ordered 72) was placed in an odd period and is expected to arrive in P20 or P22 (L=3 or L=5 historically). P19 (ordered 164) is expected in P22 (L=3) or P20 (L=1). Because we are currently stocked out and the demand mean has increased to ~128 over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3, as this reflects the longer side of the successful alternating lead time cycles and accounts for the high risk of stockouts during these gaps. This ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from P16-P20 increased to ~128 units (+40% vs early periods). Lead time for odd-period orders remains variable between 1 and 3, but is the only reliable source of inventory as even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) were lost.

We are currently in a high-demand regime (P16-P21 mean demand ~133.8 units) compared to the early-game average (~90 units). We are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead-time pattern is highly irregular: odd-period orders (like P19 and P21) are the most reliable, typically arriving in pairs with L=3 and L=1 respectively, making P22 a likely arrival point for the P19 order. Even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) have been lost historically, though P10, P14, and P16 did arrive. Given the current stockout and high demand, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the +48% demand surge. The high in-transit amount (638 units) includes the P19 (164 units) and P21 (88 units) orders; the OR backend will subtract these from the target base stock. By using recent_N (N=6), we ensure the target reflects the new demand level while acknowledging the pipeline risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Mean demand increased from ~90 to ~133.8 (+48%). Even-period orders remain high-risk (P2, P6, P8 lost), while odd-period orders follow a 1-3 period lead-time alternation/pairing pattern.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with mean demand increasing from ~93 to ~133 (+43%). Recent demand (P16-P22) has been 132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120, averaging 131.86. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and increased volatility. On lead times: we are in a stockout (on-hand: 0) because even-period orders (P6, P8, P10, P12, P18, P20, P22) have historically been unreliable or lost, whereas odd-period orders (P1, P3, P5, P7, P9, P11, P14, P16, P17, P19, P21) are the primary inventory source. Currently, P19 (164 units) and P21 (88 units) are in-transit. Based on the 1-3 period alternation for odd orders, P19 (ordered P19, L=3?) should arrive in Period 22 or 23. Since it wasn't in the P22 conclude, I expect it and potentially P21 soon. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 1s and 3s, and use the recent 7 periods for demand estimation to ensure the base stock covers the current higher-demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~93 to ~132 (+42%) with higher volatility. Even-period orders remain high-risk/unreliable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 16, with a current mean of approximately 132 units per period (compared to ~100 previously). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced consistent stockouts. Historical analysis shows even-period orders (P2, P6, P8) were frequently lost, making our supply chain highly dependent on odd-period ordering or specific arrival windows. Currently, 557 units are in transit (P17, P19, P21, P23), including significant orders from P17 and P19 which are now overdue (L>3). If P17 and P19 are lost, the supply gap is severe. For Period 24 (an even period), based on the 'Even-period risk' pattern identified in carry-over insights, orders placed today are statistically likely to be lost or delayed. However, because we are at zero stock and facing a higher demand regime, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 3 to reflect the maximum observed reliable lead time and a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=8) to capture the post-P16 surge (P16-P23 avg \u2248 128). This forces the base stock calculation to account for higher demand and longer arrival times, though the actual order will be capped by the backend to prevent over-ordering into a potential loss-hole.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with mean demand increasing from ~93 to approximately 130 units. Recent periods (P16-P24) show high volatility (std dev ~30). The inventory situation is currently critical (on-hand: 0) due to lead-time instability and several historical lost orders (P2, P6, P8 confirmed lost). Following the observed pattern for odd-period orders (P21 arrived with L=2, P23/P25 are odd), I expect arrivals in pairs. There are 637 units in-transit (P19=164, P21=88, P23=7, P24=80, and others). Specifically, P19 (ordered 164) is now overdue (L=6) and P21 (ordered 88) arrived in P23. I will use a recent_N window (N=9, covering the Period 16 shift) to capture the higher demand mean (~131) and volatility. I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the frequent 3-period lead times observed for odd-numbered order placements, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next (L+1)=4 periods of this higher demand regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with mean demand increasing from approximately 90 to 132 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times are highly variable: the last two arrivals (ordered P21 and P23) arrived with a 2-period lead time, but historical data shows a pattern of alternating 1 and 3 periods for odd-numbered orders and frequent losses for even-numbered orders. Specifically, orders P2, P6, and P8 are confirmed lost. Currently, orders from P19 (164 units), P24 (80 units), and P26 (pending) are in-transit; P19 is severely delayed (L=7) and likely lost. To ensure availability given the 132-unit mean and high stockout risk, I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat specifically to cover the 132-unit demand over 3 periods (L+1), and recent_N for sigma to capture the increased volatility since Period 16 (N=10).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P25 remains stable at ~132 units/period. The order from Period 19 (164 units) is now likely lost (7 periods elapsed), matching the loss pattern previously seen in P2, P6, and P8.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with mean demand increasing from approximately 93 to 132 units. Since Period 16, the average demand is ~132.8 units (N=11). However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from Periods 2, 6, 8, and now 19 (164 units, 7 periods elapsed) are confirmed or likely lost. Current On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 630, but much of that pipeline is composed of potentially lost orders (specifically P19). The lead-time continues to fluctuate significantly, often resulting in stockouts. Given we have 0 on-hand and recent arrivals (P21, P23) had L=2, I will set L to 2 but maintain a high mu_hat based on the recent elevated demand regime (N=11) to account for the (L+1) period coverage. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Order from Period 19 (164 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed), matching the pattern of lost orders in P2, P6, and P8. This reinforces the high unreliability of the supply chain.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained stockout period (P26-P27) due to highly unreliable supply. Historical patterns show that orders placed in Period 2 (L=26+), Period 6 (L=22+), Period 8 (L=20+), and now Period 19 (L=8+) are likely lost. The supply chain consistently fails on specific orders, particularly those placed in even periods or periods following large jumps. Demand transitioned to a higher regime (~132 units/period) starting at P16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. With 630 units in-transit (from orders at P21, P23, P24, etc.), but with P19 likely lost, the pipeline is suspect. Since the promised lead time is 2, and the actual lead time shifts between 1 and 3 (with high loss rates), I will use 'explicit' to set L=3 to ensure a higher safety stock to buffer against these delays and potential losses. For demand (mu_hat), N=12 covers the high-demand regime from P16-P27. For sigma_hat, N=12 captures the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Supply unreliability remains the primary risk; order from Period 19 (164 units) is now definitively categorized as lost (9 periods elapsed), following the precedent of P2, P6, and P8. Demand remains stable in the higher regime (~130/period).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) with a demand regime that shifted significantly around Period 16, stabilizing at approximately 130-135 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; orders from Period 19 (164 units) as well as historical periods P2, P6, and P8 are considered lost. The lead time for successful deliveries typically oscillates between 1 and 3 periods, often manifesting in paired arrivals. Currently, there are 630 units in-transit (orders placed sequentially in internal logic across the last few periods), though recent shipments have been delayed. To recover service levels while acknowledging the higher demand regime, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of typical actual lead times) to ensure the target base stock covers the extended arrival window. mu_hat is set to roughly 132 units per period (the detected regime) multiplied by (1+L). sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the heightened volatility observed in the new regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 30, the primary concern is the extreme unreliability of the supply chain and current zero on-hand inventory. History shows that orders from periods 2, 6, 8, and now 19 (11 periods ago) are definitively lost. The remaining in-transit inventory (630 units) consists of orders from P17, P24, and any orders placed between P24-P29 (which were nil based on the history log). However, looking at P30 'In-transit: 630', and knowing P24=80, P23=7(arrived), P21=88(arrived), P19=164(lost), P17=72, P16=36(arrived), P14=17(arrived); it appears substantial orders were placed in the bridge between the snippets or P24-P29 that are not explicitly detailed in the 'conclude' text but are in the 'In-transit' total. Demand since Period 16 has shifted to a higher regime (~125-130 units), though the last few periods (P27-P29) have been lower (89, 115, 76). Given the frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last 7 periods), the priority is returning to a base stock level that accounts for the frequent loss of shipments. I set L=3 to be conservative regarding delivery timing and use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat to capture the post-P16 demand shift while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (45) to account for the high demand variance and supply uncertainty.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is highly unreliable. Historical analysis confirms that orders placed in even-numbered periods (P2, P6, P8, P10 except one instance, P24, P26) or specific odd orders (P19) have a high probability of loss or extreme delay (>9 periods). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and despite an in-transit balance of 630 units, no arrivals have occurred in the last 7 periods (since P23). Demand has stabilized in a higher regime of approximately 130 units per period since Period 16. Given the consistent stockouts and lost orders, I must set the OR parameters to aggressive levels to trigger a significant reorder and compensate for the failed pipeline. I am using an explicit lead time of 3 (the upper end of observed successful arrivals) and an explicit mu_hat reflecting the current demand regime (~130 units) scaled for the lead-time window (1+3). Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to account for the extreme supply-side volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply crisis: No arrivals observed for 7 consecutive periods (P24-P30) despite 630 units in transit. High unreliability of even-period orders and P19 confirmed. Demand stable at ~125-130 units/period since P16.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis with no arrivals observed since Period 25 (6 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The current 'In-transit' total of 767 units is highly misleading as it includes several almost certainly lost orders (P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24). Specifically, P19 (164 units) is now 12 periods old. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime (~125 units/period) since Period 16. With 0 on-hand inventory and the OR engine's tendency to subtract pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must set the lead time (L) explicitly higher and use a recent demand window to ensure the backend generates an order. Setting L to 3 reflects the upper bound of previously successful odd-period arrivals, and using the last 16 periods (P16-P31) for mu_hat correctly captures the current demand regime (~120-130 range).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: zero units arrived between P26 and P31. The 767 'In-transit' units are predominantly comprised of lost shipments (P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24). Demand regime remains stable at ~125-130 units/period since Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2083.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has emerged from a significant collapse where no units arrived between P26 and P31. The order from P31 arrived in P32 with an actual lead time of 1 period, suggesting a potential restoration of the 'odd-period ordering' reliability. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units. Historical data indicates a high-demand regime starting Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 125-130 units per period. The 630 units currently 'In-transit' are largely composed of lost orders (P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24), which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. To counteract this, I will set 'L' to an 'explicit' value of 2 to match the promised lead time while ensuring we cover a 3-period demand window (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the higher demand regime from Period 17 onwards, and similarly for sigma_hat. This strategy aims to force the OR backend to order enough to satisfy the current demand regime despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain partially recovered: P31 order arrived with L=1 in Period 32. Total 'lost' units in current pipeline estimated at ~493 (P19, P21, P23, P24). Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~125 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable, with many historical orders (P19, P21, P23, P24, totaling ~478 units) treated as lost due to extreme lead times (>8 periods). Current inventory is zero. Recent demand (P16-P33) has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 115 units, though volatility is high. The order placed in P31 arrived successfully with L=1 in P32, showing the system is still functional for very recent orders. To recover from the current stockout and the loss of earlier pipeline stock, I am setting L=1 (reflecting the most recent successful delivery) and mu_hat to cover this period and the next using an explicit value of 260 (approximately 2 * 130 to account for the current regime). Sigma_hat is set to 60 to allow for higher service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total 'lost' units in transit estimated at ~493 (P19, P21, P24, etc.). Supply chain shows signs of life only with very recent odd-numbered period orders (P31 arrived L=1). Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~115-125 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a significant collapse, with multiple orders from periods 19, 21, 23, and 24 (totaling approx 493 units) likely lost, as they are now 10+ periods overdue. The only recent sign of life was the Period 31 order arriving with L=1. Currently, there are 0 units on hand and 630 units in transit (of which ~493 are likely phantom/lost inventory). The real pipeline inventory is closer to 137 units (630 - 493). Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 125 units per period, though the most recent four periods show a slight dip to an average of 96.5. To recover and mitigate the high stockout risk while acknowledging the 'lost' pipeline units, I will set L to the promised 2 periods (as recent 'real' L was 1 and historical odd L was 3), use a recent N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime, and use explicit sigma_hat to account for high supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Orders from P19, P21, P23, and P24 (approx 493 units) are confirmed lost after 10+ periods. Only very recent odd-period orders (P31) are arriving. Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~120-130 range, despite recent stockout-induced measurement noise.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable, characterized by frequent lost shipments and inconsistent lead times. Orders from P19, P21, P23, and P24 (approximately 493 units) are now confirmed lost after 10+ periods without arrival. The current 'In-transit' figure of 630 units is largely composed of these ghost shipments. Only very recent odd-period orders (like P31) have shown any successful arrival. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 125 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant lost units in the pipeline, a fresh order is required. Setting L=3 reflects the risk of longer lead times observed in successful arrivals, and mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 20 to capture the sustained higher demand regime (~125 units) while acknowledging stockout-influenced lower recorded values.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Orders from P19, P21, P23, and P24 (approx 493 units) are lost. The 'In-transit' metric is currently misleading due to these non-arriving units. Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~120-130 units per period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. Orders from P19, P21, P23, and P24 (approximately 493 units) are definitively lost as they have exceeded 12 periods since placement. The current 'In-transit' of 630 units is largely composed of these ghost units. Only orders from odd-numbered periods (like P31) show any reliability. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since P16, averaging approximately 115-125 units per period. Because the backend OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes the lost units, it under-orders. I will use 'explicit' methods to override this. L is set to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I estimate (1+L)*mean_demand = (1+2)*125 = 375. However, since the OR engine subtracts the 'ghost' pipeline (approx 493 units) from its base stock calculation, a standard base stock would result in zero orders. To force an order that accounts for the fact that the pipeline is nearly zero (not 630), I must inflate mu_hat. Actual needed base_stock for a 95% service level is approx 500 units. To get the engine to order ~125 units when it thinks pipeline=630, mu_hat must be set very high to offset the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Orders P19, P21, P23, and P24 (totaling ~493 units) are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure is permanently inflated by these units, requiring 'explicit' mu_hat adjustments to force replenishment.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant collapse. As established in the carry-over insights, approximately 493 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline from earlier orders (P19, P21, P23, P24) are confirmed lost after 10+ periods. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these lost units as available pipeline inventory, preventing it from placing new orders while on-hand remains at 0 and demand persists at ~125 units/period. To force the backend to order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock as (L+1) * demand_regime + buffer, then add the count of lost units (~493) to that target. With L=2, (1+2)*125 = 375. Adding 493 'ghost' units results in an explicit mu_hat of 868. This forces the backend to bypass the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=15) to capture the higher volatility seen since Period 16.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Since Period 19, multiple orders (P19, P21, P24, totaling ~493 units) are confirmed lost, which permanently inflates the 'In-transit' figure to 933. This prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force an order. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 125 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2), the target base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (125 * 3 = 375 units). However, because the backend subtracts the inflated in-transit (933) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when compared to 933, still triggers a significant order to prevent stockouts. I am setting mu_hat = 1500 to ensure replenishment occurs. Lead time is set to 'default' (2) as recent data shows arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: In-transit figure is permanently inflated by ~493 units from confirmed lost orders (P19, P21, P24). Use 'explicit' mu_hat > 1000 to force replenishment until the pipeline inventory is naturally cleared or the game ends.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. We have approximately 493 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline from periods P19, P21, P23, and P24 that are confirmed lost (15+ periods elapsed). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the standard OR backend logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 2000. This extremely high base stock level is necessary to force the capped ordering policy to trigger a replenishment despite the 1481 units currently reported 'In-transit'. Demand remains stable in the 120-130 range post-P16, but current on-hand is 0, leading to ongoing stockouts. By forcing a large order now, we aim to overcome the pipeline inflation and secure stock for the final 10 periods of the game. I will keep L at default (2) as the backend uses it for the ordering cap calculation.

Carry-over insight: In-transit figure is permanently inflated by ~493 units from lost orders P19, P21, P23, and P24. 'Explicit' mu_hat > 1000 is required until the game ends or 'In-transit' is corrected to ensure replenishment occurs despite the phantom inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $732.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, on-hand inventory is 484 units, which is approximately 4-5 periods of demand (mean ~115-125 units/period). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1492 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost orders (P19, P21, P23, P24 - approx 493 units) and potentially other older unarrived orders. The supply chain has shown recent life with P39 arriving in only 1 period (L=1). Despite the phantom 'In-transit' stock, we must maintain a high mu_hat to ensure the OR backend's capped policy continues to place orders if the real pipeline is exhausted, especially since even-period orders (like the one currently being decided for P41) have historically been high-risk. We will set mu_hat explicitly high (1000) to ensure we don't stop ordering due to the phantom inventory, while assuming a lead time of 2 for safety.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain volatility remains high: Period 39 arrived with L=1 in Period 40. In-transit inventory remains permanently inflated by at least 493 units (P19, P21, P23, P24), and likely more from subsequent lost periods (P25-P30), meaning the backend pipeline logic will significantly underestimate true replenishment needs unless mu_hat is set explicitly high.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a significant portion of the 'In-transit' metric (1492 units) actually being lost or significantly delayed shipments (P19, P21, P23, P24, P25-P30). Recent arrivals (P31, P39) suggest that new orders placed in odd periods with very high mu_hat values are the only way to bypass the 'phantom inventory' logic in the OR backend. On-hand inventory is currently 337 units, which covers approximately 2.5 periods of demand (mean demand \u2248 130). Since orders placed now (P42) follow the even-period ordering history which has a 100% loss/failure rate in this simulation, I will skip ordering this period to avoid wasting capital on likely-to-be-lost shipments. I will wait for Period 43 (an odd period) to place a massive replenishment order. I am maintaining the 'explicit' mu_hat strategy to prepare for the backend's pipeline calculations in the next period.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed even-period order risk. All orders from P2, P6, P8, P24, P26, P28, P30 appear lost. Effective replenishment only occurs via aggressive odd-period ordering to overcome the ~1000+ units of phantom in-transit inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is severely compromised, with a large portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (approximately 1,189 units from P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, and P30) being definitively or likely lost. Specifically, orders from P19-P30 (at least 550 units) have far exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods without arriving. The current 'In-transit' of 1,492 is thus visually dominated by 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 2,200. This value is mathematically chosen to exceed the current pipeline (1,492) plus on-hand (177) significantly enough to trigger the OR backend to place a new order, ensuring continuous replenishment through Period 50. I am maintaining L as 'default' (2) to align with the average behavior of arriving orders, and sigma_hat as 'default' as the primary bottleneck is phantom inventory rather than demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure is extensive: ~1,189 \u2018phantom\u2019 units exist in the in-transit queue (P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, P30). Effective ordering requires mu_hat > (In-transit + On-hand) to bypass the backend's automated pipeline logic.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable, with a significant 'phantom pipeline' of approximately 1,189 units (orders from P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, P30) that have exceeded the 3-period lead time and are likely lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1,550 includes these units, which causes the OR backend to underestimate the need for replenishment. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than 'On-hand + In-transit' to force an order. Since On-hand is 595 and In-transit is 1,550, the total perceived pipeline is 2,145. Even-period orders are historically high-risk, but at Period 44, we must continue aggressive replenishment to ensure stock for the final 6 periods. Mean demand since Period 16 is approximately 120-130 units. To ensure the backend places a meaningful order despite the 2,145 perceived units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,800. This should trigger an order of approximately 500-600 units (accounting for the OR's internal cap). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (averaging ~2).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Estimated 'phantom' in-transit inventory has reached ~1,189 units. Total pipeline (OH + IT) is currently ~2,145 units. Explicit mu_hat > 2200 is required to force replenishment due to backend lead-time logic ignoring shipment losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1765.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by approximately 1,189 'phantom' units in the in-transit queue (orders from P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, P30 which are effectively lost). The combined On-hand (477) and In-transit (2303) sum to 2780 units. Because the OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) assumes these 2780 units will arrive, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than this figure. Current demand regime since P16 is ~125-130 units/period. To force the backend to place an order that overcomes the phantom inventory and covers future demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3200 units. For lead time, I am using L=2 (promised) as it remains the most frequent actual realization for successful shipments, and it stabilizes the backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at ~1,189 units. Total pipeline (OH + IT) is 2,780. To ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' values > 3000 to bypass backend inventory logic that counts lost orders as available supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1386.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high unreliability, with approximately 1,189 'phantom' units in the in-transit queue (orders from P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, and P30) that have not arrived and are likely lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 970 and reported in-transit is 2,179, totaling 3,149 units of pipeline inventory according to the backend. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime of approximately 125-130 units per period since Period 16. To ensure continued replenishment as we approach the end of the game (Period 46 of 50) and to bypass the backend's logic which counts lost shipments as available supply, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value higher than the current pipeline sum. Setting mu_hat to 3500 ensures the capped policy allows for ordering if needed to maintain a safety buffer, while L=recent_2 reflects the recent 1-3 period lead time variability (averaging 2).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom in-transit inventory remains estimated at ~1,189 units. Total pipeline (OH + IT) is 3,149. Continued use of 'explicit' mu_hat > 3200 is necessary to force replenishment against the backend's automated pipeline logic which assumes all in-transit units will arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1290.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains heavily compromised by 'phantom' in-transit inventory, totaling approximately 1,189 units from chronically lost orders (P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, P30). Currently, On-hand (857) + In-transit (2605) equals 3,462 units. In the backend logic, the order quantity is roughly calculated as base_stock - (On-hand + In-transit). To bypass this and force actual replenishment for the remaining 4 periods, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value higher than the current pipeline sum plus the expected demand buffer. Setting mu_hat to 3800 ensures that the backend continues to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, which is necessary to maintain service levels in the face of erratic delivery patterns and the massive volume of lost units. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P39, P40, P43) averaged around 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is confirmed at ~1,189 units based on a deep analysis of non-concluded orders from Periods 2-30. Total reported pipeline (OH+IT) is 3,462, but 'effective' pipeline is closer to 2,273.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is 804 units with 3,022 units reported in transit. However, based on the historical pattern (P2, P6, P8, P19, P21, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, P30), approximately 1,189 units are 'phantom' and will never arrive. The total pipeline (OH + IT) reported by the backend is 3,826. Since the game ends in Period 50, and actual lead times vary between 1-3 periods, any order placed now must arrive within 2 periods to be useful. The backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent orders from being placed because the reported pipeline (3,826) far exceeds the demand for the remaining periods. To bypass this and ensure we maintain stock for the final two periods (49 and 50), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 4500. This is significantly higher than the reported pipeline (3,826), forcing the OR engine to place a replenishment order. This ensures we don't stock out at the very end due to phantom inventory inflating the system's supply perception.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Pipeline remains heavily distorted by ~1,189 phantom units. Explicit mu_hat > 4000 is used to overcome backend pipeline calculation and ensure availability for the final game periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49 of 50. The supply chain is heavily distorted by approximately 1,189 'phantom' units (confirmed lost orders from early and middle periods). Our current On-hand is 739 and reported In-transit is 3791. However, the effective pipeline is significantly lower. With only one period remaining after this one, and a lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, orders placed now only benefit us if they arrive in Period 50 (L=1). Orders with L >= 2 will not resolve before the game ends. Recent demand (P47-48) has dropped significantly (avg ~60), though the overall regime since P16 is ~125. Since actual lead time is unpredictable and we are at the penultimate period, we must maintain a high mu_hat to ensure the OR backend places an order if its internal (distorted) logic allows, while being mindful that units arriving after P50 incur holding costs without profit. Given the reported pipeline of 4530 (OH+IT), an 'explicit' mu_hat of 5500 is used to force a final safety order, though we expect no further arrivals if lead time exceeds 1.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Final lead-time check: P43 arrived L=2, P40 arrived L=3, P39 arrived L=1. Phantom inventory remains ~1,189 units. Game ending P50; only orders with L=1 placed in P49 will contribute to revenue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final period. The objective is to maximize profit R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Any order placed now in the Period 50 decision phase will arrive, at the earliest, in Period 50 (if L=0) or Period 51 onwards. Since the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50, orders placed now cannot be sold and will only incur holding costs if they were to arrive. Current on-hand inventory is 646 units, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the final period (mean demand ~125). In-transit inventory is extremely high (4864 units) due to previous aggressive ordering to bypass phantom inventory logic. To maximize reward, we must prevent any further ordering. Setting mu_hat to 0 ensures the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will be 0 or near-zero, which is less than the current inventory (on-hand + in-transit), resulting in a final order of 0 units.
