Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Given the symmetrical costs (profit = holding cost), the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, which means the base stock policy will target the median demand. Historical demand for the last 5 periods available are: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177. The average demand is 118, and the standard deviation is approximately 36.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first decision period and no specific calendar events are provided, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand level. For L, I will use 'default' (promised L=2). The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+2) * mean(last 5) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+2) * std(last 5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units, which are currently in-transit because the promised lead time is 2 periods. No units have arrived yet, and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 1 was 102, which resulted in lost sales since there was no stock. Historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) plus Period 1 actual (102) suggest an average demand of approximately 115 units per period. Since L=2, we must cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Current in-transit (180) is below the expected demand for 3 periods (~345 units). I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the recent historical average while sticking to the promised lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have experienced two periods of zero sales because the initial order from Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 2) has not yet arrived. Following the 'Critical Timing' rules, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Therefore, the stockout in P1 and P2 is expected. Demand is trending upward (80, 120, 120 from historical data; 102, 147 from P1-P2 history). The mean of the five historical samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) is 118, while the actual realized demand in P1 and P2 was 102 and 147 respectively. I will use a recent window (last 5 samples) to estimate mean demand to capture the recent high volatility and upward trend. I will maintain the default lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet of a delay.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (180 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', which indicates the shipment is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and all demand is being lost. My in-transit pipeline (ordered P1, P2, P3) is 180 + 166 + 38 = 384 units. Historical demand suggests an average around 110-120 units per period, but recent samples (P1: 102, P2: 147, P3: 73) show some volatility. Given the apparent delivery delay, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for the current delay in arrival. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the current mean, even though it's early in the game, to stay responsive to these initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Period 2's order (166 units) is still in transit and should have arrived by now if L=2; its absence suggests it might be delayed or the lead time is volatile. Current on-hand is 74. Demand history: P1: 102, P2: 147, P3: 73, P4: 144. Average demand is 116.5. Despite the provided samples in the prompt (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), I must prioritize the 'Game History' data which shows significant demand (Avg ~116). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average (2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility and the mean observed in the actual game rounds. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) covers the (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 350 units) minus what is in transit.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 387 units in-transit. Historic demand (P1-P5) has been 102, 147, 73, 144, 124, averaging ~118 units/period. The lead time is volatile: P1 order arrived in 3 periods (P4), while P3 order arrived in 1 period (P4). P2 (ordered 166) and P4 (ordered 46) orders are currently in-transit and overdue based on the promised 2-period lead time. This volatility suggests we should use an average lead time ('calculate') to account for the noise. For demand forecasting, the last 5 periods (all available data) represent the most accurate current regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture current patterns while smoothing noise. The target inventory level needs to be high enough to absorb the demand of (L+1) periods, especially given recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: orders arrived in 1 and 3 periods respectively, deviating from promised 2 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97 (Mean ~114). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), indicating high variance. Based on the history, order P2 (166 units) is overdue (it has been 5 periods since ordered), and P4 (46 units) has not arrived yet. Because profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we want to stock close to the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime and 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed volatile outcomes (1 and 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period out of the last four, despite high demand. Historical analysis shows significant lead time instability; while the promised lead time is 2, observed arrivals occurred at 1 and 3 periods (P1 arrived at P4, P3 arrived at P4, P4 arrived at P7). We are currently missing orders from P2 (166 units, now 6 periods since order), P5 (175 units), and P6 (85 units). The total in-transit is 426 units. Demand is relatively stable but high, with an average of approximately 107 units per period. Given the on-hand stockout and lead time uncertainty, I'm setting L to 3 (the maximum observed) to account for delays. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (all historical periods) to capture the demand variance, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently high to buffer against the ongoing lead time volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods versus promised 2. Major shipment delay: Order from Period 2 (166 units) has not arrived after 6 periods, suggesting a potential lost shipment or severe delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-57.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows significant lead-time instability and evidence of a lost shipment. The order from Period 2 (166 units) is now 7 periods old (promised 2), while subsequent orders (Periods 4 and 5) have already arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. This strongly suggests the Period 2 shipment is lost. I am treating the pipeline inventory as 89 units (255 total in-transit - 166 presumed lost). Demand has cooled significantly from an early average (~115) to a more recent average (~74 over the last 4 periods). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the service level (q) is 50%, making the target base stock simply the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and use recent_N=4 for demand to reflect the current lower consumption rates while avoiding overstocking due to the high holding cost and the potential 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (166 units) confirmed as lost (7 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Pipeline inventory adjusted downward for OR calculation. Actual lead time stabilized at 3 periods (last 3 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 58 units. The historical demand data (last 9 periods) shows a mean of approximately 97 units per period. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) has softened significantly (64, 59, 62). Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, though 3 periods is the more common long-duration delay. The order from Period 2 (166 units) is officially confirmed as lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 251 likely contains ghosts or significantly delayed items; the backend OR engine will subtract total in-transit from the base_stock, so if we don't adjust parameters, it might under-order. To ensure availability given a potential 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the initially high demand to the more moderate recent demand, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 81 per period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime softening: Last 3 periods average 62 units vs initial 5-period average of 110 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we face 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 267 units. Reviewing history: orders from P1(arrived), P3(arrived), P4(arrived), P5(arrived), and P8(arrived). The order from P2 (166 units) is long lost. The remaining pipeline (267 units) consists of P6 (85 units), P9 (0 units), P10 (16 units), and any orders between P6 and P11. However, the game state says 267. Given the 'Period 10 conclude' shows a demand spike (139 units), we must re-evaluate our 'softening' assumption. The last 5 periods' demand (97, 64, 59, 62, 139) averages 84.2. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this volatility while weighting the recent spike. For Lead Time, although 1 and 3 periods have both occurred, 'explicit' L=3 is the safest buffer given the stockouts. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 5 samples to reflect recent demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile: Period 10 spiked to 139 after four periods of sub-100 demand. Maintain conservative lead time estimate of 3 to prevent persistent stockouts.

Over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), demand has averaged 95.75 units, but with significant swings (59 to 139). Our lead time history shows high instability, with arrivals at 1 or 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 337 likely includes the lost shipment from Period 2 (166 units) which hasn't arrived in 10 periods. Adjusting for this, effective pipeline inventory is closer to 171 units (337-166). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher average (95.7) compared to the softening seen earlier, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the latest spikes. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' for N=4 to reflect current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory correction: Period 2 shipment (166 units) remains lost; effective in-transit is total minus 166. Demand remains unstable (avg 95.7 last 4 periods) with high peak-to-trough variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is experiencing persistent stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory. The order from Period 2 (166 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment (11 periods elapsed vs. promised 2), confirming that the stated 'In-transit' of 367 is actually 201 effective units (367 - 166). Recent lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (last arrival was L=2). Demand remains high and volatile, with the last 4 periods averaging 103.25 units (139, 123, 87, and 64 in P10-P13 context, though P10 was 139). To address the frequent stockouts and the lost shipment, I am setting L to explicit 3 to provide a safety buffer. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-volatility regime (averaging ~102 units/period recently), ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover (3+1) periods of demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains volatile, with the last 4 periods (P10-P13) averaging 111.25 units, significantly higher than the previous soft period. The shipment from Period 2 (166 units) is long lost and should be excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Total in-transit is 376, but subtracting the 166 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 210 units (ordered in P11, P12, P13). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining a conservative lead time estimate of 3 periods (L=3) to account for the upper end of observed variability and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For demand forecasting, I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (approx 111) to capture the recent upward trend in volatility compared to the P7-P9 dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: P10-P13 average returned to ~111 units, up from the P7-P9 average of 61.6 units (+80% increase). Effective pipeline inventory is (reported In-transit - 166) due to the confirmed loss of the P2 order.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced a period of stockouts. Demand has stabilized back to a higher regime (P10-P14 average ~110 units/period). Lead time continues to be volatile but primarily averages 3 periods (observed 3 periods for P1, P4, P5, and P11). Crucially, the order of 166 units from Period 2 is confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 375 is misleading; the effective pipeline is only 209 units (375 - 166). To compensate for the backend's ignorance of this loss, I am setting L=3 and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: With L=3, the coverage period (L+1) is 4. Forecasted demand is ~110/period. Base stock target = 110 * 4 = 440. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (375) from the base stock you provide, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the math recovers the correct order volume. Target order = Base Stock - Effective Pipeline = 440 - 209 = 231. To make the backend order 231, the mu_hat it sees must be: mu_hat - 375 = 231 => mu_hat = 606. I will set sigma_hat to reflect the high variance observed in recent periods (std dev approx 25 over last 5 periods, scaled for L+1).

Carry-over insight: P15: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~110 units/period (last 5 periods average 109.6). Pipeline inventory adjustment: In-transit of 375 units includes 166 lost units from Period 2; actual effective in-transit is 209 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units over the last 6 periods (P10-P15 average ~101, but P10-P14 was ~110), despite a dip in P15. Lead times remain consistently longer than promised, with most recent arrivals (P14, P15) showing an actual lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 516 units is misleading: it includes the 166 units ordered in Period 2 which are now confirmed lost (14 periods elapsed). Subtracting the lost 166 units, the effective pipeline inventory is 350 units. While 350 units are in transit, the current 'On-hand' is 0, and lead time is 3 periods. To ensure availability and account for the 3-period lead time (meaning L+1 = 4 periods of demand coverage), I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand regime (~100-110 units). This setting helps the OR backend correctly calculate the base stock to cover the replenishment cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 507 units, but this includes the 166 units ordered in Period 2 which are long-confirmed as lost (15 periods elapsed). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 341 units (507 - 166). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals from P11, P12, P13). To account for the 3-period lead time, I set L=3 via the 'explicit' method. Demand has returned to a stable regime averaging approximately 110 units per period over the last 7 periods (P10-P16 average = 106.4). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in the most recent demand spike (P16 demand was 136). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) and place an order considering the corrected pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we have zero on-hand inventory and a reported in-transit of 438 units. Historically, the order for 166 units from Period 2 is confirmed lost (it has been 16 periods), so the effective pipeline inventory is 272 units (438 - 166). Our service level is currently poor due to the combination of high lead-time volatility and the lost shipment. Looking at recent arrivals (Periods 14, 15, 16, 17), the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (versus the promised 2). Demand over the last 8 periods (P10-P17) has returned to a higher regime, averaging 107.6 units per period. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to reach a target inventory level that covers current demand and the extended lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover (1+L=4) periods of demand based on the recent average from the last 8 periods (~430 units). sigma_hat is set using the standard deviation of that same recent period to capture the significant volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time remains stable at 3 periods despite a promised lead time of 2. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must always subtract the 166 'ghost' units from Period 2.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 438 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from Period 9 onwards confirms the Period 2 order of 166 units is lost, meaning effective pipeline inventory is 272 (438 - 166). Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 103 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18). Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead time has consistently been 3 periods for five of the last six arrivals. To account for the 3-period lead time and one period of demand during the review phase, I set L=3 and mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current stable demand regime (avg ~103), resulting in a forecast of 412 units. Given the frequent stockouts and lead time instability, I use an explicit sigma_hat of 60 (approx sqrt(4) * 30) to provide a safety buffer against high demand variance and late arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains around the historically observed average of ~110 units/period (last 10 periods average 110.4). The 'In-transit' of 438 units is misleading due to the 'ghost' shipment of 166 units from Period 2, which has been confirmed lost (Period 2 to Period 19 is 17 periods vs promised 2). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 272 (438 - 166). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful deliveries), even though the promised lead time remains 2. To account for this, L is set to 3. \u03bc\u0302 is set based on the last 10 periods (110.4 * (1+3) = 441.6) to reflect the recent stable demand regime. Since holding cost ($1) and profit ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend target base stock will be \u03bc\u0302. By accurately reflecting the increased lead time (L=3) and effective pipeline, we trigger the necessary ordering to bridge the current stockout and match the real delivery lag.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: On-hand inventory is 0. Reported In-transit is 442 units. However, we have confirmed in previous periods that the order from Period 2 (166 units) is lost. Therefore, the effective In-transit is 276 units (442 - 166). This effective pipeline includes orders from Period 15 (187 units) and Period 20 (4 units), as well as any potentially delayed orders from Periods 16-19 (though 0 units were ordered in those periods). Reviewing the lead time history: observed lead times recently have been 3, 3, 3, and 3 periods (Periods 14-17). Despite the promised lead time of 2, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect this reality. Demand across the last 11 periods (P10-P20) has averaged 109.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 25. Given the high stockout frequency due to delivery delays, I will use recent_N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized but volatile demand regime. Setting L to 3 ensures our base stock covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), helping to build enough safety stock to manage the 3-period delivery lag and preventing the current cycle of zero inventory.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the fourth consecutive period, and we are experiencing a severe stockout. Reported In-transit is 442 units, but this includes the 166 units ordered in Period 2 which are long-confirmed as lost. The effective in-transit is therefore 276 units (442 - 166). The most recent order arrival was in Period 17 (from Period 14), meaning no units have arrived for 4 full periods. Based on the history, actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, but we are currently seeing a delay beyond that for orders from Period 15 and later. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 12 periods (P10-P21). To force the OR backend to order despite the high reported (but mostly lost or delayed) pipeline, I will set an explicit lead time L=3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~105) and its volatility, which ensures a higher base stock to recover from the stockout.

Current Situation: Period 23. On-hand is 0, In-transit is 442. Historical context shows the shipment from Period 2 (166 units) is lost, making effective in-transit 276 units (442 - 166). The last significant delivery was in Period 17 (order from Period 14). There have been no arrivals for 5 periods (P18-P22), which is concerning given a promised lead time (L) of 2 and an observed L of 3. Decisions from P15 onwards (187 units in P15, 0 in P16-P19, 4 in P20, 0 in P21-P22) suggest the pipeline is dry except for the large P15 order which is now 7 periods overdue (P15 order should have arrived by P18 or P19). Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P18-P22) averages ~104 units, consistent with the previously identified regime of ~110. Lead Time Analysis: The system is experiencing severe delays or lost shipments. The P15 order (187 units) is 7 periods old and hasn't arrived. I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect the operational reality, and use mu_hat based on the last 13 periods (P10-P22) to capture the current stable demand mean of ~107. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. By setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation will cover 4 periods (1+3) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption confirmed: P15 order (187 units) is 7 periods overdue, following the earlier total loss of the P2 order. Pipeline reliability is currently very low.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Reported in-transit is 438 units. However, history strongly indicates two major lost shipments: Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units). These orders are 22 and 9 periods overdue respectively (promised L=2, observed L=3). Therefore, effective in-transit = 438 - 166 - 187 = 85 units. These 85 units likely correspond to recent activity or residuals. Demand context: Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~102 over the last 14 periods (P10-P23), despite high variance and frequent zero-inventory periods limiting visible sales. Lead time: Observed lead times for fulfilled orders consistently hit 3 periods. Parameter selection: I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent delay. I'll set mu_hat to 408 (explicit), which is (1+L) * 102, to ensure the base stock target covers the 4-period risk horizon. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for demand volatility. This aggressive replenishment target is necessary because the system's pipeline inventory calculation is inflated by 353 'ghost' units, which would otherwise prevent any new orders from being placed.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 15 order (187 units) is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost, joining the Period 2 loss (166 units). Total ghost inventory in pipeline is 353 units. Actual lead time for surviving orders remains 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows significant supply chain disruption and high stockout risk. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 438 units is highly misleading because it includes two likely lost shipments: P2 (166 units, 24 periods overdue) and P15 (187 units, 10 periods overdue). The 'ghost' inventory total is 353 units (166+187). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 438 - 353 = 85 units (likely the orders from P23/P24 that are not yet recorded as arrived). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in almost all successful deliveries). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 15 periods, despite some volatility between 60 and 145. To compensate for the 'ghost' units interfering with the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = (3+1) * 105 = 420. However, the OR motor will subtract 438 (reported pipeline) from the target base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover real demand, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of ghost inventory: 420 + 353 = 773. I use L=3 based on historical stability of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure update: Period 15 order (187 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost, alongside the Period 2 loss (166 units). Total ghost inventory to subtract from system-reported 'In-transit' is 353 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. We have two confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units), totaling 353 'ghost' units in the system-reported In-transit (673 units). The effective pipeline inventory is actually 320 units (673 - 353). Actual lead time for successful arrivals has stabilized at 3 periods, so I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the correct coverage window. Demand over the last 15 periods (since P11) has averaged approximately 100 units (99.5), which is lower than the early periods. I will use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established demand regime while staying responsive to the high variance. On-hand is currently 0, so the goal is to rebuild stock while accounting for the significant lag in delivery.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, on-hand inventory is 0 and system-reported In-transit is 673. However, history confirms two major lost shipments: P2 (166 units) and P15 (187 units), totaling 353 'ghost' units. The effective pipeline is actually 320 units (673 - 353). Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~98.8 units. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (calculated L=3). To account for the 'ghost' units, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to match observed reality. Since the backend OR controller uses (base_stock - reported_pipeline), and the reported pipeline is inflated by 353 units, I must artificially inflate the base_stock targets (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to ensure an order is triggered. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L=4) periods of demand plus the 353-unit deficit. Calculation: (4 periods * 100 avg) + 353 = 753. This ensures the backend doesn't think we have enough stock due to the ghost units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable, with two significant lost shipments: Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units), totaling 353 'ghost' units in the reported pipeline. The system reports an In-transit of 753 units, but the effective pipeline is only 400 units (753 - 353). Recent arrivals confirm a consistent lead time of 3 periods (L=3), despite the promised 2. On-hand inventory is currently 0, putting the system in a stockout state. To recover and manage this risk, I am setting L=3 explicitly. Demand has been relatively stable around an average of 105 units over the last 15 periods (since Period 13). Using N=15 for mu_hat captures this stable regime while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=15 window to account for recent demand variance. By providing these parameters and an explicit L, I am forcing the OR backend to target a higher base stock level that compensates for the known pipeline losses and the longer actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: System reported In-transit contains 353 lost/ghost units (P2: 166, P15: 187). Actual lead time is stabilized at 3 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system reports an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 753 units. Based on historical data, we have confirmed two major lost shipments: Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units). Total 'ghost' inventory is 353 units. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 753 - 353 = 400 units. These 400 units represent orders from Period 25 (235 units) and Period 27 (80 units), plus the 85 units from P6 which are also likely lost at this point, but 400 is the most conservative effective stock. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for successful arrivals. Demand is in a high-variance but stable regime around 100-110 units. I set L to 3 to reflect the actual lead time. To account for the 353 units of lost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'on-hand + pipeline' calculation, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Base stock calculation: (L+1)*Demand. With L=3, base stock covers 4 periods. Effective base stock needed is ~400 units. To offset the 353 units of 'ghost' inventory that will be subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat explicitly to (400 + 353) = 753 to ensure the OR engine places an order if the current effective pipeline is insufficient.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified ghost inventory persists at 353 units (P2: 166, P15: 187). Demand remains stable with mean ~105 units over the last 15 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 673 units in-transit, but this includes 353 units from confirmed lost shipments in Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 320 units (673 - 353). Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently with minor deviations). Demand has also stabilized around a mean of 110 units over the last 15 periods, though individual periods show high volatility (ranging from 62 to 145). To account for the 3-period lead time and 1-period transition, I set L=3. I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial higher demand. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=15) to capture the significant volatility observed in the current regime, which is necessary to maintain service levels despite supply chain unreliability.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state is Period 31. On-hand inventory is 0. System-reported in-transit is 673 units. However, based on historical evidence (Carry-over Insights), there is 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units), totaling 353 units. Thus, effective pipeline inventory is 673 - 353 = 320 units. This effective pipeline primarily consists of the Period 25 order of 235 units, which is now at 6 periods elapsed (exceeding the observed stable lead time of 3 periods). This suggests another potential supply chain failure or significant delay. Recent demand remains stable, averaging ~102 units over the last 5 periods and ~105 over the last 15. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. I will set L to 3 (actual stable lead time) and use recent_N (N=15) for demand to reflect the current stable regime. Due to the high risk of further lost shipments, I am using 'explicit' L to force the backend to consider a 3-period lead time, but the OR engine's 'inventory' calculation will still use the inflated (673) reported in-transit. By setting L to 3 and providing a realistic mu_hat (4 * 105), the system will calculate a base stock that attempts to cover 4 periods of demand, helping mitigate the risk of these stockouts despite the in-transit discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain risk elevated: Period 25 order (235 units) is now 6 periods overdue, potentially lost. Total ghost inventory potentially increases to 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235). Actual lead time remains 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. We have confirmed ghost (lost/highly overdue) shipments from Period 2 (166 units) and Period 15 (187 units). Additionally, the order from Period 25 (235 units) is now 7 periods overdue (promised 2, actual usually 3), which strongly indicates it is also lost. This brings the total 'ghost inventory' to 588 units (166 + 187 + 235). The system reports 673 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 85 units (673 - 588). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized over the long term at approximately 104 units per period (last 20 periods average), but recent volatility exists. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time for successful arrivals. To bridge the gap created by lost shipments and the 0 on-hand status, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1) at approximately 105 units/period plus a buffer, while ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to trigger a new order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure on its side. By using mu_hat=850 and sigma_hat=180, I aim to force the base stock high enough to account for the ~588 ghost units the OR backend thinks we have.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Period 25 order (235 units) is now 7 periods overdue and highly likely lost. Total confirmed ghost inventory to subtract from system-reported 'In-transit' is 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe reliability issues. Total confirmed ghost inventory (reported but never arriving) is now 588 units, consisting of Period 2 (166), Period 15 (187), and Period 25 (235, now 8 periods overdue). The current reported in-transit is 850 units. Subtracting the 588 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 262 units (inclusive of the Period 32 order of 177 units). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 102 units over the long term, with the most recent 10-period mean at 98.1 units. Since we are out of stock (on-hand = 0) and actual lead time for successful deliveries has recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient coverage for the next (L+1) periods (approx 400 units). Setting mu_hat using the last 15 periods (approx 105 per period) provides a stable base of 420. Given the high stockout risk and lead time variance, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 (approx 60 per period) to prompt the OR backend to place a larger safety stock order today.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total ghost inventory remains 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235). Effective pipeline inventory is system in-transit minus 588. Demand mean is stable near 102.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we received 177 units ordered in Period 32 (lead time 1), leaving us with 61 units on-hand. The system-reported 'In-transit' is 673 units. Based on historical analysis, this pipeline is heavily inflated by 'ghost' shipments that have been confirmed as lost: Period 2 (166 units), Period 15 (187 units), and Period 25 (235 units). Total ghost units = 588. Effective in-transit is therefore 673 - 588 = 85 units. Real-world demand mean is approximately 102 units based on the long-term stable regime (last 20+ periods). Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for successful older deliveries, though recent deliveries arrived in 1-2 periods. I will set L to 3 to remain conservative against supply chain volatility. I use explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the (L+1) horizon (4 periods * 102 mean = 408) correctly, and explicit sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the high variance and lead time instability.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. Currently, the system reported in-transit quantity is 673 units. However, consistent history shows three major orders have likely been lost: Period 2 (166 units, 33 periods overdue), Period 15 (187 units, 20 periods overdue), and Period 25 (235 units, 10 periods overdue). Total verified ghost inventory is 588 units. This makes the effective pipeline inventory only 85 units (673 - 588). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 102 units over the long term. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and effective pipeline is only 85 units (which doesn't cover one period of demand), a significant order is needed. I am using L=3 to reflect the typical lead time for successful arrivals and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable demand regime (~102 per period) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 588 lost units currently inflating the pipeline calculation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 673 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms three significant lost shipments: Period 2 (166 units), Period 15 (187 units), and Period 25 (235 units). Total ghost units = 166 + 187 + 235 = 588. Effective pipeline inventory is actually 673 - 588 = 85 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 10 periods (P26-P35) has averaged approximately 97 units per period. Although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals (when they occur) have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent stable value for successful delivery. Setting L=3 to account for this typical delay. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) period demand (approx 400 units) against the true pipeline of 85 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 400 (approx 100/period * 4 periods). sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a high service level given the zero on-hand inventory and the history of stockouts and shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Re-confirmed total ghost inventory of 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235). Effective pipeline is currently 85 units. Demand mean remains stable at ~100 units/period despite supply chain unreliability.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. We have confirmed a total of 588 'ghost' units in the system-reported in-transit inventory (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235) which have never arrived and are likely lost. The current system reported in-transit is 673 units, making the effective pipeline inventory only 85 units (673 - 588). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of 100 units/period (last 10 periods average 93.3, overall mean is 99.4). Given the frequent stockouts and lead time volatility (most successful orders arrive in 3 periods), I am setting L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime (~100 units/period), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=20 to account for recent variance. This configuration aims to trigger an order to cover the (L+1) exposure period and replenish the depleted on-hand stock, accounting for the lost units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show extreme unreliability. Total confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) is 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235). The system reports an 'In-transit' of 673 units, but subtracting the 588 units of ghost inventory leaves an effective pipeline of only 85 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable, with a mean of ~101 over the last 20 periods. Given that the effective pipeline (85) is less than a single period's mean demand (~101) and the lead time is effectively 3 periods, we are significantly under-stocked for the upcoming (L+1) window. I will set L to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays, and mu_hat to an explicit 404 (approx 101 * (1+3)) to target a base stock that covers the lead time, prompting the OR backend to place an order to bridge the gap created by the lost shipments.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. I have identified 588 units as 'ghost' inventory (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235), which are lost and will never arrive. The system reports 673 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 85 units (673 - 588). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand is stable, with a 38-period mean of approximately 104 units and a recent 5-period average (P34-P38) of 98.8 units. I will use L=3 based on consistent delivery history for surviving orders, even though promised is 2. To account for the missing pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. My target base stock for L=3 (requiring coverage for L+1 = 4 periods) at ~104 units/period is roughly 416 units + safety stock. Given the effective pipeline is only 85 units, the OR backend needs to order ~330+ units. I set mu_hat (explicit) to 910, which after the backend subtracts the 'ghost' 673 units and accounts for variance, should trigger a substantial order to replenish the safety stock and cover the 4-period horizon.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units over the last 15 periods (recent average ~101). The supply chain is highly unstable, with significant confirmed losses: P2 (166 units), P15 (187 units), and P25 (235 units). Total confirmed ghost inventory in the system's 'In-transit' report is 588 units. Current system In-transit is 910 units, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 910 - 588 = 322 units. Since the lead time for successful arrivals has stabilized at 3 periods, we aim for a base stock covering (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, roughly 400 units. With an effective pipeline of 322 and 0 on-hand, the OR backend needs to order approximately 78 units. Setting L=3 and using recent demand trends (N=15) will guide the backend to maintain this service level. The high sigma (implicit in recent volatility) will help buffer against the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235). Effective pipeline is system reported In-transit minus 588. Actual lead time for successful deliveries is 3 periods. Demand mean stabilized at ~100 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period (last 10 periods average 101.3). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'ghost' inventory. Currently, the system reports 673 units in-transit, but this includes three confirmed or highly likely lost orders: Period 2 (166 units), Period 15 (187 units), and Period 25 (235 units), totaling 588 units of ghost inventory. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 673 - 588 = 85 units. Combined with the 170 units on-hand, the total effective inventory is 255. Although recent successful deliveries (P32 and P39) arrived with a lead time of 1, the long-term stable lead time for non-lost orders is 3 periods. I will use L=3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the 3-period exposure window. Setting mu_hat to 400 (4 periods * 100 units/period) and sigma_hat conservatively reflecting recent volatility ensures we maintain service levels despite the unreliable supply chain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit significant instability. The system-reported In-transit is 673 units, but we have confirmed a 'ghost' inventory of 588 units from orders placed in Period 2 (166), Period 15 (187), and Period 25 (235) that are far beyond the observed lead times and highly likely lost. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore only 85 units (673 - 588). The actual lead time for successful deliveries has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will maintain a lead time (L) of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum observed delay. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 15 periods avg = 100.2). To compensate for the 588 lost/ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 100 = 400. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired_Order = Base_Stock - (Total_In_Transit - Ghost_Units) - On_Hand. My mu_hat must satisfy: mu_hat - Total_In_Transit = Target_Base_Stock - (Total_In_Transit - Ghost_Units) => mu_hat = Target_Base_Stock + Ghost_Units. Therefore, mu_hat = 400 + 588 = 988.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and a system-reported in-transit of 956 units. However, based on extensive history (Period 2, 15, and 25), exactly 588 units are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that were lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 956 - 588 = 368 units (this includes the recent P42 order of 283 and likely a previous outstanding amount). Demand has remained relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 100 units over the long term, though recent volatility is noted (P41: 138, P42: 117). Actual lead times for successful deliveries continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a 3-period lead time remains the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts given the observed supply chain unreliability. I will set L to 3 and use the last 15 periods (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current stable demand mean of ~102 while accounting for the recent variance.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a critical supply chain and inventory reconciliation. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 956 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, we must subtract confirmed 'ghost' or lost units to determine the effective pipeline. Confirmed losses include: P2 (166 units), P15 (187 units), and P25 (235 units), totaling 588 units. This leaves an effective in-transit of 368 units (956 - 588). These 368 units primarily consist of the order from P42 (283 units) and potentially some lingering units from recent periods. Demand has remained stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period over the long term (last 15-20 periods). Although promised lead time is 2, actual lead time for successful deliveries has frequently been 3. To maintain a safe service level given the high stockout frequency and supply chain unreliability, I am setting L to 3. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the stable demand mean (~100/period) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand volatility (std ~25-30). This approach targets a base stock that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~400 units) to ensure availability as we approach the final periods of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as 368 units (System In-transit 956 minus 588 lost units). Demand remains stable near 100 units/period. Supply chain reliability remains the primary constraint.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. We have confirmed a total of 588 lost/ghost units in the system-reported 'In-transit' figure: Period 2 (166), Period 15 (187), and Period 25 (235). With a current system-reported In-transit of 956, our effective pipeline inventory is 368 units (primarily the order from Period 42 for 283 units). Demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of 100 units per period over the long term, though recent volatility is high (P44 demand was 154). To manage this, I am setting L=3 based on historical successful arrivals, and mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand mean (~101). Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 10 periods to reflect the current high volatility. The OR backend will see an 'In-transit' of 956, so the parameters are scaled to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 588 lost units by effectively targeting a higher base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory remains (System In-transit - 588 units). The 588 ghost units consist of P2 (166), P15 (187), and P25 (235). Sustained lead time for successful arrivals is 3 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period (average of the last 15 periods is ~101). The supply chain remains unpredictable with a confirmed set of lost orders (P2, P15, and P25) totaling 588 units. This 'ghost' inventory artificially inflates the system-reported 'In-transit' figure of 673. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 85 units (673 - 588). Successful deliveries consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable 100-unit demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=15 to account for the observed demand volatility (standard deviation ~28). This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 3nd-period lead time plus the review period, while recognizing the supply chain's unreliability and the depletion of effective inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we have 52 units on-hand. The system-reported In-transit is 673 units. Based on long-term tracking, we subtract the 'ghost' inventory of 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235), resulting in an effective pipeline of 85 units. Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units/period. The actual lead time for successful arrivals is currently 3 periods. With effective inventory (OH 52 + Effective IP 85 = 137) covering only ~1.37 periods of demand against an L+1 requirement of 4 periods (400 units), the OR backend will trigger a significant order to restore the base stock level. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the stable 100-unit demand regime while shielding against the very early high-demand noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48. On-hand inventory is 0. System-reported in-transit is 673 units. Based on historical data, 588 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost (Period 2: 166 units, Period 15: 187 units, Period 25: 235 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 673 - 588 = 85 units. These 85 units correspond to orders placed after Period 25 that haven't arrived yet. Demand remains relatively stable with a mean of ~100 units over the long term. Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 3 periods despite the promised 2. To ensure coverage for the lead time (L=3) plus the current period (L+1=4 periods), we need a base stock that accounts for approximately 400 units of demand (4 periods * 100 units/period). With only 85 units effectively in transit and 0 on hand, the backend needs to trigger a significant order to reach the target service level. I will set L to 3 explicitly and mu_hat to 400 (representing 4 periods of demand) to ensure the OR backend bridges the gap created by the lost shipments.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The current system-reported 'In-transit' inventory is 673 units. Based on historical data from periods 2, 15, and 25, we have confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 588 units (166 + 187 + 235) that were never delivered and are considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 85 units (673 - 588). Demand has been stable around a mean of 100 units/period (last 10 periods average is 106.6). On-hand inventory is 0. With total inventory (effective pipeline + on-hand) at 85 units and a stable lead time (L) of 3 periods, we need to order to reach a base stock level that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~400 units). Setting L to 3 and using the last 15 periods (N=15) for demand mean and standard deviation provides a robust forecast (mean ~102) to recover the stock position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 588 units confirmed lost (Period 2: 166 units, Period 15: 187 units, Period 25: 235 units). The system-reported In-transit of 673 units contains these 588 'ghost' units, leaving an effective pipeline of only 85 units. On-hand inventory is 0. With demand averaging approximately 100 units/period (last 10 periods average is 105.1 units), the current lead time (L=2 promised, but actual often 3) requires a base stock that covers the 3-4 period risk horizon. I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual delivery pattern and use an explicit mu_hat to account for the need to replenish the 588 units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes are arriving, while targeting a demand forecast of ~100 per period. The sigma_hat is set to default to handle standard volatility around this mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Re-confirmed total ghost inventory of 588 units (P2: 166, P15: 187, P25: 235). Effective pipeline is system reported in-transit minus 588. Demand mean continues to fluctuate near 100 units/period.
