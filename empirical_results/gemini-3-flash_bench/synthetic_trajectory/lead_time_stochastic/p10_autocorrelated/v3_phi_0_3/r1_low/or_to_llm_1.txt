The OR recommendation of 180 units is based on a base-stock policy using this distribution and the promised lead time. Since this is the first decision and we have no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments yet, the OR recommendation is a sound baseline to establish initial pipeline inventory and minimize future stockouts while respecting the holding cost.

Following the game sequence, if the lead time of 2 holds, the P1 order (180 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest an average of ~118. Recent demand in P1 (102) and P2 (147) averages ~125. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 14 units. This low number is because the OR sees 346 units in the pipeline against a base stock calculation that considers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, the pipeline of 346 covers nearly 3 periods of demand (~375 units). Adjustment: Since we are at the very start of the cycle with 0 on-hand and significant pipeline inventory expected to arrive this period (P1 order) and next period (P2 order), ordering a large amount would likely lead to high holding costs once those shipments arrive. However, the OR recommendation of 14 is very conservative.

However, since the Period 2 order (166 units) and Period 3 order (30 units) are also in-transit, I am currently tracking 376 units total in the pipeline. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been 102, 147, and 73 in the first three periods (avg ~107). Because arrivals are late, we have fulfilled zero demand so far (total lost sales = 322). 3. OR Baseline: OR recommends 0 units. This is because the pipeline (376) far exceeds the base-stock level calculated from historical demand (approx 80-120 range). 4. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 0. We have 376 units in-transit, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand even if lead time is slightly longer than promised.

Demand Analysis: A significant regime shift occurred around Period 7. Pre-P7 average demand was ~110, but the last 3 periods (P7-P9) have averaged ~62. High stockouts in earlier periods (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7) make historical 'sold' data unreliable, but raw demand is clearly trending lower. 4. OR Strategy: OR recommends 0, likely because the 119 on-hand + 296 in-transit (note: the 'In-transit' figure of 296 includes the 130 from P6 and potentially the 166 from P2 which were previously flagged as lost, bringing total pipeline to 415) exceeds its calculated base stock for the current lower demand. 5. Decision: Given the lower demand (62/period) and 119 units on hand, I have ~2 periods of stock. However, the P6 order (130) is significantly overdue.

Previous carry-over insights confirmed P2 and P6 shipments were lost. Examining recent orders: P15 (100 units) is now at lead_time=4 (likely lost), P17 (100 units) is at lead_time=2, and P18 (100 units) is at lead_time=1.

Lead Time & Pipeline: The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead time is volatile (1-3 periods) with a ~50% shipment failure rate. Looking at the history, the order from P33 (120 units) and the order from P34 (120 units) are the only potentially active shipments. However, P34 conclude showed 0 arrivals, so the P33 order is now 2 periods old. Following the ~50% failure rate logic, we must place a new order to ensure continuity, as the P33 order might be lost or the P34 order might be delayed. Strategy: I will ignore the OR recommendation of 0 because it relies on the false pipeline data. I will order 120 units to cover approximately 1.5 periods of demand and hedge against the high supplier failure rate.",

Specifically, orders from P29 (120), P30 (120), and P33 (120) have failed to arrive within the typical 1-3 period window and are now classified as lost inventory. Currently, the local on-hand inventory is 0. The only reliable active shipment in the pipeline is the order from Period 34 (120 units) and Period 35 (120 units). However, given the ~50% supplier failure rate, there is a high probability that one or both of these will not arrive. Demand has stabilized around 90-100 units.

The actual pipeline shows a total in-transit of 1636 units, but history confirms a ~50% shipment loss rate. The active reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 41 (120 units) and Period 42 (120 units), as older orders are likely lost and the Period 40 order just arrived. \n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 42 units. Expected demand for P44 is ~100 units. Since arrivals happen after the decision phase, P44 demand must be met with current on-hand (42) plus any arriving units. There is a high risk of stockout if no shipment arriving in P44 results from P41 (which would be lead_time=3) or P42 (lead_time=2). \n4. **Correction of OR Recommendation**: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the 1636 'In-transit' units as available inventory. However, ~1396 of these units are confirmed lost/phantom. To maintain a safety stock against a 50% loss rate and cover 2-3 periods of future demand (~300 units), more inventory must be ordered. \n5. **Decision**: I will order 120 units to maintain the current ordering cadence, compensating for the high probability that roughly half of the pipeline will never arrive.",
