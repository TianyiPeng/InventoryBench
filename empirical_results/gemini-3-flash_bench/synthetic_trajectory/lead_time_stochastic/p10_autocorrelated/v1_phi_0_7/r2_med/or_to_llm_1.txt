The promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at the historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), the average demand is approximately 86.4 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 107 units based on a base-stock policy that considers the promised lead time (L=2) and historical demand data. Since actual lead time can only be confirmed once orders arrive and there is no seasonality info for 'Period_1', following the OR recommendation is the most prudent starting strategy.

This confirms that the Period 1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 303 (Sum of orders from P1: 107, P2: 111, P3: 85). Because arrivals happen AFTER the decision, even if the P1 order arrives this period, it cannot satisfy demand until the end of the period. 3.

Strategy: The OR recommendation is extremely low (11 units) because it sees a massive pipeline (303) and assumes a lead time of 2. However, with the P1 order (107 units) delayed, we are currently stocking out (sold=0 in P1-P3). Even if the 303 units arrive, they only cover roughly 3 periods of demand.

However, subtracting the lost P2 order (111 units), the effective pipeline is 270 (P6=150, P8=120). Total effective inventory position is 419 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P4-P8) averages 139.8 units, significantly higher than the initial history of 86. The OR algorithm recommendation of 0 is likely based on the promise of a 2-period lead time and the raw in-transit number (381) which includes the lost units. 4. Strategy: To cover 3 periods of demand (current + 2 lead time) at the current mean of ~140, I need approximately 420 units. My effective inventory position is 419. While the OR recommends 0, it doesn't account for the lost P2 shipment or the sustained demand shift.

The current mean over the last 10 periods is approximately 121. Despite the recent dip, I must prepare for the variability seen previously.\n\n3. **Inventory & OR Recommendation**: On-hand is 90.

Inventory & OR Review: On-hand is 42. OR recommends 0 because it sees 601 in transit against a low recent demand. If we remove the 150 (P6) units from the pipeline, we still have 450 in transit.

Currently, 411 units are in-transit, specifically from P17 (150 units). Based on the pattern, the P17 order should arrive between P18 and P20.\n2. Demand Analysis: After a period of lower demand (~70), the last three periods show a rising trend (P15: 84, P16: 89, P17: 107). Current effective mean demand is approximately 95-100 units. \n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Ending inventory is 0. The total pipeline is 411 units, but effectively only the 150 units from P17 are 'fresh' and reliable. The remaining 261 units in 'In-transit' likely include older lost shipments (verified in Carry-over insights as P2 and P6). Excluding these lost 261 units (111 + 150), the active pipeline is 150 units.\n4. Strategy: To cover demand for the lead time (avg 2-3 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 4 periods), we need roughly 400 units (100 units/period * 4). With 150 units reliably in-transit and 0 on-hand, we have a deficit of approximately 250 units. The OR recommends 0 because it likely accounts for the 411 units in-transit (including the lost ones).

After a slump (~70 units), the last three periods show demand of 107, 107, and 109 (average ~108). 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR suggests 0 units because it views the raw 'In-transit' of 561 as sufficient, failing to account for the 261 lost units. 5. **Strategy**: With 0 on-hand and demand rising, I must maintain the flow. The 300 effective pipeline units cover roughly 2.7 periods of demand (300/108).

This is a significant increase from the previous trough (~72 units) and requires higher inventory levels to satisfy.\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 701 units 'In-transit'. However, historical data confirms that P2 (111 units) and P6 (150 units) are permanently lost (confirmed in Carry-Over Insights). Furthermore, P17 (150 units) and P18 (150 units) are currently 3 and 2 periods old respectively. Given the observed volatile lead times (1-3 periods), these should arrive soon. P19 (140 units) is also in the pipeline.\n3. **Effective Pipeline**: Excluding lost orders (P2, P6), the effective pipeline is 440 units (P17, P18, P19). \n4. **Safety & Stockout Risk**: We have had 0 sales for the last 3 periods due to stockouts. While 440 units are in-transit, none arrived in Period 19. Relying on the OR recommendation of 0 is dangerous because it assumes all 701 units in the raw pipeline are valid and that demand is lower than the current trend.\n5. **Strategy**: I will order 150 units.

Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 701 units leaves an effective pipeline of only 140 units (P19).

My total effective inventory (293) already satisfies this. However, since the P19 order is now 8 periods old and hasn't arrived, there is a high probability that it is also lost. If P19 is lost, effective inventory is only 153 units, which is insufficient. \n5. **Adjustment**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it doesn't account for lost shipments and sees a large 'In-transit' number. Given the consistent pattern of losses (P2, P6, P17, P18, and likely P19), I must assume a high shipment failure rate.

However, based on history, orders P2 (111), P6 (150), P17 (150), P18 (150), and P19 (140) are definitively lost (all >10 periods overdue). Total lost units = 701.

Order P29 (placed P29, L=2) should have arrived in P31 conclude; it is now 2 periods late. Order P30 is 1 period late.

Orders P29, P30, P33, and P34 are the only reliable 'In-transit' items (total ~460 units).\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (Periods 29-34) has averaged approximately 106 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 0.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: The effective 'In-transit' amount (excluding confirmed lost orders) is 460 units. Specifically: P29 (120), P30 (120), P33 (100), and P34 (120). Based on recent performance, P29 and P30 should have arrived by now; their non-appearance in the Period 34 conclude message suggests a potential delay or loss, but I will assume a L=3 delay for now. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the inflated 'In-transit' count (1161) which includes lost stock. My effective inventory position is much lower. With mean demand at ~106, I need a pipeline of roughly 318-424 units (3-4 periods of demand) to ensure service levels given the volatility.

On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand for the final period (Period 50) is expected to be around the current regime average of ~110-120 units. Looking at the arrival history, recent lead times have been 3 periods (P42 and P43 arrived in P45). This means orders from P44, P45, and P46 are candidates for arrival in Period 49 and P50. Specifically, P44 (130 units) was ordered 5 periods ago and should have arrived, making it potentially lost or significantly delayed; P45 (130 units) was ordered 4 periods ago. If P44 and P45 arrive, we will have 260 units to cover Period 49 and 50. Since this is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 50 or later. Given the extreme reliability issues and the high likelihood that current orders in the effective pipeline (P45-P48) will cover the final period's demand if even one arrives, and that ordering more now creates high holding cost risk for the final period conclude, a quantity of 0 is appropriate to avoid unnecessary inventory at the game's end.",
