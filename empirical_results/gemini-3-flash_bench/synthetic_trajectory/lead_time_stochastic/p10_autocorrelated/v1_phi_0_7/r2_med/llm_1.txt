On-hand is currently 0 and In-transit is 0. Based on the historical average of ~86 units, total demand for 3 periods is approximately 258 units.

The average demand across all concluded game periods (P1-P9) is 124 units. I will use 130 as a baseline forecast to remain cautious. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Actual lead times have been recorded as 1 period (P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). Order from P2 (40 units) and P6 (280 units) are currently overdue/unaccounted for. P6 specifically is concerning (ordered in P6, promised lead time 2, should have arrived in P8 or P9 conclude).

The order from Period 37 (120 units) is now 6 periods old and is confirmed lost. Because on-hand is 0 and the next potentially arriving order (P40 or P41) is not guaranteed to arrive this period (given the 1-3 period lead time and unreliability), I will order 240 units. This ensures that even if one future shipment is lost, the pipeline remains dense enough to prevent prolonged stockouts during the final periods of the game.",

Inventory is currently depleted (0 on-hand), and the supplier is highly unreliable (~40% loss rate). Examining the pipeline (1880 total in-transit): we must discount orders that are 4+ periods old as 'lost' based on historical data where max lead time is 3. The P1, P2, P6, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, and P37 orders are confirmed lost. The 'active' pipeline consists of orders from P41 (120), P42 (240), and P43 (240). The P40 order (120 units) arrived in P43 (LT=3). I expect P41 (120 units) to arrive in P44 or P45. To prevent stockouts given the zero inventory and the high probability that any single future order might fail, I will maintain a frequent ordering pattern.

Supplier reliability remains a major constraint; historically, approximately 40% of orders are lost, and lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' pipeline is 1890 units, but the vast majority of this consists of confirmed lost orders (P1, P2, P6, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, P37). The 'Active' reliable pipeline includes orders from Period 42 (240 units), Period 43 (240 units), and Period 44 (130 units). The P42 order is now 3 periods old; based on historical observations, if it does not arrive during Period 45, it is at extremely high risk of being lost. To protect against a total stockout in Period 46-47 given the 0 on-hand balance and high loss rate, I will place an order of 120 units.

Supplier reliability remains a major factor; historically, approximately 40% of orders are lost. However, the pipeline is currently very full with 1530 units in-transit, though most of these are the 'lost' legacy orders (P1, P2, P6, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, P37). The 'active' and reliable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130) and P45 (120). Given the high on-hand stock which covers approximately 3 periods of demand, and the remaining game length (only 5 periods left including the current decision), the primary risk is now holding cost rather than stockout. We must avoid over-ordering as the game approaches conclusion (P50), as ending inventory is penalized by holding costs.

Inventory is high (243 on-hand) following the arrival of bulk orders from P42 and P43 totaling 480 units. The supplier's unreliability remains the central challenge; approximately 40% of orders are lost, and lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. In-transit inventory is listed as 1650, but much of this is 'zombie' pipeline from historically lost orders (P1, P2, P6, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, P37). The 'real' active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130), P45 (120), and P46 (120). Given the high current stock and the remaining 4 periods in the game (P47-P50), the goal is to prevent stockouts caused by potential losses of the P44-P46 shipments while avoiding excessive end-of-game holding costs ($1.0/unit). Order P44 is 3 periods old (maximum lead time) and should arrive this period (visible P48).

P46 and P47 are still 'active' pipeline. If we assume a 60% delivery rate, we expect roughly 2 of the 4 active/recent orders to arrive. With 137 on-hand, we cover P48 demand (~115).

Currently, we have 62 units on hand. Orders placed in Period 49 and Period 50 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the game's duration, as the minimum lead time observed is 1 period (arriving in the resolution phase of the next period).

The in-transit pipeline includes orders from Period 44 (130), 45 (120), 46 (120), 47 (120), and 48 (110). Given the high supplier loss rate (~40%), any order older than 3 periods is likely lost (P44). Orders from P46-P48 are the most likely to arrive during P49 or P50. Since no further orders can arrive and satisfy demand before the game ends, and any order placed now would simply contribute to ending inventory (and thus holding cost) after Period 50, the optimal action is to place an order of 0.",
