The product 'chips(Regular)' is a staple snack item with consistent demand, likely susceptible to minor fluctuations but generally stable. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. My goal is to maximize total reward (Profit * Sold - Holding * Inventory). Given a lead time of 2, an order placed now (P1) will arrive during P3. Therefore, I must account for demand in P1, P2, and P3 to avoid stockouts. Based on historical average (~86), I expect demand over the next 3 periods to be roughly 260 units. To maintain a safety buffer and account for initial zero stock, I will place an order to cover this pipeline. Since P1 and P2 demand will result in lost sales (as inventory arrives in P3), my priority is to get stock into the machine as soon as possible.",

My current pipeline (in-transit) is 280 units, which covers this window. However, to account for the Period 1 stockout and build a small safety buffer for the next delivery cycle (Period 5 arrival), I will place a moderate replenishment order now.

Orders from P2 (100 units) and P6 (150 units) are confirmed lost/missing. The current pipeline (In-transit) is 700 units, consisting of orders from P11 (250), P12 (100), P13 (100), and the current Period 14 decision. Looking at the pipeline: The P11 order (250) is now at lead time 3 (ordered P11, arriving during P14, visible P15), and P12 is at lead time 2. Given the stockout for 91 units in P13, I need units to arrive immediately. Summing the expected demand for the L+1 period (3 periods of demand + 1 current = 4 periods) at ~110 units/period equals ~440 units. Current In-transit (excluding the P6 lost order) is 450 units (250+100+100). However, because P11 (250 units) hasn't arrived yet and on-hand is 0, there is a risk of continued stockouts if P11 is also lost. I will order 100 units to maintain the pipeline against future demand and potential losses, while not over-ordering due to the $1.0 holding cost.",

This is a significant increase from the temporary dip seen in P36-P37. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 1230, but based on carry-over insights, 930 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33) are confirmed or highly suspected lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists only of the orders from P40 (130 units) and P41 (170 units), totaling 300 units. Since the lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P34: L=2, P35: L=2, P36: L=1), I need to ensure coverage for approximately 3 periods (current + 2 lead time periods). Target inventory level for 3 periods at 100 units/period + a safety stock of 50 units (due to lead time volatility) is 350 units. With 300 units effectively in-transit and 0 on-hand, an order of 50 units is needed to reach the target coverage.",

Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 350 units (P40: 130, P41: 170, P42: 50).

To cover demand for the next 3 periods (P43, P44, P45) at ~110 units/period, I need roughly 330 units. My effective pipeline is 350 units. However, I have zero on-hand stock and no arrival confirmed in Period 42's conclusion, meaning I am likely to stock out in Period 43.
