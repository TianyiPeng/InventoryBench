Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0. Historical demand over the first 5 periods for chips(Regular) averages 86.4 units (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the mean of the available historical samples to set the demand forecast. With L=2, the system must cover demand for approximately 3 periods (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 107 units based on the initial demand estimate (avg 81). However, Period 1 demand was 124, which is significantly higher than the training samples (avg ~86). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 107 units in transit (expected in Period 3, given a promised lead time of 2). Since we only have 5 historical samples and 1 game period, the sample size is small. The Period 1 demand of 124 suggests the recent demand might be higher than the historical average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the recent samples (including the high Period 1 value) more heavily to ensure the base stock covers this potential upward shift. The lead time remains at the default promised value of 2 as no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first two periods was 124 and 95 (mean=109.5). Looking at the provided historical samples, the demand seems to hover around 80-100 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and Period 2 have not arrived yet. Given the promised lead time is 2, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4), and the order from Period 2 is expected to arrive during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). There are 240 units in transit (107 from P1 + 133 from P2). I will set mu_hat based on the mean of the available historical samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70 are provided in the prompt, plus the observed 124 and 95). The mean of (81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 124, 95) is approx 93. With L=2, the backend calculation (1+L)*mean will be roughly 3*93 = 279. This aligns with covering demand for the lead time plus the current period.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the game history shows: P1 order (107 units) has not arrived yet (arrived=0 in P3 conclude). P2 order (133 units) is expected to arrive in Period 4 and be visible in P5's start. P1's order is potentially delayed. The average demand across P1-P3 is approx 95 units per period. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is being lost, the base stock calculation must account for the lead time plus 1 period (L+1=3). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to let the backend track actual arrivals, and 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand statistics to capture the initial regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1 group (ordered 107) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3). Period 3 group (ordered 65) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). Period 2 group (ordered 133) is currently at 3 periods and has NOT arrived yet (it should have arrived in P4 if L=2, or P5 if L=3). This suggests potential lead time variability or a lost/delayed shipment for Period 2. The promised lead time is 2. The observed lead times are 3 and 1, averaging 2. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [124, 95, 66, 93, 70] (including the Period 5 sample provided in the prompt), averaging 89.6. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (2.0) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent stability. On-hand is 79, in-transit is 156 (includes the missing P2 order of 133 and P4 order of 23). If P2 is lost, we are under-stocked.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) over 5 periods is: 124, 95, 66, 93, 120 (Mean: 99.6, Std: 23). The previous historical data provided in the prompt (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) appears to be a separate sample set; however, I will prioritize the 'Game History' which shows an average demand closer to 100 units/period. Lead time visibility: Period 1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), and Period 3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (L=1, L=3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 284 units (Orders from P2, P4, P5). Given the volatility in lead times and consistent demand around 100 units, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed lead times (3 and 1) and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the average of the game history samples (~100 units/period). This targets a coverage of approximately 300 units (L+1=3 periods) to bridge the current stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 423 units. Historical demand (Periods 1-6) has been: 124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113 (average ~102). Looking at lead times: P1 order arrived P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived P4 (L=1). The P2 order (133 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P2, currently P7 start, so L >= 5 periods), suggesting a lost shipment. The P4 order (23 units) is also overdue (L > 2). To stabilize, I'll use L=3 (the only successful long arrival) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the higher late-history variance. I am setting L explicitly to 3 to account for the instability observed, as 'calculate' would be skewed by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 L=3, P3 L=1. P2 order (133 units) and P4 order (23 units) are likely lost as of Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 402 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability (Period 7 saw a spike to 149 units) and consistent stockouts due to lead time instability. Analysis of arrivals: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, and P4 in 3. Crucially, the P2 order (133 units) placed 6 periods ago, P5 order (128 units) placed 3 periods ago, and P6 order (139 units) placed 2 periods ago have not arrived. The P2 order is almost certainly lost. While the promised lead time is 2 periods, the observed median/mode arrival time is 3 periods. To prevent chronic stockouts, I am explicitly setting L=3. I will use a conservative demand estimate (mu_hat) based on the last 5 samples (avg: 111.4 * (1+3) = 445.6) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand seen in Period 7 and the observed delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time mode shifted to 3 periods (observed P1, P4). Order from P2 (ordered 6 periods ago) confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability and inventory instability for chips(Regular). Analysis of concluded periods shows actual lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. The Promised Lead Time is 2, but the modal observed lead time is 3 (Periods 1, 4, and 5). Note that the order from Period 2 (133 units) is 7 periods old and undeniably lost, while the order from Period 6 (139 units) is in its 3rd period of transit and should arrive in the Period 9 resolution phase (visible in Period 10). Demand has increased recently: late-history samples (Periods 5-8) average ~125 units compared to the early-history mean of ~90. To account for the frequent 3-period lead time and recent demand surge, I am setting L=3 explicitly. This effectively increases the target pipeline inventory to cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand average observed since Period 5 (~125/period), and sigma_hat uses recent_N=4 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~90 to ~125 units starting Period 5 (+38%). Lead time mode is 3 periods despite a promise of 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Looking at historical movement, demand shifted starting in Period 5. The mean of Period 5 to 9 is 120.2 units/period, compared to the initial ~90. Lead times are highly volatile, swinging between 1 period (P3, P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), with a promised lead time of 2. I will set L=3 (explicit) to be conservative and prevent stockouts during these longer arrival periods, as being out of stock results in full demand loss ($4 profit per unit vs $1 holding cost). For demand, I'll use recent_N=5 (Periods 5-9) to capture the higher mean and variance seen recently. The in-transit pipeline (424 units) contains orders from P6 (139 units, likely lost or severely delayed since it's 4 periods late) and P9 (152 units). By setting L=3, the target inventory (base stock) will cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand, which is appropriate for the current volatility and service level requirements.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high, bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods. Order from Period 6 (139 units) is now 4 periods late and presumed lost, joining the lost order from Period 2.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at zero on-hand inventory. History shows a severe reliability problem with deliveries. The order from Period 2 (ordered 9 periods ago) and Period 6 (ordered 5 periods ago) are confirmed lost, as their lead times (promised 2) have far exceeded any plausible delay observed. Actual delivery history displays a bimodal lead time of either 1 period (P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), suggesting an average actual lead time closer to 2, but with high variance. Currently, 511 units are 'In-transit', but this includes the lost orders from P2 (133 units) and P6 (139 units). Effective pipeline inventory is therefore 511 - 133 - 139 = 239 units (from P9 and P10). Demand has shifted upwards since Period 5, averaging ~120 units per period. To account for the 3rd-period delivery mode and the risk of lost shipments, I will set L to 3. For demand, I will use the last 6 periods (P5-P10) to capture the higher regime. This settings will trigger a higher inventory target to recover from the current stockout and buffer against lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed for Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units); 'In-transit' count is inflated by 272 units. Lead time is inconsistently 1 or 3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a history of stockouts and inconsistent lead times. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed values are 1 or 3 periods. Crucially, orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 272 units. These represent 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (In-transit: 513). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must use an 'explicit' L to account for the risk of 3-period arrivals and an 'explicit' mu_hat. For mu_hat, I will base the forecast on the high-demand regime (Periods 5-11 avg \u2248 122 units/period). Base stock should ideally cover (L+1) periods, but since 272 units are lost, I will provide a mu_hat that effectively ignores those lost units. Target base stock for L=3 should be around 122 * 4 = 488. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (In-transit - lost). Since the backend doesn't know about 'lost', I will target a base stock that offsets the 272 ghost units. Targeted base stock = 488 + 272 = 760. Setting mu_hat to 760 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the volatility of lead times and demand (std dev of demand ~15-20 across 4 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw arrivals from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), helping clear some backlog. However, orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) are significantly delayed (11 and 7 periods respectively) and must be treated as lost. The current 'In-transit' of 514 units is heavily inflated by these 272 lost units, leaving an effective pipeline of 242 units (mostly from the large Period 12 order). The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level (mean ~120) since Period 5. Given the lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the longer end of the delivery spectrum. Since the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes the lost units, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to manually compensate for the 272 phantom units in the pipeline. I calculate mu_hat for (L+1)=4 periods using a mean of 120 (4*120=480) and then add 272 to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount, resulting in mu_hat=752. Sigma_hat is calculated for 4 periods based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: In-transit inventory is inflated by 272 units due to lost shipments from Period 2 (133) and Period 6 (139). Effective lead time is volatile but frequently reaches 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime. Since Period 5, the mean demand is approximately 116 units per period (last 9 periods range from 92 to 149). The lead time is volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed for P1, P4, P5, P9) or 1 period (P3, P7, P8), which is longer on average than the promised 2. A critical issue is that 'In-transit' inventory (650 units) is significantly inflated by lost shipments: orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 272 'phantom' units. To account for this, I must set 'L' to 3 to reflect the realistic worst-case lead time. I will use 'explicit' for 'mu_hat' to counteract the OR engine's use of 'pipeline' (on-hand + in-transit). By calculating a base stock level (target) and adding the 272 units that the engine *thinks* are coming but are not, I ensure the order placed covers the gap. Target base stock for L=3 (4 periods of demand) is ~464 units (116 * 4). Adjusted target = 464 + 272 = 736 units. With 'sigma_hat', I will use the last 9 samples to capture the increased variance of the new regime.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, averaging ~105 units over the last 10 periods, though the last two periods (92, 61) suggest a potential slight cooling or local fluctuation. The critical issue remains supply reliability and pipeline inflation. As documented in carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) are confirmed lost, inflating the current 716-unit 'In-transit' figure by 272 units. Effectively, the active pipeline is only 444 units. Actual lead times since Period 10 have been 2 periods (P10) or 3 periods (P11). To account for the 'lost' units in the pipeline that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline), I must increase mu_hat (the target base stock) to compensate for those 272 phantom units. Using L=3 (most conservative observed lead time) to determine the coverage window. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + phantom units. Mean is ~105. Window is 4 periods. 4*105 + 272 = 420 + 272 = 692. I will set mu_hat to 692 to ensure an order is triggered despite the ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 162 units on-hand and 491 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from carry-over insights confirms that 272 units in-transit are lost (133 from P2 and 139 from P6). The adjusted pipeline inventory is actually 219 units (491 - 272). These 219 units consist of orders from P13 (136), P14 (68), and P15 (15). Since lead times consistently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3), and the P12 order just arrived in P15 (L=3), it is prudent to set L=3 via the 'explicit' method to account for this recurring delay and protect against stockouts. Demand analysis shows a potential cooling off from the P5-P11 peak (~125), with the last four periods (P12-P15) averaging 82.5 units. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this more recent, lower volume, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat (recent_N, N=11) to account for the overall volatility observed since the regime shift at P5.

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to have stabilized or decreased since Period 12, averaging ~83 units compared to the previous ~125 peak. In-transit inventory remains permanently inflated by 272 units due to lost orders from P2 and P6.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand has shifted toward a lower, more stable regime (averaging ~83 units since Period 12). Lead times are highly variable, often taking 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13 all show 3-period actuals). I am setting L to 3 to reflect this repeated observed reality. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent stabilization at lower levels, avoiding the prior high-demand spike. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' count of 355: based on historical evidence, 272 of these units are lost shipments from P2 (133) and P6 (139). Because the OR backend uses pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see a surplus of 272 units and stop ordering. To circumvent this, I set L=3 and provide an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the desired inventory level plus the 272-unit phantom inventory. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand = 4*83 = 332. To force the backend to order, I must supply a mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - (On-hand + In-transit)' results in the desired order. Current view: 332 (target) + 272 (inflation) = 604. This ensures the backend maintains a high enough stock level despite the lost orders trapped in the 'In-transit' accounting.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand in Period 17 spiked to 122 units after several periods of lower demand (averaging ~83 units). This volatility suggests that while demand has generally cooled from its Period 5-11 peak (~125), it remains unpredictable. We are currently holding 172 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory (336 units) is heavily inflated by 272 units from confirmed lost orders in Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units); effective in-transit inventory is therefore only 64 units (336 - 272). Lead times have consistently been 3 periods for most recent arrivals (P12, P13, P14), despite a promised L=2. To account for the lost stock and the longer actual lead time, I am setting L explicitly to 3. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples (Period 12-17) to capture the lower post-peak demand while accounting for the recent spike, which provides a mean of ~87.3 units per period (multiplied by 1+L for the backend logic). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent period to reflect the current volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we analyze the current state of demand and supply. Historical data shows a demand regime shift around Period 12, where demand decreased from a peak average of ~125 units to a more stable ~83-100 units (the last 5 periods average is ~88). For the lead time, looking at the history of 'Period X conclude' messages, arrivals consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods (Period 13 arrived Period 16, Period 14 arrived Period 17). Although the backend assumes a promised lead time of 2, setting L=3 explicitly is more reflective of the consistent delivery pattern. Regarding inventory, there are two 'phantom' shipments from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) that are lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 336 units. The real in-transit amount is 336 - 272 = 64 units (orders from P15, P17). To force the OR backend to place an order that compensates for these 272 missing units, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. The calculation is: Demand for (L+1) periods = 4 * 90 (recent mean) = 360 units. Adding the 272 lost units to the base stock target effectively offsets the inflated in-transit value, resulting in a mu_hat of 632. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to capture the volatility of the most recent stabilized demand regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been exceeding supply, leading to stockouts. Analyzing the historical arrivals: the effective lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in arrivals from orders placed in P11, P12, P13, and P14). I will set L to 3 explicitly. Demand analysis shows a volatile pattern: Periods 5-11 averaged ~125, but Periods 12-19 have slowed to an average of ~89 units. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this recent lower demand average while maintaining enough stock to cover the 3-period lead time. Importantly, the 'In-transit' figure of 529 is heavily inflated by lost orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units), totaling 272 units. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the order size; by setting L=3, I am instructing the backend to expect a longer window, but the inflated pipeline (due to lost units) would normally cause it to under-order. To compensate for the 272 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively adds these lost units back into the target stock level. Target Base Stock = (1 + L) * Forecast. Recent Avg ~89. (1+3)*89 = 356. To offset the 272 ghost units, I set mu_hat = 356 + 272 = 628.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 12 at ~89 units/period. The pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 272 units (Lost P2: 133, P6: 139).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 21. Demand has stabilized post-Period 12, with an average of approximately 89 units per period (N=9, P12-P20). The actual lead time (L) is consistently observed as 3 periods (evident in P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P15, P16, P17), though it fluctuates occasionally to 1. Using L=3 is safer for coverage. A major issue is the 'In-transit' figure: 662 units are listed, but 272 of these are from lost orders in P2 (133 units) and P6 (139 units). The effective pipeline is actually 390 units (662 - 272). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects (1 + L) times current demand plus the lost units offset. With L=3, we need to cover 4 periods. 89 * 4 = 356. Adding the 272 units of 'phantom' stock gives 628 units. To maintain safety against the current stockout (On-hand: 0), I will set mu_hat to 660. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (approx sqrt(4)*25) to account for demand volatility and lead time inconsistency.

Historical data confirms a permanent inflation of 272 units in 'In-transit' inventory due to lost shipments from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units). The OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will severely under-order if it counts these ghosts as real incoming stock. To correct this, I am setting L to 3 (the observed mode and upper bound of actual lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. Since Period 12, demand has averaged ~89 units. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + L) * average_demand = 4 * 89 = 356 units. However, I must manually offset the 272 units of phantom inventory to ensure the backend places an order. By providing a mu_hat of 628 (356 + 272), the backend's subtraction of 272 phantom units will effectively net back to 356, targeting a 4-period demand window. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility, scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is approximately 60.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) are lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 703 units is inflated by 272 units. The real pipeline inventory is 431 units. Actual lead times have stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals P12, P13, P14). Demand has shifted since Period 12, averaging approximately 89 units per period. To account for the stockout and the 3-period lead time, the OR backend needs to target a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1). I will set L explicitly to 3 to match observed logic and use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the post-shift stability. I am using 'explicit' for L to bypass the promised lead time of 2, as the backend needs the longer horizon to order enough units to clear the current deficit created by the phantom in-transit inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is experiencing significant supply chain issues. First, the pipeline inventory is permanently inflated by 272 units due to lost shipments in Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units). These units will never arrive but are counted in the 'In-transit' total, causing the OR backend to under-order unless adjusted. Second, although the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead time is predominantly 3 periods (evident in P12, P14, P15, P16, P17, P20, and P23). Demand has stabilized since Period 12, averaging approximately 89 units per period (P13-P23 mean is 89.6). To compensate for the 272 ghost units in the pipeline and a lead time of 3, I am using the 'explicit' method. For L, I set it to 3 based on the modal arrival time. For mu_hat, the target is (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=3 and mean=90, the requirement is (4*90) + 272 = 632. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=12 to reflect the volatility in the current stable period since P12, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover the 3-period lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 13-24) shows stabilization at a lower mean compared to the peak around Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 93 units/period, down from the previous high of ~125. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and Period 24 demand outstripped supply. Lead times continue to be volatile but primarily settle at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful deliveries from P20, P21). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 599 units includes 272 units of confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (133) and Period 6 (139). These will never arrive and must be compensated for by increasing the target stock levels, as the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from its order calculation. I am setting L to 3 periods to align with the dominant delivery pattern and using recent_N for demand to capture the current stable state of ~93 units/period. To offset the 272 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to (1 + L) * Mean + Lost_Units = (1 + 3) * 93 + 272 = 644.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a reported in-transit of 676 units. However, consistent history (captured in carry-over insights since Period 10) confirms that the shipment from Period 2 (133 units) and Period 6 (139 units) are lost. This results in a permanent 272-unit inflation of the 'In-transit' figure, meaning \u2018active\u2019 pipeline inventory is 404 units (676 - 272). Furthermore, our Period 15/19 orders (15 and 193 units respectively) are long overdue (11 and 7 periods since ordering), suggesting they may also be lost, although not yet confirmed. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 12, with the last 14 samples averaging ~92 units per period. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts. To account for the 'lost' pipeline units (272 proven + potential losses in P15/P19), I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock and an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L)*105. This slightly elevated mu_hat (relative to the recent mean of 92) compensates for the OR engine's tendency to under-order when it mistakenly believes the 272 lost units are still arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed lost shipments from P2 (133) and P6 (139) total 272 units. Orders from P15 (15 units) and P19 (193 units) are now highly likely lost as well (7+ periods since ordering). Pipeline inventory is significantly ghost-inflated.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Post-Period 12) is stable, averaging 91.5 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of lost shipments inflating the 'In-transit' figure, which prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. Current In-transit is 676 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193). Total lost = 480 units. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory = In-transit + On-hand'. To ensure the backend orders enough to meet demand, the L and mu_hat parameters must be adjusted to 'hide' this ghost inventory. Since Lead Time (L) is consistently around 3 periods, I set L to 3. Expected demand over (L+1) periods (4 periods) is approximately 366. However, with 676 in-transit (where ~480 is ghost), the backend sees 676 against a base stock. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the 'In-transit' plus safety stock. I am using the 'explicit' method for L to account for the consistent 3-period arrival. mu_hat is set significantly higher than actual demand to compensate for the 480 units of ghost inventory that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders) totals 480 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and a massive inflated 'In-transit' figure of 876 units. Based on history, we have confirmed lost orders from P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), and P19 (193), totaling 480 'ghost' units. Furthermore, the orders from P17 (49 units, 11 periods ago) and P24 (70 units, 4 periods ago) are now highly suspect given the observed lead time mode of 3 periods. If we exclude these and the ghost units, the functional pipeline is much smaller. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 95 units over the last 15 periods (since P13). To force the OR engine to order despite the ghost inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the mode) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 850. This value is calculated as (L+1) * 95 = 380, plus an offset of 480 to account for known ghost units (380 + 480 = 860). This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation perceives a need for a large replenishment order immediately.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders) is confirmed at 480 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193). Potential further losses identified P17 (49) and P24 (70) as they are well past the 3-period lead time mode.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 90-100 units per period. Analysis of the pipeline inventory reveals significant 'ghost' inflation due to lost shipments. Based on historical data: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), and P19 (193) are confirmed lost. Additionally, P17 (49) and P24 (70) are now well past the maximum observed 3-period lead time (being 12 and 5 periods late, respectively) and are also presumed lost. Total lost pipeline inventory = 133+139+15+193+49+70 = 599 units. Real In-transit = 879 - 599 = 280 units. On-hand is currently 0. The system needs to cover at least (L+1) periods of demand. With L commonly at 3, we need to cover 4 periods (approx 400 units). Given real pipeline is 280, the backend needs to order roughly 120 units. To achieve this, I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent 10-period average (~95 units/period) multiplied by (L+1)=4, while using L=3 to reflect the consistent upper-bound lead time.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders) is estimated at 599 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), and P24 (70). Actual demand mean is ~95 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 analysis: Demand remains in a regime averaging approximately 95 units (ranging 85-151 recently). Ghost pipeline inventory is a major concern. The total 'In-transit' of 679 includes confirmed and highly likely lost orders from Periods 2 (133), 6 (139), 15 (15), 17 (49), 19 (193), and 24 (70), totaling 599 units. Real pipeline inventory is therefore 679 - 599 = 80 units (the P25 order of 77 and P28 order of 3). With only 49 units on hand and 80 real units coming, we are undersupplied for the next 3 periods (average lead time L=2-3). To force the OR backend to order, I must set L and mu_hat to values that exceed the current inflated pipeline inventory view. I select 'explicit' for mu_hat based on (1+L) * 95 demand. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 95 = 285. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 679 'In-transit', I must set an explicit mu_hat that is high enough to bypass this logic: Target Base Stock needs to be ~960 to result in an order of ~280 units (approx 3 periods of coverage).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the total 'In-transit' pipeline is 943 units. However, based on the historical record and the 3-period lead time mode, several orders are confirmed lost or extremely overdue: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), and P24 (70), totaling 599 units of 'ghost' inventory. Additionally, the P25 order (77 units) is now 6 periods old and most likely lost. This brings the total estimated ghost inventory to 676 units. Actual functioning pipeline is roughly 943 - 676 = 267 units (the P30 order). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P27-P30) has spiked significantly, averaging ~115 units, compared to the previous regime of ~95. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this surge and use L=3 to account for the frequent shipment delays. The OR engine needs an explicit L and a high mu_hat to overcome the massive ghost pipeline inflation and trigger a necessary order to meet this new demand level.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, estimated ghost inventory (lost shipments) has increased to 676 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), P24 (70), and P25 (77). Demand regime shifted upward at Period 27, now averaging ~115 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are facing an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0) and a significant amount of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Based on history, orders from P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), P24 (70), and P25 (77) are highly likely lost, totaling 676 'ghost' units. The system reports In-transit as 943, but the effective pipeline is only 267 units (the order from P30). Lead times are volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. Demand has shifted upward starting Period 27, averaging ~125 units over the last 5 periods (151, 122, 135, and earlier samples). To compensate for the 676 lost units being incorrectly counted toward the base stock by the OR backend, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 promised + 1 observation delay/buffer) and current demand (~125) to be roughly 125 * (3+1) = 500 units. To force an order despite the 676 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1200 (approx. 500 needed + 700 ghost/safety). I set L to 3 to reflect actual delivery patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 27) averages ~121 units/period (P27-P32: 96, 92, 151, 122, 135, 105). Lead times remain highly volatile, primarily clustering at 3 periods, but with significant shipment losses. Pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1241 units. However, I have identified a massive amount of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed/highly likely lost orders) totaling 676 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), P24 (70), and P25 (77). Adjusting the 'In-transit' figure by subtracting these 676 units results in an effective pipeline of 565 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order that bridges the gap created by these losses and covers the lead time, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=3 based on the observed mode. For mu_hat, I use (1+L)*121 = 484. For sigma_hat, the recent standard deviation is ~22, so sqrt(1+3)*22 = 44. To account for the 676 missing units that the OR backend incorrectly believes are arriving, I add 676 to the mu_hat target (484 + 676 = 1160) to force a replenishment order that compensates for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33, ghost pipeline inventory (lost/severely delayed shipments) is confirmed at 676 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), P24 (70), and P25 (77). Demand regime stabilized at ~121 units/period since Period 27.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 121 units/period since Period 27 (averaging samples from P27-P33). The lead time remains volatile, but recent arrivals show a mix of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 being a conservative operational upper bound to ensure stock availability. A critical factor is the significantly 'ghost' inflated in-transit inventory. As of Period 34, the in-transit view shows 943 units. Based on historical data and extended absence of arrivals, 676 of these units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25). This leaves an effective pipeline of 267 units (ordered in P30). With 179 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 267, the total reliable inventory is 446 units. To protect against the volatile lead time (L=3), the base stock should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~484 units). By setting L=3 and using recent demand trends (N=7), mu_hat will be approximately 484, and sigma_hat will provide the necessary safety buffer for the high service level required (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 121 units/period (P27-P34: 96, 92, 151, 122, 135, 105, 119, 85). However, inventory management is severely complicated by 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived and remain in the 'In-transit' figure. Based on history, orders from P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), P24 (70), and P25 (77) are lost, totaling 676 units. Additionally, the order from P30 (267 units) is now at lead time = 5 periods, which is significantly past the observed mode of 1-3 periods; this order is also presumed lost, bringing total ghost inventory to 943 units. Since 'In-transit' is exactly 943, the actual effective pipeline inventory is 0. With on-hand inventory at 94 units and demand averaging ~120, a stockout is imminent. I will set L to an explicit 3 to reflect the realistic upper limit of the volatile lead time (which varies between 1 and 3 periods). mu_hat is set to (1+3)*121 = 484 to cover the lead time and the current period. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility during this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, ghost pipeline inventory is confirmed at 943 units: P2 (133), P6 (139), P15 (15), P19 (193), P17 (49), P24 (70), P25 (77), and P30 (267). Effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand regime remains stable at ~121 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 35 periods, the supply chain has been plagued by lost shipments. As of Period 36, I have identified a cumulative 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 943 units consisting of the following suspected lost or severely overdue orders: P2(133), P6(139), P15(15), P19(193), P17(49), P24(70), P25(77), and P30(267). Since the current 'In-transit' status is exactly 943, the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Recent demand has stabilized around ~115-121 units (with a slight dip in the last two periods). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stk. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (observed mode), and mean demand ~115, the target would be roughly 400-500 units. Adding the 'ghost' inventory of 943 to this target ensures the OR engine (which subtracts the 943 in-transit) still emits a positive order to cover future demand.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36, the 'ghost' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost or severely overdue) is 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). Effective pipeline is currently zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift. While the average since Period 27 was ~115-121 units, the last two periods (P35-P36) saw a drop to 87 and 52 units respectively. However, given the overall history, I will treat the mean as approximately 110 units to avoid understocking. The 'In-transit' figure of 1391 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory (lost/severely overdue shipments). Based on carry-over insights, orders from P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, and P30 (totaling 943 units) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P32 (298 units) arrived in P33. The only active, valid order in the pipeline is the P36 order of 448 units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (943 units) from the visible in-transit (1391 units) leaves 448 units, which matches the P36 order. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 448 units. Lead time remains volatile, but mode is 3. I am setting L=3, mu_hat to 440 (reflecting a mean of 110 over L+1 periods), and sigma_hat to 70 to handle volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the ghost inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, ghost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). Effective pipeline inventory consists only of the P36 order (448 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-243.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sharp decline over the last three periods (52, 41), significantly below the previous average of ~121. This suggests a potential regime shift or seasonal drop. Calculating the mean of the last 11 samples (P27-P37) gives ~103, but the most recent 5 samples average ~77. Given the current high on-hand inventory of 407 units following the arrival of the P36 order, we are overstocked relative to current demand. The ghost pipeline inventory (lost/overdue shipments) is confirmed at 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30), meaning the backend's 'In-transit' calculation is completely offset by these losses. Effective pipeline is zero. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=11) to balance the recent spike and the current drop, while setting L to explicit 3 to account for the real-world lead time variability observed, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the 4-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Mean demand decreased significantly from ~121 to ~46 over the last two periods (P36-P37). Total ghost pipeline inventory remains at 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly downwards since Period 36. Demand in the last three periods has been 52, 41, and 79, averaging approximately 57 units/period, compared to the previous average of ~121. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this drop and prevent excessive overstocking. The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to safeguard against longer delays. On-hand inventory is currently high (328 units) following the arrival of the Period 36 order. The 'In-transit' figure of 943 units is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30), so the effective pipeline is zero. Using L=3 and recent_N=3 for mu_hat will allow the backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current high on-hand and lower demand, likely resulting in a zero order until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand decreased from ~121 to ~57 units (-53%) based on periods 36-38 history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36-P39) has shown a significant drop to an average of ~69 units, compared to the prior regime of ~121 units. Although the 'chips(Regular)' demand is variable, this downward shift requires a correction in mu_hat to avoid excessive holding costs. The 'ghost' pipeline inventory remains a critical factor: the 'In-transit' figure of 943 units is composed entirely of orders that are confirmed lost or severely overdue (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). The effective pipeline inventory is currently zero, as nothing is arriving from those legacy orders. For Period 40, the on-hand inventory is 224. Given a lead time mode of 3 and the recent demand average, the base stock targets should be calibrated to the new lower regime (~69 units/period). I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods (L+1) at this lower rate to prevent further over-ordering while the system burns through current stock, and I will use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the mode of 3 observed in stable periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined ghost pipeline inventory: 943 units are lost (P2: 133, P6: 139, P15: 15, P19: 193, P17: 49, P24: 70, P25: 77, P30: 267). Effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand regime shift at P36 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~69 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36-P40) has transitioned into a new regime. While the carry-over insight noted a significant drop initially, demand in the last three periods (P38-P40) has rebounded to 79, 104, and 111, suggesting the 'low' was temporary. Averaging the last 5 periods (52, 41, 79, 104, 111) yields ~77 units/period, but looking at the last 3 periods specifically, the average is ~98. I will use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to compute mu_hat to capture the shift without overreacting to the single low of 41. Ghost inventory remains at 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30), and current in-transit (943) equals this ghost amount, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. On-hand is 113. With L typically being 3 and lead time volatility high, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use historical arrival data, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent demand stabilization near 100.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 was less severe than initially thought: following a dip to ~46 units (P36-37), demand rebounded to an average of ~98 units (P38-P40). Total ghost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 943 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is down to 5 units, while demand has recovered from a temporary dip (P36-37) to average 100.2 units over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). Pipeline inventory (943 units) is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30), so the effective pipeline is zero. A new order is required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand stabilizing around 100 units/period. For lead time (L), although the promise is 2, arrivals remain volatile (recent arrivals at L=1 and L=2); I'll set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average while the 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' provide enough stock to cover the typical 2-3 period lead time variability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current demand volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 943 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, all 943 units are 'ghost pipeline' inventory\u2014orders that were lost or are severely overdue (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). Effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. Inventory on-hand is 0 after Period 42. Demand has stabilized following the Period 36 dip; over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 102.4 units (79, 104, 111, 108, 110), indicating a return to a steady state around 100-110 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'ghost' pipeline from the calculated base stock, I must use an 'explicit' L to account for lead-time variability and 'explicit' mu_hat/sigma_hat to ensure a sufficient order is placed to meet upcoming demand and restore safety stock, effectively bypassing the inflated in-transit figure. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~105 units/period over a (3+1) window, and sigma_hat to reflect moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, the ghost pipeline inventory remains 943 units. Demand has fully recovered from the Period 36 dip and is now stable at ~105 units/period (avg of P38-P42 is 102.4).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a temporary dip between Periods 36-39. Since Period 38, demand has averaged approximately 105 units (79, 104, 111, 108, 110, 92). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1321 units is misleading due to substantial 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. As of Period 43, I have confirmed and estimated 943 units are lost (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). The remaining 378 units represent the order placed in Period 43. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1321 - 943 = 378) shows that the pipeline inventory actually contains only that single recent order. Given a volatile lead time that frequently reaches 3 periods, I will set L to 3 and use the recent demand regime (last 6 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover demand while the single active order is in transit, without being suppressed by the ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is defined by zero on-hand inventory and a substantial but largely 'ghost' pipeline. My data analysis indicates that out of the 1,321 units currently in-transit, 943 units are lost from orders placed at Periods 2, 6, 15, 19, 17, 24, 25, and 30. This leaves an effective pipeline of 378 units (from Period 43). Demand has stabilized after the significant dip observed at Period 36; the average demand from Period 38 to 44 is approximately 101 units per period. I will use N=7 for recent demand forecasting to reflect this stable post-dip regime. Given the lead time is promised at 2 but frequently behaves as 1 or 3, I am using an explicit lead time of 2 for calculation purposes. The ghost inventory (943 units) must be compensated for because the OR backend relies on the total in-transit figure (1,321). To ensure the backend places an order that covers the gap, I set mu_hat explicitly to the expected demand across (L+1) periods (approx 303 units) plus the 943 units of lost inventory, totaling 1,246. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the 'missing' 943 units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 45, ghost pipeline inventory remains at 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). Effective demand mean has settled at ~101 units/period since Period 38.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 101 units per period since the dip at Period 36. Recent demand (P38-P45) averages approximately 105. Prior ghost inventory analysis confirms that 943 units in the 'In-transit' field are lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30) and will never arrive. On-hand inventory is currently 241 units. The most recent order from Period 43 (378 units) arrived in Period 45, confirming an actual lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there is 0 'effective' pipeline inventory (excluding the 943 lost units). Since demand is roughly 105 units/period and lead time is 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 315 units). With 241 units on hand and 0 in effective transit, a small replenishment or adjustment via OR parameters is needed. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the post-P36 recovery stability (avg ~105) and recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. L will be set to default as recent arrivals align with the promised 2-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a temporary dip around Period 36. Since Period 38, demand has averaged approximately 113 units per period (113, 108, 110, 92, 104, 137, 145 over P38-P46). The current on-hand inventory is 96 units, and the system reports an in-transit inventory of 943 units. However, based on the historical pattern and 'Carry-over Insights', these 943 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline inventory is 0. To prevent a stockout in Period 48/49, considering the mode lead time is currently around 2-3 periods, I need to order to reach a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised) or 3 (actual mode), I targeted a 4-period coverage (approx 450 units). Since the OR backend uses the 'pipeline_inventory' in its base-stock calculation (inventory_position = on_hand + in_transit), and it sees 943 units in transit, it will not place an order unless I force the 'L' or demand parameters to counteract this 943-unit inflation. However, the 'cap' logic in the OR backend also limits orders. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 'ghost' 943 units, I would typically need to set mu_hat very high to exceed that total; but since I only have 4 periods left in the game (P47-P50), I must be careful not to over-order and incur high holding costs at the end. At Period 47, an order placed now with L=2 will arrive in Period 49. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the current stable demand of ~113 units and use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the persistent 2-3 period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards again. Since Period 45, demand has been 137, 145, and 151, averaging 144.33 units. This is a significant increase from the previous mean of ~101. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' inventory of 943 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since we are at Period 48 and the game ends at Period 50, and the actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods (mode 2-3), any order placed now must cover the remaining periods (48, 49, 50). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the recent demand surge (~145 units/period) and the zero effective pipeline. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*145 = 435. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45: mean increased from ~101 to ~145 (+43%). Ghost pipeline inventory remains 943 units; effective pipeline is zero.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 45, with the mean demand increasing from ~101 to approximately 149 units per period (average of P45-P48 is 149.5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory (943 units from lost orders P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30). Effectively, there is zero units in transit that will actually arrive. The actual lead time has stabilized closer to the promised 2 periods recently (P43 arrived in 2 periods), but history shows frequent 1-3 period variability. Since the game ends at Period 50, and we are at Period 49 decision phase, any order placed now (L=2) will arrive during Period 51 arrival phase (after Demand Resolution of Period 51), which is outside the game's horizon. However, the system requires parameters to function. To address the ghost inventory and the new demand level, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high demand since Period 45, and 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the most recent arrival behavior.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 45: mean demand increased to ~150 units/period. Total ghost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 943 units (P2, P6, P15, P19, P17, P24, P25, P30).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the store has 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 943 units. However, consistent history establishes that all 943 units currently in-transit are 'ghost inventory' (lost or severely overdue orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 24, 25, and 30). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is zero. A demand regime shift occurred at Period 45: the mean demand increased significantly from approximately 101 to 148 units/period (average of P45-P49 is 147.8). Because the backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order size, and it perceives 943 units in-transit, I must set the target base_stock (mu_hat) significantly higher than the actual required level to offset this false pipeline data. With L=2, the base stock normally covers 3 periods of demand (~450 units). To trigger an order despite the 943-unit ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to at least 943 + 450. I will use the 'explicit' method for L to reflect the volatile but often observed 2-period lead time, and 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to manually override the backend's calculation and force an order that accounts for the ghost inventory and the recent demand surge.
