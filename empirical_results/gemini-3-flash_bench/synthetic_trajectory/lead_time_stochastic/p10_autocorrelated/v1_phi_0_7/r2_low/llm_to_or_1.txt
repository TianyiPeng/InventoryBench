Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. There is no historical performance yet besides the provided 5 samples of demand [81, 97, 100, 84, 70]. The mean demand of these samples is 86.4 and the standard deviation is 11.84. Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock to cover the review period plus the lead time (1+L = 3 periods). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (1 / (1+1)), meaning we aim to meet the mean demand. However, the OR backend's inventory policy will calculate the order based on the parameters provided. I will use 'default' methods to start, which will utilize all available demand samples and the promised lead time of 2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an initial order of 107 units based on early estimates, but these units are currently in transit (promised lead time = 2). As a result, 103 units of demand in Period 1 were lost because on-hand inventory was 0. The demand samples for this SKU are: P1=103 (from history message), and previous samples 81, 97, 100, 84, 70. Calculating the mean of these 6 samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 103) gives approximately 89.17. Given L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the available history and 'default' for sigma_hat. The backend will calculate the order needed to reach the target base stock, accounting for the 107 units already in transit.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been: P1=81, P2=97, P3=100 (from stats provided) and the conclude messages for P1 and P2 show demand realized as 103 and 117 respectively. There is a slight upward trend. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in P1 (107 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (viewable at P4). The order placed in P2 (111 units) is expected at P4. To calculate parameters, I will use all 5 provided historical samples (mean ~86.4, std ~12) plus the actual demand seen in P1 and P2 (103, 117) to forecast. Including recent trends, the average demand is roughly 100. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+2)=3 periods of demand (~300). Sigma_hat will be set to handle the observed variability.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (107 units), Period 2 (111 units), and Period 3 (67 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a backlog of unsatisfied demand (all demand has resulted in 0 sales so far). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the samples are 81, 97, 100, 84, 70 (as provided in the historical demand data section), with an average of 86.4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent average, which the OR backend will multiply by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (107 units) not arrived by start of Period 4 (expected at start of Period 3 if L=2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70 (as provided in the header), though the 'conclude' messages show demand of 103, 117, 118, and 152 for Periods 1-4. I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data for actual demand calculation as it reflects the realised environment. Demand appears to be trending upwards (mean approx 122). Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2. However, Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), while Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (L=1). This suggests significant variance in delivery. The Period 2 order (111 units) is still in transit (L is currently at 3 and counting). I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (3 and 1) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand levels (103, 117, 118, 152) and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 order L=3, P3 order L=1. Demand mean shift: initial periods averaged ~110, recent Period 4 reached 152.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing an out-of-stock situation following a stock-out in Period 5 (sold only 22 out of 136 demand). The demand has shifted upward significantly: the first three periods averaged approx. 113, while the last two periods averaged 144 (152 and 136). Lead time variability is also extremely high; although the promised lead time (L) is 2, we have observed actual lead times of 3 periods and 1 period respectively. Period 2's order (111 units) is currently late (5 periods since order 2), while Period 4's order (109 units) and Period 5's order (157 units) are still within or nearing their promised arrival windows. Given the recent demand spike and the stock-out status, I will use a restricted window of recent samples (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean (avg ~135.3) and increased volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to integrate the observed variability of 1 and 3 periods, effectively averaging towards the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean increased from ~113 to ~144 (+27%). Significant lead time volatility confirmed (L=1 and L=3 observed).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand Analysis: Recent demand shows a clear upward trend. Period 4: 152, Period 5: 136, Period 6: 160. The mean of the last 3 periods is 149.3, compared to the earlier Periods 1-3 which averaged 112.7. This confirms the previously noted demand regime shift. Lead Time Analysis: Lead times have been highly volatile (L=3 for the P1 order and L=1 for the P3 order). This variability causes stockouts, as seen in Period 6 where 160 units of demand were lost because no inventory arrived. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0, with 541 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). The order from P2 (111 units) is now at lead_time=4 (overdue by 2 periods), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Parameters: I will use L=2 (promised) as the base but set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed during this high-demand phase. This helps the OR engine set a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout and protect against the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~150 units/period (mean of last 3 periods is 149.3, up from 113). Shipment from Period 2 (111 units) is 2 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we are facing significant supply chain disruption. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: L=3, P3: L=1, P4: L=3). Most critically, the shipment from Period 2 (111 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected P4/P5) and is likely lost. Demand has shifted upward and stabilized around a mean of ~145 units per period over the last 4 periods (P4-P7: 152, 136, 160, 137; avg = 146.25), compared to the earlier mean of ~113. Total units currently in transit (432) include the suspicious P2 shipment (111), meaning the reliable pipeline is only 321 units. To compensate for the lost P2 inventory and ensure we meet the higher demand regime (avg 146), I will set L to 3 to cover the longer realized arrivals, use N=4 for mu_hat to capture the recent regime shift (+29% vs early mean), and adjust sigma_hat to reflect increased demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (111 units) highly likely lost (4 periods since order, 2 periods past maximum observed lead time). Demand regime stabilized around 146 units/period (Periods 4-7).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The current demand regime (Periods 4-8) shows a mean of 139.8, which is a significant increase from the initial three periods (~113). The Period 2 order (111 units) is now 6 periods late and is confirmed as lost based on history showing lead times of 1-3 periods. On-hand inventory is 43 units. In-transit inventory is 428 units, but since the 111 units from Period 2 are lost, the effective pipeline is 317 units (164 from P6, 0 from P7, 153 from P8). Observed lead times have been 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods, averaging 2.5. I will set L to 3 to be safe given the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime (approx 140/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the increased volatility in this new regime. Setting L=3 and mu_hat based on the last 5 periods will calculate a base stock covering 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (111 units) is officially categorized as lost (6 periods since order, max observed L=3).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU shows a stabilization of demand following an earlier regime shift. Demand in the most recent periods (P7-P9) has averaged 114.3 units, compared to the P4-P6 average of 149.3 units. The long-term mean (P1-P9) is 125.4. While the Carry-over Insights noted a higher regime (~150), recent data suggests a moderate cooling or high volatility. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the post-shift behavior while smoothing recent noise. Lead time (L) remains highly volatile, with observed values of 1, 3, 3, 3, 1. The average of observed lead times is 2.2. The shipment from Period 2 (111 units) is officially lost, so the pipeline inventory (364 units) consists of orders from P6, P8 (arrived), and P9. Specifically, the 'In-transit' visible at $P=10$ start likely reflects P6 (164) + P9 (89) + P8 (now arrived, but status updates lag) or similar accounting. The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (promised) with 'calculate' allows the OR engine to use the historical average (2.2), while mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the last 6 periods will account for the higher demand regime compared to the very early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards again. After a peak around Period 4-7 (averaging ~145), the last three periods (P8-P10) have seen demand drop to 114, 92, and 87, averaging 97.6. This looks like a return to the early period levels (P1-P3 avg ~113) or lower. I will set N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent cooling. Regarding lead times, the observed values are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1], averaging 2.2. The shipment from Period 2 (111 units) is officially confirmed lost as it is 8 periods past the order date and the max observed lead time is 3. The current in-transit (402) includes orders from P6 (164), P9 (89), and P10 (38), totaling 291 units. Since total in-transit is 402, it appears there might be a calculation discrepancy or an older order still counted; however, the P6 order is now 5 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed. Given the lower recent demand and high pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand to avoid over-ordering during this dip and set L=2 (promised) to stabilize, as the average is close to 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Mean decreased from ~146 to ~98 (-33%). Shipment from Period 6 (164 units) is now 5 periods old and potentially lost (max observed L=3).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly downwards since Period 8. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 85.25 units, compared to the previous regime of ~146. Period 11 demand dropped further to 48, though this may be a low outlier or downward trend. The shipment from Period 6 (164 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived; given the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, this order is officially considered lost. Total in-transit is currently 402 units, but subtracting the lost P6 shipment (164) leaves an effective pipeline of 238 units (from orders in P9 and P10). With current on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 238, I am choosing N=4 for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand regime, and using 'calculate' for L to account for the observed lead time volatility (range 1 to 3). Parameters are set to manage the lower demand while acknowledging the risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (164 units) is officially categorized as lost (6 periods since order, max observed L=3). Updated demand mean for the new regime (starting P8) is approximately 85 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 8. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand values are 114, 92, 87, 48, and 64, resulting in a mean of 81.0 units. Observed lead times are volatile: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2. The average lead time is approximately 2.3 periods. We have 63 units on-hand and 275 units in-transit (orders from P6 and potentially others). Note: the order from P6 (164 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since order) and is likely lost, which inflates our in-transit figure artificially. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent demand regime (N=5) and using the default lead time (L=2) for calculations to stay conservative. The OR engine will subtract the 'in-transit' 275 from the base stock, potentially resulting in zero new orders if it believes the 275 units are coming. However, given the high stock-out risk if P6 is indeed lost, I am ensuring the parameters reflect the most recent lower demand to avoid over-ordering elsewhere.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower-demand regime that began around Period 8. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is 78.8 units, compared to the previous regime of ~146. In the most recent three periods (P11-P13), demand has further softened to an average of 60 units. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a shipment from Period 6 (164 units) definitively lost as it is now 8 periods old. There are 275 units in-transit (from orders placed in Periods 1-13 that haven't arrived/concluded), but since the P2 and P6 orders are lost, the functional pipeline is likely zero as no orders were placed in P11-P13. The on-hand inventory is 0. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6 samples (N=6) to capture the current lower demand level and use the 'calculate' method for lead time to account for the observed variance (L=1 to L=3).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P8-P13): mean demand decreased to ~79 units/period. Functional pipeline is currently empty due to no orders being placed P11-P13 and previous orders (P2, P6) confirmed lost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards since Period 8. The mean demand for the last five periods (P10-P14) is 65.4 units, significantly lower than the preceding high-demand period (~146 units). We use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new baseline. Regarding lead times, we observe variability (L ranges from 1 to 3); setting L to 'calculate' allows the system to average observed lead times. Notably, the shipment from Period 2 (111 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are officially classified as lost because they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin (12 and 8 periods respectively). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit amount shown (290 units) is misleading because it includes these 275 units of lost stock (111 + 164). The only 'live' order in the pipeline is the 15 units from Period 14. We use these parameters to restock to the new lower demand level while accounting for the lost pipeline inventory which the OR engine would otherwise mistakenly count.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 8. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P8-P15), mean demand is approximately 80.3 units per period (Avg of 114, 92, 87, 48, 64, 68, 60, 84 is 77.1; or the mean of the samples provided in the prompt P1-P5 is 86.4). The most recent 3 periods (P13-P15) show a mean of 70.6. I will use a window of N=8 to capture the current lower regime mean and variance. Lead time observations show high volatility (L ranges from 1 to 3). The order from Period 2 (111 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are confirmed lost. The current in-transit inventory of 290 units seems to include those lost orders; however, the OR backend logic manages orders based on its own internal pipeline tracking. I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect the observed variability where lead times often exceed the promised 2 periods (actuals: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2). Selection: L=recent_N (N=5), mu_hat=recent_N (N=8), sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 8. Analyzing Periods 8-16, the mean demand is approximately 86 units per period (Samples: 114, 92, 87, 48, 64, 68, 60, 84, 89). The standard deviation for this period is approximately 20. Lead times have shown significant volatility, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P3 order L=1, P8 order L=1, P9 order L=3, P10 order L=2). Since the promised lead time is 2, I will use L=2 as the baseline but recognize the high variance. There are currently 290 units in-transit (orders from P14 and potentially previous periods if not yet arrived, though the prompt indicates 290 is total in-transit). Given on-hand is 0, the total pipeline is 290. Using mu_hat based on the recent N=9 samples (86 units/period * 3 periods = 258) and sigma_hat also based on recent variance. This will prevent over-ordering since pipeline (290) > base stock (approx 258 + safety). Correcting for current regime to stabilize inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P8-P16) at approximately 86 units/period. Lead time volatility remains high, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a shift at Period 8. Between Period 8 and Period 17, the average demand is 86.1 units per period. The current demand trend (last 3 periods: 84, 89, 107) shows a slight upward trajectory, but remains within the regime identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time (L) continues to exhibit high volatility, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed and the actual lead time for the most recent arrival) to provide a safety buffer against stockouts. mu_hat is calculated using a window of N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P8-P17) while excluding the previous high-demand period. sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is 0, and we rely on the in-transit pipeline (275 units) which was generated by previous decisions, but since the pipeline is full and the system uses a base-stock policy with a cap, setting conservative estimates ensures we don't over-order if the previous orders (P11-P13 were zero, P14 arrived, P15-P17 were zero) leave gaps.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting from Period 8, averaging approximately 86 units/period (mean of Periods 8-18 is ~83, with individual values between 48 and 114). The current on-hand inventory is 0. There is 326 units in-transit, which accounts for orders placed in Period 18 (51 units) and much older, likely lost orders (Period 2: 111 units, Period 6: 164 units). Since the OR backend uses in-transit units to offset orders, and my Carry-Over Insights confirm Period 2 and Period 6 orders are lost, the 'functional' pipeline is significantly lower than the reported 326. Specifically, 326 - 111 - 164 = 51 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, and to account for the lead time volatility (range 1 to 3 periods), I will set L to recent observations and calculate mu_hat based on the stable demand regime (N=11, covering Periods 8-18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P17-P19) shows a slight upward trend compared to the earlier regime (P8-P16), with demand averaging approximately 107.7 units over the last three periods. The previous regime mean was ~86. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase. Analysis of the lead times shows extreme volatility with values of 1, 2, and 3 periods; the average of the last 10 arrivals is approximately 2.3 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for this historical variance. Currently, there is an order from P18 (51 units) and P2/P6 (111 and 164 units) in transit. However, based on the Carry-Over insights, P2 and P6 orders are confirmed lost. The backend OR calculates the base stock based on pipeline inventory: even if I don't order, the OR sees 'In-transit: 326'. To prevent the OR from under-ordering due to these dead 'ghost' units, I've used N=3 for demand parameters to ensure the targets are responsive to the current 100+ demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shift detected at Period 17: average increased from ~86 to ~108 (+25%) based on last 3 periods (P17-P19).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 17. While the average for Periods 17-19 was ~108, Period 20 showed a drop to 74, possibly indicating high volatility within this new regime or a short-lived spike. The average for the last four periods (P17-P20) is 99.25. Given the high stockout cost (implied by the profit/holding ratio where q=0.5, but units sold are lost revenue), and the current inventory of 0 on-hand, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this updated demand mean (~99). Lead time remains volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is 2.2). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average, which accounts for the frequent 3-period arrivals. The high 'In-transit' quantity of 394 includes several potentially lost shipments (P2, P6, P8 is now 12 periods old), which the OR backend doesn't know are lost. I will set a slightly higher sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the demand volatility seen in the P17-P20 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at P17-P20 shows high volatility (range 74-109) with a mean of 99.3, up from the P8-P16 mean of 82.5.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 17, with an average of approximately 95 units per period over the last 5 periods (P17-P21: 107, 109, 107, 74, 79). Although recent periods (P20-P21) show a slight dip, the elevated mean from P17-P19 suggests a sustained higher level than the previous regime (~80). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 119 (P18: 51 units, P20: 68 units), as the orders from P2 and P6 (total 275 units) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and elapsed time (well beyond the max observed lead time of 3). The OR backend calculates a total in-transit of 394 (51+68+lost 275), so I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the high-end volatility observed, and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current demand environment (approx 95 * 4 = 380). This will signal to the backend that despite the high reported in-transit, the effective stock is low, triggering necessary replenishment orders to satisfy the increased demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 has stabilized around complexly shifting levels, with the most recent five observations (P18-P22) averaging 93.4 units (109, 107, 74, 79, 98). This reflects a slight cooling from the peak of ~108 previously noted, but remains higher than the P8-P16 average of 82.5. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current volatility and level. Regarding logistics, the inventory is currently 0 with 394 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from Period 18 (51 units), Period 20 (68 units), and a significant unrecorded balance (likely from automated OR decisions between P21-P22 not explicitly listed in the 'ordered' history but part of the 'In-transit' total). The Period 18 order (51 units) is now at Period 4 of its lead time (placed P18, not arrived by P22 conclude), which exceeds the max observed lead time of 3 periods. This indicates either a systemic delay or a missing shipment. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times while the OR backend manages the pipeline. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level target is 50%, so the backend will aim to keep inventory lean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P18-P22) at approximately 93 units/period. Shipment from Period 18 (51 units) is 4 periods old and potentially lost or significantly delayed, exceeding previous max L=3.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime starting at Period 18, with the most recent sub-segment (P20-P23) showing a mean of 81.5 units. The shipment from Period 18 (51 units) is now 5 periods overdue and, based on previous history (orders from P2 and P6), it is considered lost. The total in-transit of 326 represents the sum of multiple potential lost shipments (P2, P6, P18) plus recent orders. Accounting for the lost legacy units (326 total in-transit minus 111 (P2), 164 (P6), and 51 (P18) equals 0 units of 'live' in-transit inventory), the pipeline is essentially empty. Observed lead times (L) have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. I will set L to 3 to handle the maximum confirmed delay. Demand forecasting (mu_hat) will target the recent stable regime (N=5 from P19-P23, avg ~86.6) to cover (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 18 (51 units) is officially categorized as lost (5+ periods since order, max observed L=3). Updated demand regime mean (P19-P23) is approximately 87 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a current regime started around Period 19, with demand for the last six periods (P19-P24) being 107, 74, 79, 98, 75, 98, averaging approximately 88.5 units/period. The lead time (L) continues to exhibit high volatility, with observed actual lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and multiple lost shipments (P2, P6, P18). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 347 units, but this includes potentially lost shipments. Calculating functional in-transit: Current In-transit (347) may include the P18 order (51 units), which is officially categorized as lost (7 periods since order). The P24 order (21 units) represents the only reliable recent pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order, and our 'In-transit' is inflated by lost orders (P2, P6, P18), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters. I will choose N=6 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stable regime (P19-P24) and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the consistent variance in this window.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a shift that ended around Period 23. For Periods 19-25, the mean demand is approximately 88.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there are 347 units in transit, this includes several large historical orders (Period 2: 111 units, Period 6: 164 units, Period 18: 51 units) that are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 326 lost units. The functional pipeline is only 21 units (from Period 24). Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the safety stock covers the max observed delay. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the current stable demand mean of ~89 (~356 for L=3). Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the volatility is calculated from this same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P19-P25) at approximately 89 units/period. Functional pipeline inventory corrected to 21 units as older in-transit units (P2, P6, P18) are confirmed lost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 19, with an average of approximately 91 units/period (P19-P26: 107, 74, 79, 98, 75, 98, 80, 114). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity of 350 includes lost units from Periods 2 (111), 6 (164), and 18 (51), totaling 326 units. Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 24 units (Orders from P24 and P26). Lead time continues to be volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will use a conservative estimate for L. I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand of the last 8 periods (~91 units/period) and maintain a sufficient sigma_hat to account for the high demand volatility (standard deviation ~15). The goal is to rebuild inventory while accounting for the significant number of lost units cluttering the 'in-transit' calculation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized after a minor shift around Period 26. Analyzing the recent 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is approximately 94.2 units/period. The most recent demand (P26=114, P27=108) suggests a slightly higher-than-average trend compared to the earlier parts of this window, so I will focus on the last 5 samples (P23-P27) which average 95 units per period. Regarding inventory, 'In-transit' shows 363 units, but according to historical carry-over insights, orders from P2 (111 units), P6 (164 units), and P18 (51 units) are confirmed lost. Total lost units in the pipeline = 111 + 164 + 51 = 326. Functional pipeline inventory = 363 (total) - 326 (lost) = 37 units. These 37 units correspond to P24 (21 units), P26 (3 units), and P27 (13 units). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (L typically 1-3). For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current mean of ~95 units. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent variation around this mean. This configuration allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level against a corrected functional pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units/period since Period 24 (P24-P28 demand: 98, 80, 114, 108, 101; Mean: 100.2). Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1-3 periods. At Period 29, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 360 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P2 (111 units), P6 (164 units), and P18 (51 units), totaling 326 lost units. The functional pipeline consists only of the order from P24 (21 units - now 5 periods old and likely lost), P27 (13 units), and P28 (0 units ordered). Current functional pipeline is effectively near zero. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current 100-unit regime and use explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the history. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the 100 units/period demand and the maximum observed lead time, helping to recover from the stockout state caused by lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 100 units/period (P24-P28 mean: 100.2, up from 89). Older in-transit units from P2, P6, P18, and likely P24 are confirmed or highly probable to be lost shipments, meaning reported 'In-transit' significantly overstates actual future arrivals.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P24-P29) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period (average: 100.2). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 388 units is heavily inflated by several confirmed or highly probable lost shipments: P2 (111), P6 (164), P18 (51), and P24 (21), totaling 347 likely lost units. Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 41 units (from P29). With lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4), and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a 50% service level), I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat correctly captures the current ~100 unit regime. Setting L to 2 (promised) while using the recent demand statistics will trigger an order to replenish the functional pipeline, as (1+2)*100 = 300, and 300 - 41 is significant. This corrects for the lost inventory that the OR backend otherwise assumes is coming.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 24 (21 units) is now 6 periods old and confirmed lost, matching the pattern of older lost shipments (P2, P6, P18). Demand regime remains stable at ~100 units/period (P24-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 100 units/period (mean of P24-P30 = 99.3). The 'In-transit' figure of 388 units is highly misleading because it includes several shipments confirmed or very likely lost: P2 (111), P6 (164), P18 (51), and P24 (21), totaling 347 'ghost' units. Subtracting these, the functional pipeline is only 41 units (from P29). Lead times are volatile (observed 1, 2, and 3 periods). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the 347 lost units will cause it to severely under-order or not order at all. To correct for this, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I forecast demand for the (L+1)=3 periods at 100 units/period, totaling 300. However, to force the backend to place an order despite the 388 units it thinks are in-transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the ghost inventory. To cover 3 meaningful periods of demand (300) while overcoming the 347 lost units, the effective base stock should be ~650. This ensures the backend calculates (650 - 388) = 262 units to order, effectively replenishing the stock and accounting for lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable around 100 units/period since Period 24 (P24-P31 mean: 101.9). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 625 units is highly misleading because it includes several shipments confirmed as lost (P2: 111, P6: 164, P18: 51, P24: 21). Subtracting these lost units (347 total) leaves a functional pipeline of 278 units (mostly from the large order in P31). Lead times remain volatile between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.4 periods. Given the high probability of lost shipments and current zero on-hand stock, I will use recent demand data (N=8, covering the regime since P24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. L is set to 3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time range and ensure the OR backend's inventory position target is sufficient to cover demand while waiting for the next arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period_24 at ~102 units/period. Functional pipeline accounts for lost shipments from P2, P6, P18, and P24 (347 units total).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with a mean of 103.2 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). On-hand inventory is currently 123 units following the arrival of P31's order. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 388 units, but substantial correction is needed for lost shipments. Orders from Period 2 (111), Period 6 (164), Period 18 (51), and Period 24 (21) are confirmed lost, totaling 347 units. Subtracting these from the reported 388 units leaves a functional pipeline of 41 units (the order from Period 29). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with L=1 observed most recently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current stable mean of ~103 units and 'calculate' for lead time to account for the observed volatility. These settings provide the OR engine with the correct recent demand context while maintaining a buffer for the high variance and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline correction: Actual in-transit inventory is 41 units (P29 order). 347 units (from P2, P6, P18, P24) are confirmed lost and must be ignored in pipeline calculations. Demand regime stable at ~103 units/period (P28-P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 24, with a mean of approximately 103 units per period (the average of Periods 28-33 is 107.6, while the broader P24-P33 average is 102.5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 6 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 388 units is highly misleading because it includes 347 units from orders in Periods 2, 6, 18, and 24 which are confirmed lost (exceeding even the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a significant margin). The only functional pipeline unit is the order of 41 units from Period 29, which is now 5 periods old and also likely lost or severely delayed. To ensure stock availability given the current 6 units on-hand and 100+ unit demand, the OR backend must trigger a new order. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the high volatility (1-3 periods). I use mu_hat with recent_N=6 (covering the stable high-demand period P28-P33) to capture the current ~107 unit demand level. I use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Functional pipeline remains at 0 units as the Period 29 order (41 units) is now 5 periods old and categorized as trapped/lost, joining orders from P2, P6, P18, and P24. Total confirmed lost units now reach 388.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 105 units/period (mean of last 7 periods is 105.7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 388 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis and the Carry-Over Insights, these units are effectively lost/trapped shipments (orders from P2, P6, P18, P24, and P29). A shipment from P31 arrived in 1 period, confirming that lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods. With a functional pipeline of 0 and zero on-hand units, a reset/re-stocking order is required. Setting L=calculate (avg ~2.1) and mu_hat based on the recent 7-period stable regime (P28-P34) will target a base stock level that accounts for roughly 3 periods of demand to restore service levels while allowing the backend OR logic to handle the holding cost trade-off.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized at approximately 102 units per period (mean of P24-P35 is 101.6). Orders from Periods 2, 6, 18, 24, and 29 (totaling 388 units) are confirmed lost or trapped, making the actual functional pipeline zero. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2. Currently, there is zero on-hand inventory and the functional pipeline is empty. To restore service levels for the upcoming periods (Lead time + Review), I will set L to a recent average (recent_3) to capture recent variability and mu_hat to reflects the stable regime of ~102 units/period using recent_12. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same recent period to capture the current volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 24-36) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 102 units/period (mean of last 13 periods = 101.4). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 388 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, all of these are confirmed lost (orders from P2, P6, P18, P24, and P29). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. Orders have been skipped for the last 5 periods (P32-P36), leading to current stockouts. To recover, I need to set parameters that assume a lead time of 2-3 periods. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the stabilized mean demand and explicitly set L=2 to reflect the promised lead time while acknowledging the high volatility. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=13 (covering the period since the last regime shift) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for ~102 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed that the reported in-transit of 388 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29). Functional pipeline is 0. Demand remains stable around 102 units/period since Period 24.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 388 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation (Carry-over insights) confirms these are lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 18, 24, and 29. The actual functional pipeline is 0 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 102 units/period since Period 24 (average of P24-P37 is ~101.5). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with L=2 being the promised value. I will set mu_hat based on the stable regime since Period 24 (N=14) and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the observed variance. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed arrival times, though I must manually compensate for the empty functional pipeline caused by lost orders. Since on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is functionally 0, the OR engine will trigger a significant order based on these parameters.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units per period (Periods 24-38). Recent demand in Period 38 spiked to 126, but the overall average over the last 15 periods is consistent. The 'In-transit' figure of 388 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 18, 24, and 29. These units will never arrive and must be ignored. Consequently, the functional pipeline inventory is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent further lost sales in this 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost environment (suggesting a 50% service level target), I must set parameters that trigger an immediate replenishment order. I am using L=3 to account for the maximum observed successful lead time, and mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable regime (~104 units/period) while ignoring older, lower-demand data. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Functional pipeline remains 0 despite 'In-transit' display of 388 units (all confirmed lost). Demand regime stable since P24 at ~104 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized under a regime that began around Period 24, with recent demand (P34-P39) averaging approximately 103 units per period (95, 68, 102, 107, 126, 118). The reported 'In-transit' of 418 units is largely illusory: 388 units (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29) are confirmed lost/trapped, leaving a functional pipeline of only 30 units from the P39 order. With 0 on-hand inventory and the next arrival potentially 1-3 periods away, there is an immediate risk of stockouts. I will set L=3 to account for the upper end of observed lead time volatility and use recent_N=16 for mu_hat to capture the stable regime starting from Period 24. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the most recent periods (std \u2248 20). This approach ensures the base stock calculation targets a high enough level to cover the (L+1) window while correcting for the missing logic regarding lost shipments in the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed that 'In-transit' of 418 units includes 388 lost units (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29). Functional pipeline inventory is only 30 units (P39 order).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 24, with an average demand of approximately 104 units per period (P24-P40 mean: 104.2). The current system-reported 'In-transit' of 388 units is entirely composed of lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 18, 24, and 29. Consequently, the actual functional pipeline is zero. The order placed in Period 39 (30 units) arrived in Period 40 (lead time = 1), but was immediately sold out, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. To maintain a safe stock level that accounts for the observed lead time volatility (range 1 to 3 periods), I will set L to a conservative 'explicit' value of 3. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (3+1)=4 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (spanning the stable regime from P24 to P40) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=17 to capture current volatility. Using the backend's 'explicit' L alongside 'recent_N' demand parameters is the most effective way to bypass the corrupted in-transit data and the default L assumptions.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since approximately Period 24, with demand fluctuating around a mean of 103-104 units per period. The most recent samples (P38-P41: 126, 118, 88, 94) average 106.5, which aligns with this long-term stability. Lead time remains volatile, but recent realized lead times (P31 order L=1, P39 order L=1) show a shift toward shorter arrivals compared to the earlier L=3 occurrences. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 412 is highly misleading. Based on the history of lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29), 388 units are confirmed lost. The actual functional pipeline consists only of the Period 41 order (24 units). With on-hand inventory at 0, we need to order to meet the base stock level for the (L+1) period horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (back to P24) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime and 'calculate' for L to account for the demonstrated lead time variability.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 104 units/period (mean P24-P42: 104.1). Currently, the 'In-transit' quantity is 412 units, but based on historical tracking, 388 of these units are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P18, P24, and P29). A recent order from Period 41 (24 units) is still within the plausible lead-time window (L=1 to 3). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 24 units. With 0 on-hand inventory, the objective is to cover demand for the next L+1 periods. Given the high volatility in lead times (L=1 to L=3) and the risk of lost shipments, I will set L to the promised 2 periods but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure sufficient stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at the current demand rate of 104, while accounting for the 24 functional units in transit. mu_hat = (104 * 3) = 312. sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 15) scaled by sqrt(3).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Functional pipeline consists only of the Period 41 order (24 units). Total historical lost shipments confirmed at 388 units (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29). Demand regime since P24 remains stable with a mean of ~104 units.

Recently, Period 43 demand was 121, and volatility remains present. The reported 'In-transit' of 412 units is deceptive: it includes 388 units from historically lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29) and the Period 41 order of 24 units. Since the P41 order is now at T+2 and hasn't arrived (as of the start of P44), and considering the historical max observed L=3, the functional pipeline is currently 24 units. I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the stable demand regime starting around P24. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (ranging from 1 to 3). The OR backend's inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will use the 412 units, so I must adjust mu_hat to 'explicit' to account for the 388 phantom units. To target a net functional base stock of ~312 (approx (1+2)*104), I need to set mu_hat to 312 + 388 = 700. This compensates for the backend subtracting the lost shipments from the order quantity.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 45 is characterized by a mean of approximately 104 units based on historical stability since Period 24. Recent fluctuations (P42-P44) show demand ranging from 108 to 133, suggesting a slight uptick, but 104 remains the sustainable baseline. The primary challenge remains the reconciliation of 'In-transit' inventory. As of the start of P45, the reported In-transit is 612 units. From historical tracking, 388 units (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29) are confirmed lost/trapped. The order from P41 (24 units) arrived in P44. The order from P44 (224 units) is current and fits within the functional pipeline. Thus, functional pipeline = 224 units. Total units accounted for (On-hand 0 + In-transit 612) minus lost units (388) results in a functional inventory of 224. Given lead time volatility (L=1 to 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average and use an explicit mu_hat of 312 (104 * 3 periods) to ensure coverage through the lead time plus current period, while letting the OR backend balance the service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed functional pipeline is 224 units (Period 44 order). Reported 'In-transit' of 612 includes 388 historical lost units (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29). Remaining 224 units (612 total - 388 lost) matches the P44 order.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has remained relatively stable with a mean of approximately 104 units. The recent Period 44 demand was high (133), but the mean of the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 114.6, slightly higher than the long-term average. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable but slightly drifting mean (~104-106). Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 612 units is heavily skewed by 388 units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29). Subtracting these lost units leaves a functional pipeline of 224 units, which corresponds to the order placed in Period 44. Since promised lead time is 2, this 224-unit order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 47 (visible in Period 47 conclude). With 0 on-hand and a functional pipeline of 224 (covering roughly 2 periods of demand at the current rate), no immediate order is strictly necessary, but the OR engine will determine the exact gap. I chose L=calculate to average the observed lead times (range 1-3).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (re-evaluated from Period 39 to 46) shows a mean of 112.5 units/period (values: 118, 88, 94, 108, 121, 133, 117, 120), indicating a slight upward creep from the previous ~104 baseline. Period 47 starts with 0 on-hand inventory. The reported 'In-transit' of 612 units is highly inflated due to historical lost shipments. Specifically, 388 units (from orders in P2, P6, P18, P24, and P29) are confirmed lost based on excessive delays far exceeding the observed max lead time of 3 periods. The functional pipeline consists solely of the 224 units ordered in Period 44. Since the lead time is volatile (1-3 periods), the Period 44 order (now 3 periods old) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 47. To ensure coverage for the lead time plus one review period (estimated 3-4 periods of demand), and accounting for the expected arrival of 224 units, I will set mu_hat to 450 (approx 4 * 112.5) to maintain a robust base stock. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Mean increased from 104 to 112.5 (+8%) based on last 8 periods. Historical lost shipments total 388 units (P2: 111, P6: 164, P18: 51, P24: 21, P29: 41), which remain in reported In-transit indefinitely.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports 'In-transit' as 612 units, but based on historical analysis and confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29 totaling 388 units), the functional pipeline is 224 units (from the Period 44 order). We are now in Period 48, and the Period 44 order is 4 periods old (L=4). Given historical Lead Time volatility (1-3 periods observed previously, with some orders now reaching L=4+ before being marked lost), an order placed at P44 should arrive imminently or is at risk of being lost. The demand regime from Period 39 onwards has stabilized with a mean of approximately 112.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To manage the end-of-game (ending Period 50) and account for the 224 units likely arriving in the arrival phase of Period 48 or 49, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current demand mean of 112.5 and the high lead-time volatility. Since we are near the end of the simulation, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since the P39 shift) to ensure we cover the remaining two periods without over-ordering and incurring holding costs.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The current demand regime (since Period 39) has a mean of approximately 110.2 units/period (P39-P48 samples: 118, 88, 94, 108, 121, 133, 117, 120, 106, 75). Standard deviation in this regime is roughly 17.5. Lead time variability is significant, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (mode is 3). In-transit inventory is listed as 612 units, but 388 units are confirmed historical losses (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29). A large order of 224 units was placed in Period 44 and has not arrived as of the end of Period 48 (current age: 4 periods). Given the maximum observed lead time of 3, this shipment is now overdue and at high risk of being lost. On-hand inventory is 0. To protect against the likely loss of the Period 44 shipment and ensure stock for the final two periods (49 and 50), I am setting mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (~110) across a lead time of 2, totaling 330. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (On-hand + In-transit) to calculate orders, and our reported In-transit (612) is dominated by lost units (388) and an overdue shipment (224), the 'functional' pipeline is effectively 0. The parameters are chosen to trigger a sufficient order to cover the remaining game periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Period 44 shipment (224 units) is 4 periods old and past the maximum observed lead time of 3; likely lost. Total highly probable lost units in In-transit: 612 (388 + 224). Functional pipeline is 0.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P39-P49) has shown a slight increase in mean to approximately 112 units/period, but with high variance. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' of 612 units is almost certainly 100% lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2, P6, P18, P24, and P29 (total 388 units) are confirmed lost. The Period 44 order of 224 units is now 5 periods old; since the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, this shipment is also highly likely lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. To reconcile this for the OR engine, I use an explicit L=2 and set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) window. Given the current mean of 112, the expected demand over 3 periods is ~336 units. However, since the engine subtracts the 'In-transit' (612 units) from the calculated base stock, a standard parameter set would result in an order of 0. To force an order that replenishes the stock despite the phantom 'In-transit' units, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock plus the phantom inventory (336 + 612 = 948). This bypasses the pipeline inflation caused by lost orders and ensures units are actually ordered to meet demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Functional pipeline is 0. All 612 units currently in 'In-transit' are confirmed or highly probable lost (P2, P6, P18, P24, P29, and now P44). Demand regime since P39 is ~112 units/period.
