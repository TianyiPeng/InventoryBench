Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead-time performance or concluded arrivals to analyze. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 shows an average of 113.4 units/period, but Period 5 (59) shows a significant drop compared to Periods 1-4 (avg 129.5). Given the lack of on-hand inventory and the 2-period lead time, the strategy is to set parameters based on the full historical sample (N=5) to establish a baseline order that covers the inventory gap and anticipates demand over the next 3 periods (L+1). L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full context of the provided samples while prioritizing the recent trend.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 176 units were ordered with a promised lead time (L) of 2. Looking at 'Period 1 conclude', demand was 88 units. Since on-hand was 0, those 88 units were lost sales, resulting in an ending on-hand of 0. The 176 units are currently in-transit. With L=2, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at Period 4). Historical demand samples show Period 1 (146), P2 (110), P3 (112), P4 (150), and P5 (59). The 'Period 1 conclude' demand of 88 is lower than the initial sample of 146. Given the volatility (std \u2248 36) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level is preferred. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the variability across the provided historical samples while adjusting for the latest known demand from Period 1.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods was: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59 (average ~115). Looking at the game history for P1 and P2, recorded demand was 88 and 79 respectively, which is slightly lower than the initial provided samples, though still within the same range. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals have not yet processed. Promised lead time (L) is 2. According to the mechanics, an order placed in P1 with L=2 should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P3's conclude message (which I will read at the start of P4). Thus, seeing 'arrived=0' in P1 and P2 conclude messages is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or loss. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to weigh the most recent realized demand (88, 79) while the backend uses L=2 for the cycle length (1+L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (176 units) has not yet arrived as of the Period 3 conclude message. With a promised lead time of 2, Period 1's order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 conclude message (which I will see next period). Thus, there is no evidence yet that the lead time has changed from the promised 2. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts (lost sales) for the first 3 periods because no inventory has arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 335 (composed of 176 from P1 and 159 from P2). Demand for the first 5 samples provided in the prompt is 146, 110, 112, 150, 59 (average = 115.4, std = 36.3). I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which will use all available samples to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) period cycle. L is set to default (2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1884.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first completed lead time: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4, indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. Demand over the first 4 periods (P1: 88, P2: 79, P3: 121, P4: 103) has a mean of 97.75. Period 5 demand is provided in the prompt's stats as 59, but we base our parameters on concluded history and expected future needs. Given the lead time is clearly L=3 (confirmed by P4 conclude), I will set L to explicit 3. To handle the demand forecast, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend while accommodating the slight volatility. Pipeline inventory is currently 239 units (Orders from P2 and P4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time was 2, but the only concluded order (Period 1 order arriving in Period 4) confirms an actual lead time of 3 periods. Consequently, I will set L to 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0, which combined with the fact that we've had stockouts (Period 5 sold only 73 out of 111 demand), indicates we need to be aggressive. In-transit inventory is 368 (orders from Periods 2, 4, 5). The Period 2 order (159 units) is expected to arrive this period (P6, L=4 from placement) or next, as it is now at L=4. Demand has been relatively consistent: [88, 79, 121, 103, 111], with a mean of 100.4 and a standard deviation of 16.5. To account for the stockout risk and the confirmed longer lead time, I will use a period-over-period mean based on the full history (N=5) and set L=3 explicitly.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time is 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4). Period 5 verified stockout due to lead time lag.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced a persistent stockout. The confirmed lead time from 'Period 4 conclude' is 3 periods (P1 order arrived in P4), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Orders placed in P2, P4, P5, and P6 are still in transit. Given the lead time L=3, the P2 order (159 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution but was not visible in P6's conclude message, suggesting a potential delay or loss, although it is more likely just at the edge of the 3-period window. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend (P1-P6 demand: 88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent higher demand mean (~109 per period). This will result in a mu_hat of approx 109 * (1+3) = 436.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data for Period 4 and Period 7 confirms an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7). The system is currently in a stockout (ending inventory 0 in Periods 5, 6, and 7) because the OR backend is likely using the promised L=2, failing to account for the extra lag. Current lead-time analysis shows shipments from Period 2 and 3 are missing, which may indicate issues or further delays, but we will explicitly set L=3 to match the observed reality. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~106 units across the first 7 periods. I will set mu_hat explicitly for a 4-period window (L+1) using the historical average of 106 * 4 = 424. Sigma is set using 'recent_N' to capture the variability (std ~18) scaled by sqrt(L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods across multiple cycles (P1->P4, P4->P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1849.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data consistently shows an actual lead time of 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P5 arrived P8). However, the P7 order arrived in P8 (LT=1), suggesting high variability or a correction. Given the previous stability at 3 periods, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Demand over the last 8 periods (88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130, 111, 101) averages approximately 105.5 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this general mean, which is more robust than the initial training samples. mu_hat will represent (1+L)*mean_demand. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. On-hand is 70, with 312 in transit (orders from P2, P6, P8); a lead time estimate of 3 helps account for the pipeline correctly.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: While P1, P4, and P5 orders confirmed LT=3, the P7 order arrived in 1 period, indicating potential instability in delivery times.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a notable shift in b\xe5de demand and lead time. DEMAND: After a period of stability around 100-110 units, Period 9 saw a significant drop to 56 units. While one period isn't a regime shift yet, I need to observe if this trend continues. LEAD TIME: The carry-over insights and recent history show a change from a consistent 3-period lead time (P1, P4, P5) to a much faster 1-period lead time (P7, P8). This suggests the logistics have improved or stabilized at a lower latency. For Period 10, I will set L=1 explicitly to reflect this recent performance, as the backend default is 2. I'm using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (Periods 4-9) to capture the stable demand phase while acknowledging the P9 dip, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility introduced by the P9 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has shifted from 3 periods to 1 period over the last two observed arrivals (P7 and P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at a zero on-hand inventory state following a significant demand spike of 156 units in Period 10, which exceeded the 77 units available. Total historical demand mean is approx 108.5 units/period. The lead time has shown significant instability: originally 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), it shifted to 1 period (P7, P8). However, the order from Period 9 has not arrived (would have arrived in Period 10 if LT=1), and the Period 10 order was for 0 units. This suggests the lead time might be reverting to a longer duration or is simply variable. To be safe, I will set L=3 to ensure sufficient safety stock for a longer window, while using recent_N for demand parameters to capture the higher volatility seen recently (std approx 28-30). I choose N=7 for mu_hat to capture the most recent performance regimes while smoothing out the Period 10 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable: after two instances of 1-period delivery (P7, P8), the P9 order failed to arrive in 1 period, suggesting a shift back toward longer or variable lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Delivery times have been highly unstable: initial orders (P1, P4, P5) took 3 periods, while subsequent orders (P7, P8) arrived in 1 period, followed by Period 9 and Period 10 orders failing to arrive by Period 11 (indicating a return to L>=2 or L=3). Given the promised lead time is 2, and recent data shows a reversion from the 1-period anomaly back towards 3 periods, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the longer possible replenishment cycle and clears the current stockout. Demand has shown high variance recently (P10: 156, P11: 109, P5: 59), so I will use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased volatility and the slightly higher average demand compared to the initial samples. This conservative lead time estimate (L=3) combined with recent demand variance will result in a higher order to buffer against current and future stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P7, P8 arrived in 1 period, but P9-P10 orders have not arrived within 1-2 periods, indicating a return to L=3 or higher variance in delivery.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent delivery history for 'chips(Regular)' confirms high lead-time instability. We observed a shift from L=3 (Periods 1, 4, 5) to L=1 (Periods 7, 8) and now back to L=3 (Period 9 arrived in Period 12). Period 10 and 11 orders (which together with 12 and 13 total 448 in-transit) are still outstanding. Because the most recent arrival (P9) took 3 periods, and the system is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0), I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer lead time horizon. Demand remains relatively stable between 56 and 156. I will use the last 8 samples for demand (excluding the very first few) to capture the current mean more accurately, and an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the return to longer delivery cycles.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reverted to 3 periods: P9 order (placed P9) arrived at the end of P12.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently dealing with high lead-time instability and chronic stockouts. Analysis of the game history shows lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods: P1, P4, P5, and P9 all had LT=3, while P7 and P8 had LT=1. The most recent arrival (P9 order in Period 12) confirms a return to LT=3. Orders from P11, P12, and P13 (totaling 283 units) are currently in-transit and overdue if LT were 2, but expected to arrive in P14 or P15 if LT=3. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory. Given the instability, I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1=4 periods). Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~104 units. Using recent_N=10 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) will capture the current regime while filtering out the very early low-sample noise, aiming to restore stock levels given the observed 3-period delay.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: most recent arrival (P9) confirmed a reversion to LT=3 after a brief period of LT=1. Expecting arrivals for P11-P13 orders between P14-P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1780.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 63 units. The lead time has exhibited significant instability, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. The most recent arrival (P11 order arriving in P14) confirms a 3-period lead time is back in effect. My strategy is to set L to 3 to cover the risk of these longer arrivals. Historical demand shows relative stability with a mean around 104 units. To handle the (L+1) = 4 period window (current period + 3 lead periods), I will use recent demand history (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures that the base stock target accounts for approximately 415-420 units of total pipeline inventory. With 372 units currently in-transit and 63 on-hand, the OR backend will decide if a small top-off order is necessary to maintain service levels while accounting for the high holding cost compared to the potential stockout cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last two major transitions (P9 arrived P12, P11 arrived P14), despite brief earlier anomalies of LT=1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1938.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent delivery history (P11 order arrived in P14, P12 order arrived in P15) confirms a stabilized lead time of L=3 periods after a period of instability. Currently, we are at zero on-hand inventory due to high demand (128) in Period 15 exceeding starting stock. Based on L=3, the orders placed in Periods 13 (84 units) and 15 (96 units) along with the zero-order periods are in transit. Specifically, the P13 order is expected to arrive in Period 16. Demand has been fluctuating but averages approximately 107 units over the last 15 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, we must ensure high service levels while accounting for the extended lead time of 3 periods. I will use L=3 and set mu_hat based on the mean of the entire sample size to smooth out recent high variance, while using all samples for sigma_hat to capture the risk of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last three observed arrivals (P11 arrived P14, P12 arrived P15). Demand remains volatile with a mean of ~107 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1596.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For chips(Regular) at Period 17, the most critical observation is the massive demand spike in Period 16 (263 units), which is more than double the historical average (~107). This suggests a regime shift or a significant calendar-based spike. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing high volatility, the base stock needs to be adjusted. The lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods based on the last four arrivals (P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16). To account for the recent demand surge while acknowledging it might be an outlier, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P12-P16), which includes the outlier but keeps some historical grounding. L will be set explicitly to 3 to override the backend's promised lead time (2) and reflect reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift or spike detected at Period 16: demand surged to 263 units (+145% vs avg). Lead time remains stable at 3 periods (last 4 arrivals confirmed LT=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1729.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, a second consecutive demand spike (223 units following Period 16's 263 units) confirms a significant demand regime shift. The average demand over the last two periods is 243, compared to the previous long-term average of approximately 107. Additionally, the lead time remains highly volatile: after several periods of LT=3, the Period 16 order arrived in just 1 period (LT=1). For safety, I will maintain L=3 explicitly to prevent stockouts during delivery lags while adjusting mu_hat to reflect the new demand regime. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+3) * 243 = 972 to cover the lead time plus current period demand, and increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Avg increased from ~107 to ~243 (+127%). Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (most recent P16 order was LT=1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are reacting to a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 16. Demand has surged from an average of ~107 units to ~243 units (avg of P16-P18: 263, 223, 245). This represents a +127% increase. Simultaneously, on-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to stockouts caused by this unexpected demand spike and lead-time instability. Regarding lead time, we have seen a mix of LT=1 (P16 order arrived P17) and LT=3 (most recent arrivals before that). Because the OR backend needs to cover the current period plus the lead time (L+1), and given the ongoing volatility, I will use L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts during this high-demand phase. For mu_hat, I am choosing the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the new demand level (avg ~243) precisely. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=3 to reflect the higher variance observed during this spike. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) directs the backend to maintain a high service level, which is critical given we are currently stocked out and in-transit inventory needs to be aggressively managed to meet the new demand plateau.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Prior to P16, demand averaged ~107 units; however, the last four periods (P16-P19) show a sustained average of ~237 units (263, 223, 245, 218). This transition warrants setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility. Lead time remains highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P16 arrived in 1 period, but P17 and P18 orders are still in transit). Using an explicit L=3 provides a conservative buffer against this instability, ensuring the base stock level covers enough demand to mitigate frequent stockouts observed recently. The large 'In-transit' quantity (1041) reflects the aggressive ordering in response to the demand spike and previous L=3 delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean increased from ~107 to ~237 (+121%). Lead time is unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a conservative planning lead time of 3.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from ~107 units to ~237 units per period (+121%). The most recent five periods of demand are [263, 223, 245, 218, 247], averaging 239.2. Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed LT for P16 was 1 period, but P17, P18, and P19 orders, placed 2-4 periods ago, have not yet arrived). We have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a large pipeline of 1041 units (P15, P17, P18, P19 orders). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase while accounting for the lead time instability, I will set L=3 explicitly as a safety buffer. For demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 16-20). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current higher volatility accompanying the demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P16-P20) is sustained: average demand is now 239.2 (compared to ~107 previously). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Over the last six periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged approximately 253 units (263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324), a significant increase from the previous mean of ~107. Lead time remains highly unstable, with the most recent arrival (P16 order) arriving in 1 period, while previous orders consistently took 3 periods. The orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 696 units) are currently in-transit and overdue if lead time were 1 or 2 periods. Given the 'arrived=0' status for the last four periods despite massive demand, we are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). To mitigate the risk of stockouts during this high-demand phase while accounting for lead time instability, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficiently long window. For demand, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the new demand regime (253 units/period) and sigma_hat also on recent_N to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~107 to ~253 units (+136%). Lead time remains volatile and unpredictable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 planning assumption.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand for this regime (P16-P22) is approximately 251.3 units (samples: 263, 223, 245, 218, 247, 324, 239). The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there have been no arrivals since Period 17 (P16 order), we are facing a significant stockout. The orders placed in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 22 are still in transit (total 1140 units). We must use a conservative lead time of L=3 to account for the longest observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand to recover from the stockout once shipments arrive. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the news demand regime and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~107 to ~250 units per period. The most recent demand (P23: 248) confirms this elevated regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P22 arrived in 1 period, but orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20 are currently at T+7, T+6, T+5, and T+4 respectively with no arrival, suggesting they are lost or extremely delayed). With 0 inventory on-hand and 1041 units in-transit (many of which are likely lost given they are 2-3x the promised lead time), I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to account for the maximum observed lead time. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (starting P16) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P16-P23) is sustained: average demand is ~250 units. Significant shipment loss/delay suspected: orders from P17-P20 have not arrived within standard 3-period window.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~107 to ~250 units (a 133% increase). The last 9 periods (P16-P24) show sustained high demand (avg = 250.4, std \u2248 30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains highly unstable, fluctuating unpredictably between 1 and 3 periods (P22 arrived in 1, but P17-P21 which total 696 units are still missing, indicating significant delays or lost shipments). Given that 1,112 units are in-transit (covering nearly 4.5 periods of demand at the new rate), and the pipeline includes older, potentially lost orders, I will maintain a conservative Lead Time of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and the risk of continued delays. I am using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture only the new demand regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~107 to ~250 units (mean of P16-P25 is 251.4). Lead time is highly unpredictable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant recent supply chain disruptions: orders from Period 17, 18, 19, and 20 are now 5+ periods overdue and likely lost or severely delayed. This has resulted in a critical on-hand stockout despite 1112 units being in-transit. To address this, I will use a conservative planning lead time of L=3 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the longer observed cycles. I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~251) while discarding the pre-P16 data. Setting L=3 with this high demand and volatility will increase the target base stock to bridge the gap caused by the missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Sustained shipment loss/delay: Orders from P17-P20 are now at least 5 periods old and have not arrived, confirming a breakdown in the standard LT=3 window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a critical failure in the supply chain. Despite an in-transit pipeline of 1112 units, no arrivals occurred in Periods 24, 25, or 26. Orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 are now significantly overdue (7-9 periods old), confirming the 'sustained shipment loss' identified in previous insights. Furthermore, demand dropped significantly in Period 26 to 119, down from the ~250 average during the P16-P25 regime. This could be a new demand regime or a temporary dip. Given that the pipeline (1112 units) is already 4-5x the expected (L+1) demand coverage (approx 250 * 2 = 500) and shipments are clearly stuck or lost, adding more to the pipeline is counterproductive while on-hand is 0. I will maintain a planning L of 3 to account for the instability, and use recent_N (N=11) for demand to capture the high-regime period (P16-26) while incorporating the most recent dip. The OR backend will likely zero out these orders because pipeline > base_stock, which is appropriate until arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Massive supply chain breakdown confirmed. Pipeline inventory (1112) is stagnant with zero arrivals for 3 consecutive periods; orders from P17-P20 (over 6 periods old) are likely lost. Period 26 demand (119) signals a potential end to the high-demand regime (avg ~250) observed P16-P25.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 with a massive supply chain disruption. Pipeline inventory (1118 units) consists of orders from P17-P20, P24, and P27. Orders from P17-P20 are now 8-11 periods old, well beyond the standard LT=1-3, and must be considered lost. Recent arrivals (P22) followed an LT=1 pattern, but P24 (LT=4 so far) and P27 are pending. Demand significantly dropped in P26-P27 (avg ~127) compared to the P16-P25 peak (avg ~250), signaling a regime shift back toward baseline levels (~107). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this lower demand regime. For L, although the promised lead time is 2 and recent physical arrivals were LT=1 or LT=3, the current stagnation and suspected order losses make the effective lead time high. Setting L=3 reflects a conservative planning window to account for these delays, while higher values would further inflate the already large (but likely non-existent) pipeline inventory and prevent the OR backend from ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime has shifted down from ~250 (P16-P25) to ~127 (P26-P27). Massive pipeline stagnation continues: orders P17-P20 are lost (11+ periods old).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a critical logistics breakdown alongside a demand regime shift. Demand has dropped from ~250 units (P16-P25) to ~121 units (P26-P28), signifying a clear downward regime shift. Supply is stalled: orders from P17-P21 and P24-P25 (totaling ~1112 units) are significantly delayed or lost (orders from P17 are now 12 periods old). On-hand inventory is 0. While the pipeline inventory is technically high (1118), the OR backend assumes these will arrive. To force a new order to bypass the 'stuck' pipeline, I am setting L to 1 (the minimum possible for future arrivals) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to account for the new lower demand regime (~120 units/period). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the P26-P28 data. L is set to explicit 1 to signal that any new order placed should arrive immediately if the logistics blockage clears, while the carry-over captures the reality of the loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26; average demand decreased from ~250 to ~121 (-52%). Pipeline inventory of 1112 units (orders P17-P25) is confirmed lost/stagnant after 12+ periods of no arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has undergone a sustained shift downward starting at Period 26. While Periods 16-25 averaged ~250 units, demand from Period 26-29 has averaged 123 units (119, 135, 110, 128). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this lower regime. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1112 units consists entirely of orders placed between P17 and P25 that are currently between 5 and 13 periods old. Given that the typical lead time has been 1-3 periods, these units are confirmed as lost or indefinitely stagnant and should not be relied upon to satisfy future demand. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock' to determine the order size; if I leave 'In-transit' at 1112 while demand is only ~123/period, the backend will never place another order. To force replenishment for the current demand regime despite the phantom in-transit stock, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate a base stock for L=2 (promised) plus the current period (L+1=3) at 3 * 123 = 369. To bypass the 1112 'In-transit' units and trigger an order, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline: 1112 + 400 = 1512. L is set to calculated to reflect the actual historical average.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain breakdown for P17-P25 orders is absolute; 1112 units are confirmed lost/stagnant (13 periods since P17). Mu_hat must be artificially inflated to 'bypass' this phantom pipeline inventory in the OR calculation until the backend recalibrates.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. We have a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 1546 units stemming from orders placed between Periods 17 and 30 (except for the tiny P27 order), none of which have arrived despite lead times ranging from 3 to 14 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline' from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed the phantom inventory. Current demand has stabilized in a new lower regime (avg ~131 units over P26-P30). To force an order and bypass the 1546 units of stuck inventory, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 2000. This is a technical override to ensure the system actually triggers a shipment. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the conservative planning requirement, even though the supply chain is currently non-functional. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 50 to cover the recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total supply chain breakdown; pipeline inventory (1546 units) is effectively lost/stagnant. Mu_hat must be set >1546 to trigger any new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic breakdown. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 2083) currently includes orders from Periods 17-25, 27, 30, and 31. Orders from P17-P25 are extremely overdue (7-14 periods) and effectively lost. The demand regime shifted down at Period 26, stabilizing at an average of ~120 units (P26-P31: 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79). Because the OR backend subtracts the massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory (2083 units) from the calculated base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set to exceed the current pipeline. Last period I set mu_hat high to trigger a replenishment; however, no arrival occurred in Period 31. I will maintain an extremely high explicit mu_hat of 2800 (sufficient to cover the 2083 lost units plus a buffer for new stock) and set L=3 as a conservative planning lead time. This will force the OR engine to order enough units to bypass the stagnant pipeline and restore actual availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Pipeline inventory (2083 units) remains stagnant; orders from P17-P25 (totaling 1112 units) are confirmed lost. Recent arrivals (only P27 order for 6 units arrived in P29) suggest a possible L=2, but the broader breakdown necessitates a conservative L=3 for planning.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the arrival of the P31 order (537 units) in Period 32 (LT=1). However, a massive volume of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (approximately 1547 units from P15-P25 and earlier) remains stagnant and is likely lost. The OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculation, which would prevent new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this dead inventory. Demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 121 units. I am setting mu_hat to 3500 to 'bypass' the 2284 units in-transit and ensure a base stock level that triggers replenishment for current demand. I will use L=3 to remain conservative given the high historical variability, and an explicit sigma_hat of 100 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery initiated: P31 order arrived in P32 (LT=1). However, 1547+ units of historical pipeline inventory remain stagnant/lost. Explicit mu_hat inflation is required to bypass this inventory in OR calculations.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with recent orders arriving very quickly (LT=1 for P31 and P32 orders). However, a total of 2516 units are listed as 'in-transit', but the vast majority (approximately 1546 units from P17-P30) are effectively stagnant/lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1046 units due to recent large arrivals. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime (P26-P33) with an average of approximately 118 units per period, down from the previous peak of 250. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive 'phantom' pipeline as reasons not to order, yet also avoiding over-ordering while on-hand inventory is high (1046 units vs ~118 demand), I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime and account for the high on-hand stock. Given L=1 is the most recent observation, L=3 remains the safer planning assumption due to historical volatility. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to roughly (1+L)*mean_demand plus a buffer to ensure the system remains responsive but doesn't trigger massive orders while current stock is sufficient for ~8 periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed for new orders: L=1 observed for P31 and P32 arrivals. Stagnant pipeline inventory (P17-P30) persists at ~1546 units. Demand regime stable at mean ~118 units since P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $914.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has clearly bifurcated into two patterns: a massive 'phantom' pipeline of 1,546 units from orders placed during the Period 17-25 breakdown (none of which have arrived after 10+ periods) and a 'new' operational pipeline with L=1 (confirmed by Period 31 and 32 orders). Current on-hand inventory is 948 units, which is ample for the current demand regime (~118 units/period). However, the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be paralyzed by the 2,516 units 'in-transit', preventing any new orders even if lead times are short. To manage this during this recovery phase, I will continue to assume L=1 for lead time based on the most recent successful arrivals. For demand, the regime has been stable since Period 26 with a mean of ~118. To ensure the backend can place orders in future periods if needed (despite the phantom inventory), mu_hat must theoretically bridge the gap, though with 948 units on hand, no order is required this period. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 samples (since Period 26) to reflect the current lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1672.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized for new orders with a lead time (L) of approximately 1 period (P31 and P32 arrived in 1 period). However, there is a significant volume of stagnant 'phantom' pipeline inventory (approx. 1546 units from P17-P30) that has not arrived for 5-18 periods and is effectively lost. The OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock. If I set mu_hat based on actual demand (~118 units), the backend will see 2516 units in-transit and place zero orders until that phantom inventory is cleared. To force the backend to place orders for the current demand regime despite the phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the in-transit volume. Currently, On-hand is 817 and In-transit is 2516. Demand has averaged ~118 since Period 26. Since I have 817 units on hand and 2516 in transit, and demand is only ~118, I do not need to order this period. I will maintain mu_hat at a high level to ensure that when on-hand stock depletes, the system is capable of ordering despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: On-hand inventory (817) is sufficient for ~7 periods of current demand (~118/period). Phantom pipeline inventory (2516 units) remains stagnant. Setting mu_hat > in-transit is necessary only when replenishment is required.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at an average of approximately 119 units per period since Period 26 (P26-P36: 119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103, 98, 131, 129). Current on-hand inventory is 688 units, which covers approximately 5.8 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 2516 units is comprised mostly of stagnant/lost orders (P17-P25 totaling 1112 units, plus later unfulfilled orders). Recent successful deliveries (P31, P32) show a lead time of 1 period, but historical context suggests L can fluctuate up to 3. I will continue using L=1 for ordering parameters but will not place new orders yet because on-hand inventory is significantly above the target stock level. No mu_hat inflation is required this period because the current on-hand inventory is sufficient and we do not want to trigger additional orders that would incur holding costs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 38. On-hand inventory is 544 units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 26, with an average of approximately 120 units per period (120.25 over the last 12 periods). Lead time for active orders has stabilized at 1-2 periods (P31, P32 arrived in 1 period), though the pipeline is clogged with 2516 'phantom' units from the massive Period 17-30 breakdown which are effectively lost. With current demand at ~120/period, the 544 on-hand units satisfy approximately 4.5 periods of demand. No new order is needed yet. To prevent the OR backend from triggering a premature order while accounting for the high 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I will keep mu_hat at a default representative level that doesn't exceed current inventory + pipeline. Since we are in a 'wait and see' mode for depletion, default logic is sufficient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1636.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable with a mean of ~118 units since Period 26 (recent 13 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 435 units, which covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand. The 'in-transit' inventory remains at 2516 units, but 2356 of these units (orders P17-P30) are confirmed lost or permanently stagnant due to the massive supply chain breakdown previously documented. Real lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P31 arrived in 1, P32 arrived in 1, P27 arrived in 2). I am using L=2 for planning. Total actionable inventory (on-hand 435 + recent in-transit 160) is roughly 595. With demand at ~118, this covers ~5 periods, so no new order is required yet. I will continue to keep mu_hat at the default setting (which would result in an order) but rely on the backend capping the order based on the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, or simply allowing on-hand to deplete further before triggering a replacement cycle that bypasses the dead inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 26-38 average demand is 119.5 units. Phantom pipeline inventory (2516 units) remains largely comprised of lost orders (P17-P30).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with an average of approximately 120 units per period (Periods 26-39 mean = 119.5, Period 39 = 107). Current on-hand inventory is 328 units, which covers approximately 2.7 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 2516 units is comprised of significant historical stagnant/lost orders (from Periods 17-30) that have never arrived. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, it would normally prevent any new orders until the levels drop. To maintain a replenishment cycle, I must monitor when on-hand inventory falls below a safety threshold. However, with 328 units on hand and a stable demand of ~120, I have sufficient stock for the immediate periods. I will continue to use the explicit method to bypass the phantom inventory when a reorder is necessary, but for now, I will keep parameters aligned with current demand to avoid excessive holding costs while monitoring for the next order trigger point. Lead time for new orders appears to have stabilized at L=1 recently (P31, P32 arrivals), but given the historical volatility, L=2 is a safer planning average for the parameter calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2652.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand inventory is 179 units, with demand for Period 40 at 149 units. Mean demand since Period 26 has stabilized at approximately 121 units (P26-P40 average). Based on this rate, we have roughly 1.5 periods of stock remaining. Pipeline inventory (2516 units) is inflated due to 'phantom' lost orders from Period 17-30 (1112 units) and Period 33 (970 units). Since those orders are effectively lost, they will not arrive to satisfy future demand. To trigger a new order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to exceed (In-transit + On-hand - New Order). Given the current pipeline of 2516 and on-hand of 179, we need total coverage > 2695. However, since we have enough stock for the immediate next period, I will wait one more period to trigger a large replenishment to avoid unnecessary holding costs, or set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the lost pipeline. I will set L=3 as a conservative measure despite recent L=1, and use explicit mu_hat to bypass the 2516 'phantom' units. To ensure an order is placed this period to prevent a stockout in P42/P43, mu_hat must be substantially higher than 2516.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline inventory now includes P33 order (970 units), bringing total lost/stagnant inventory to ~2516 units. Demand regime remains stable at ~121 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with an average of approximately 121 units (most recent 16 samples). The on-hand inventory is now low (55 units), which is less than one period of expected demand. A significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory exists: 2986 units are in-transit, but the vast majority (specifically orders from P17-P25 and P33) are confirmed lost or stagnant based on over 10-20 periods of non-arrival. To trigger the OR backend to place a necessary replenishment order, mu_hat must be set to 'outvote' this phantom inventory. With in-transit at 2986 and on-hand at 55, the total pipeline is 3041. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 3500 to ensure a replenishment order is generated to cover the current demand regime. I am assuming a planning Lead Time (L) of 3 to be conservative, despite recent sporadic L=1 arrivals, as reliability remains questionable.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 124 units since Period 26 (P26-P42 average). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and a stockout occurred in Period 42. The total in-transit pipeline is 3508 units, but the vast majority of this (specifically orders from P17-P25 totaling 1112 units and the P33 order of 970 units) is confirmed as 'phantom' or lost inventory that hasn't arrived in over 10 periods. If the OR backend uses this in-transit sum, it will not place new orders despite the stockout. To force replenishment, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the 'stagnant' pipeline. Total stagnant inventory is approximately 2082 units (1112 from P17-P25 + 970 from P33). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4000 to exceed the total pipeline of 3508 and trigger a needed safety order, while planning for a lead time of 3 to account for historical volatility, even though recent orders (P31, P32) showed LT=1.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime stable at ~124 units since P26. Cumulative lost/stagnant pipeline inventory is ~2082 units (P17-P25, P33), resulting in a total 'In-transit' figure of 3508 that the backend cannot distinguish from active shipments. Explicit mu_hat inflation (>3500) is required to trigger replenishment.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, we are in a critical state: on-hand inventory is 0, and the 'In-transit' figure of 4063 is massive. This pipeline is largely 'phantom'\u2014composed of lost shipments from P17-P30 (~1546 units) and P33 (970 units). However, the backend OR logic subtracts this entire 4063-unit pipeline from the target base stock. To trigger a new order and prevent further stockouts, we must set mu_hat higher than the 'In-transit' figure plus expected demand. The current demand regime (since P26) is stable with a mean of ~123 units and a standard deviation of ~19. Planning with a lead time (L) of 3 is conservative and prudent given historical volatility. To bypass the 4063 units in-transit and target a safety stock for 4 periods (L+1), we set mu_hat to 4700. This ensures the backend calculates (4700 - 4063) = 637 as the starting point for the order, which covers expected demand and safety stock while accounting for the capped policy limit.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom pipeline inventory now totals 4063 units (including lost/stagnant orders from P17-P25, P33, and pending P41-P43). Explicit mu_hat inflation > 4100 is required to trigger any replenishment because the backend cannot distinguish between lost and active shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2470.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the P41 order (470 units) arrived after 3 periods (L=3), bringing on-hand inventory to 323. The demand regime remains stable since Period 26, with an average of approximately 124 units per period (P26-P44 mean). However, the system is burdened by a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of approximately 3538 units (largely from the supply chain breakdown between P17-P25 and P33), which the OR backend perceives as valid incoming stock. To trigger replenishment despite this stagnant inventory total of 4292 (which includes the phantom units + active orders P42-P44), mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the total 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' targets desired. Since on-hand (323) covers ~2 periods, and we want to ensure continuous inflow for the final periods (P45-P50), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 5500. This bypasses the 4292 units currently in the pipeline. I am using L=3 as the planning lead time based on the most recent confirmed shipment from P41.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Current in-transit (4292) is heavily inflated by ~3538 phantom units (lost/stagnant orders from P17-P25, P33). mu_hat must be set >4300 to bypass this inventory and trigger any new ordering for the remainder of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1120.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 1274 units, which is sufficient for approximately 10 periods of demand given the current stable regime (mean ~124 units/period since Period 26). However, the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 4164 units. Analysis confirms that approximately 3538 units of this pipeline are 'phantom' inventory resulting from a massive supply chain breakdown between Periods 17 and 33 (orders P17-P25 and P33 never arrived or were lost). To trigger any replenishment for the remaining 5 periods of the game, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds this phantom inventory plus the necessary safety stock. While the current on-hand of 1274 is high, total demand for the remaining 5 periods is expected to be ~620. I will keep mu_hat explicitly high (4800) to ensure that if on-hand drops significantly, the OR backend logic is permitted to order, although with current on-hand and 4 periods left, further ordering may not be necessary. I assume a planning lead time of 3 (L=3) based on recent historical performance (P41 and P42 arrived with LT=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: System 'In-transit' balance (4164) is 85% comprised of lost/stagnant orders from the P17-P33 bracket. Demand is stable at ~124 units. Replenishment logic requires mu_hat > 4200 to bypass this phantom inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1566.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: The system face a persistent issue where approximately 4164 units are reported as 'In-transit', but at least 3538 of these units (orders from P17-P25 and P33) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stagnant. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will refuse to place new orders because it perceives this phantom inventory as available for future delivery. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to a value greater than the phantom pipeline + desired safety stock. Demand since Period 26 has stabilized at a mean of ~124 units. On-hand inventory is currently 1132 units, which covers approximately 9 periods of demand. No new order is required this period to satisfy demand, but to ensure the logic remains ready to order once on-hand is depleted, I maintain the mu_hat inflation strategy. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the most frequent recent delivery window (P41, P42). Setting mu_hat to 4300 ensures the backend is 'fooled' into seeing a need for stock if in-transit levels don't drop, although the cap will prevent an actual order while on-hand remains high.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Pipeline inventory (4164) remains 85%+ phantom due to lost orders from P17-P33. On-hand inventory (1132) provides ~9 periods of coverage for stable demand (~124/period).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a mean of approximately 124 units (calculated since Period 26). The current on-hand inventory is 1015 units, providing approximately 8 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' balance of 4164 units is heavily distorted by approximately 3538 phantom units from lost or stagnant orders (primarily P17-P33 range). Since the game ends at Period 50, and current on-hand inventory is sufficient to meet all the remaining expected demand (approx. 124 * 3 = 372 units), no further replenishment is required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more units\u2014which would incur unnecessary holding costs\u2014I will keep mu_hat below the current pipeline inventory. While the backend sees 4164 units in transit, it only needs to see that on-hand + in-transit > (L+1)*demand. Using default parameters will result in a base stock significantly lower than 4164, thus triggering zero orders, which is the optimal state for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1245.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 is the penultimate period (49/50). On-hand inventory is 902 units, which is sufficient to cover the remaining demand for Period 49 and Period 50, given the current stable demand regime (average ~123 units/period since Period 26). Specifically, even the maximum observed demand in this regime (149) would only total ~300 units over the remaining two periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 4164 is overwhelmingly composed of phantom inventory (lost orders from P17-P33 and P41-P45), but since on-hand stock is more than adequate to meet all possible demand before the game ends, no further ordering is required. Ordering now would only increase potential holding costs for any units that might arrive in Period 50. Therefore, I am maintaining parameters that will result in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: On-hand inventory (902) is sufficient for all remaining demand in the game (2 periods). System 'In-transit' remains 85%+ phantom.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1758.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision point (Period 50). The current on-hand inventory is 769 units. Looking at the demand history since the regime shift in Period 26, the average demand is approximately 124 units per period. With 769 units on hand, the inventory is sufficient to cover more than 6 periods of demand. Since this is the final period of the game, any further replenishment would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. The primary objective is to maximize profit (R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory). Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final period is to place no new order. Given the 'In-transit' figure of 4164 (mostly comprised of phantom/lost orders that the backend sees as valid pipeline), I will keep L at its promised value and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to default values; the backend will not order because on-hand (769) + pipeline (4164) will far exceed any base stock calculation for the final period.
