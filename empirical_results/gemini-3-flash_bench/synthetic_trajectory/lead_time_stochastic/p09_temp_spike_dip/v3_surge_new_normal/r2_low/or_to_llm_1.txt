Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [146, 110, 112, 150, 59]. Recent actual demand from the game history shows Period 1: 140 and Period 2: 136. The average demand is approximately 138 units per period. \n4. Target Calculation: To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the order cycle (1), we need to cover 3 periods of demand. 3 * 138 = 414 units. \n5. Action: Currently, we have 352 units in the pipeline. To reach the target of ~414, we need approximately 62 units. The OR recommendation of 14 units is extremely low because its 'base stock' calculation likely sees 352 in transit as nearly sufficient for its internal targets, but it doesn't account for the immediate stockout risk.

Pipeline (In-transit) is 414 units (176 from P1, 176 from P2, 62 from P3). Total sales to date are 0 due to stockouts, while historical demand averages ~115 units/period.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show significant demand, but the system shows 0 units sold because no inventory has arrived yet. \n4.

Decision: Since the Period 1 order is already late, I must assume a longer lead time or potential loss. However, placing another large order now when 414 units (roughly 3.5 periods of demand) are already in flight creates a massive risk of high holding costs if they all arrive at once.

Specifically, P15 (50) and P17 (120) are now overdue (6 and 4 periods in transit respectively). \n4. **OR Recommendation Analysis**: OR suggests 0 units because its internal base-stock calculation sees a massive pipeline of 1,165 relative to a smoothed historical demand mean that doesn't fully weigh the recent surge.

Current average demand (245) x (L+1=3) = 735 units needed in the pipeline. With 890 in the pipeline, we are theoretically covered *if* the shipments arrive.

Effective pipeline = 1095 - 695 = 400 units. These 400 units consist of P24 (250) and P25 (100) and the current order. Note: P23 arrived in P25.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: A major regime shift occurred at P16. Demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) averages ~256 units. The product is 'chips(Regular)', and while no specific calendar dates are provided, the surge is sustained. \n\n4. **OR Baseline & Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the high 'raw' in-transit figure (1095) relative to its historical mean. However, excluding lost shipments, we only have 350 units (P24+P25) coming in. To cover a 2-period lead time + current period (3 periods of demand) at ~256 units/period, we need roughly 768 units in the pipeline. Current effective pipeline is 350. Order = 768 - 350 = 418.

The raw In-transit is 1455. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from P17-19 (420 units), P24 (250 units), and P25 (100 units) are confirmed lost. This totals 770 lost units.

Specifically, orders from P41 (125) and P42 (125) are likely to arrive within the next 1-2 periods given the usual 1-3 period lead time delivery pattern.

With an expected demand of ~115 units per period and an arrival of 125 units (from P42) likely occurring during Period 45, on-hand should barely cover Period 45 demand. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it looks at the gross pipeline of 1625 units without accounting for losses.

Specifically, the only viable order in the pipeline is the 125 units ordered in P45. Demand analysis: Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 120 units over the last 10 periods. Final strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the unadjusted pipeline of 1625 units.
