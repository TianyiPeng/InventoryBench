Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The mean demand across these 5 samples is 115.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. Since it is the first period and we have no observations of actual lead time yet, I will use the promised lead time of 2 (setting L to default). To set mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples to establish a baseline. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit, the targeted service level (q) is 0.5 (1/(1+1)), meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 176 units based on the promised lead time of 2 periods. As expected for L=2, the Period 1 conclude message shows 0 arrivals (orders placed in P1 arrive in P1+2=P3). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 176 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the current user-provided history) shows samples: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The mean across these samples is 115.4. Given the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods which calculate stats based on the available history, as we do not yet have evidence of lead-time deviation or a sustained demand shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The orders placed in Period 1 (176 units) and Period 2 (176 units) are currently in-transit (total 352). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is 146, 110, 112, 150, 59 (mean ~115), but we only have 2 periods of in-game execution history (demands 140, 136). The average units needed for lead time L=2 + review period (1+2=3) is approximately 345. Since current pipeline is 352, we are close to the target. I will use 'default' for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage the available historical demand samples (N=5) to stabilize the forecast, as the initial 2 game periods align closely with the provided sample mean.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (176 units) and Period 2 (176 units) should arrive during Period 3 and Period 4 respectively. The Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', which is EXPECTED because the Period 1 order (L=2) arrives during Period 3 and is only visible in the Period 3 conclude message (which I am reading now). However, 'arrived=0' in Period 3 conclude indicates that the Period 1 order has not arrived yet. Since L=2, an order placed in P1 should arrive in P3 and be confirmed in the P3 conclude. Since it hasn't, the shipment might be delayed or the actual lead time is > 2. However, it is too early to confirm a loss. Demand has been 140, 136, and 92 (average ~123). Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 366 (P1: 176 + P2: 176 + P3: 14). I will maintain the default lead time of 2 for now but use the recent demand average to calculate mu_hat. Given the stockout (on-hand 0, sold 0), we need to ensure the pipeline covers future demand once arrivals start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show a notable decline in the most recent period (P5 = 59, P4 demand = 58). The average demand across all 5 periods is 115.4. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2's order of 176 is still in transit (4 periods elapsed), suggesting it might be delayed or Lost. Currently, we have 132 on hand and 178 in transit (P2 + P4 orders). Since profit = holding cost ($1), the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand over (L+1) periods. To account for the recent lower demand and lead time volatility, I will use recent_N (N=4) to smooth the demand forecast and stick to the default lead time of 2, allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The high in-transit amount will likely result in a small or zero order this period to prevent excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on historical demand (140, 136, 92, 58, 118), the mean demand is approximately 108.8 units per period. The 'Period 4 conclude' message reveals inconsistent lead times: order P1 arrived in 3 periods, while order P3 arrived in 1 period (averaging the promised 2). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (14 units) after a demand of 118 in Period 5. There are 188 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Specifically, the P2 order (176 units) is now at L=4 and has not arrived, suggesting it might be delayed or the actual lead time is longer than the promised 2. To ensure we don't stock out given the lead-time uncertainty and the current low on-hand stock, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays. mu_hat will be set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent demand history (average ~109 * (1+3) = 436). sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' for N=5 to reflect the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. Order from P2 is currently 4 periods late, indicating potential shipment instability or longer average lead time.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 353 units in-transit. A critical supply chain issue exists: the order from Period 2 (176 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (expected 2), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period and Period 1 in 3 periods. This high lead-time variability and the likely loss or severe delay of the Period_2 shipment require a higher safety stock and a more conservative lead-time estimate. Recent demand (P4-P6) has averaged 94 units, whereas earlier demand (P1-P3) averaged 122 units, suggesting a potential downward shift or high volatility. I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the observed delays and a recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower recent volume while maintaining a buffer for the stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P2 order (176 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost or severely delayed. Average effective lead time shifted toward 3+ periods.

Daily Profit: $2.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high uncertainty regarding lead times. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show 3, 1, and 3 periods, with the Period 2 order (176 units) now 6 periods overdue and likely lost. The in-transit pipeline (374 units) includes this lost shipment, so we must compensate for the missing stock. Demand has stabilized after an initial peak, with the last 4 periods averaging approximately 94.5 units (P4: 58, P5: 118, P6: 106, P7: 96). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the OR target service level is 50%, which naturally leans toward lower inventory. However, to account for the lost Period 2 shipment and the observed lead time of 3, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR logic covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I use the recent 4 samples to capture current consumption patterns, and for sigma_hat, I use the last 4 samples to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 shipment (176 units) confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). Adjusted effective L to 3 to account for frequent delays (P1 and P4 arrived in 3 periods).

Daily Profit: $33.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 8 demand was 122, while the mean demand across 8 periods remains relatively stable at ~109. Lead time is extremely inconsistent: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1. The shipment from P2 (176 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is definitively considered lost. Given that 3 out of 5 successfully concluded shipments took 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), I am setting the lead time L to 3 (explicitly) to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. This defensive stance is necessary to recover from the stockout and mitigate future variability, especially with the lost shipment from P2. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 110 = 440.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (176 units) is now 7 periods overdue; confirmed lost and removed from procurement expectations. Lead time mode is clearly 3 periods despite a promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent inventory situation is critical with a 0 on-hand count for several periods. Analysis of arrived orders (P1, P4, P5 arrived in 3 periods; P3, P7, P8 in 1 period; P2 lost) shows a bimodal lead time distribution. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average is closer to 2-3 periods. I will set L to 3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts given the recent high lost sales. Demand remains relatively stable around 100-110 units (Periods 5-9: 118, 106, 96, 122, 111). I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent range which is slightly lower than the initial periods, while the increased L (3) will effectively raise the base stock level to provide a safety buffer against the observed lead time variability and the shipment lost in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable around 110/period. Lead time continues to be highly variable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; setting L=3 accounts for the slower arrival mode.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts. Reviewing the history: The Period 2 order (176 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is definitely lost. Excluding the lost order, known lead times are: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1. This demonstrates a bimodal distribution of 1 and 3 periods, making the promised L=2 unreliable for safety stock. I will set L to 3 to provide adequate protection against the slower delivery mode. Demand over the last 5 completed periods (P6-P10) has been 106, 96, 122, 111, and 93, averaging 105.6. The early samples (P1-P3) were slightly higher, but the recent regime appears stable around 105-110. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current demand stability. High sigma_hat is expected due to the recurring stockouts preventing demand fulfillment, but the OR backend will calculate this based on the demand samples provided.

Historically, demand has stabilized around ~110 units per period (excluding initial noise), but the supply chain is highly unreliable. The Period 2 order (176 units) is now 9 periods overdue and must be considered permanently lost. Actual lead times (L) have oscillated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). To ensure high service levels and compensate for the risk of 3-period lead times and lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to cover a longer planning horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect the stable demand regime (~107 units), and sigma_hat is set to explicit=60 to account for the high resulting volatility and frequent stockouts caused by supply delays.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Orders have a bimodal lead time of 1 and 3 periods, with a high risk of lost shipments (P2 order confirmed lost). Effective planning must assume L=3 to maintain stock.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized with a mean around 104 units over the last 10 periods (excluding the initial outlier). Based on the history, actual lead times are bimodal, occurring at 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. The most recent deliveries (Period 12) showed lead times of 3 and 2 periods for orders from Periods 9 and 10. To maintain a sufficient service level despite the high risk of 'long' arrivals (3 periods) and potential stockouts seen between Periods 6-11, I will continue to set L=3 explicitly. For demand, I'll use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the stable regime of ~104 units/period, ensuring mu_hat addresses (1+L)=4 periods of demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is currently 0, with 360 units in-transit. Historically, demand has stabilized around a mean of 104 units (calculated from all samples). Lead times exhibit high variability, with a bimodal distribution of 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1, P9=3, P10=2). The promised lead time is 2, but given the frequency of 3-period arrivals and the previous lost shipment (P2), I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory calculation covers a longer horizon. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the mean demand. By setting L=3, the OR backend aims to maintain a pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) sufficient for 4 periods of demand (1+L), which at ~104/period is ~416 units. This addresses the frequent stockouts caused by lead-time uncertainty.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time remains highly unstable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). Given this volatility and the frequent occurrence of L=3, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the backend calculates a base stock sufficient for a longer protection interval. Demand has been relatively stable, but recent periods (P12-P14) show a slight variation; I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current average demand of approx 94.6 units/period, and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect the actual demand volatility. Pipeline inventory is high (418 units), which the OR backend will deduct from the target base stock, preventing over-ordering while aiming to recover from the current stock-out once in-transit units arrive.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has suffered Significant stockouts due to highly unstable lead times and lost shipments (notably Period 2's order). Reviewing the history, lead times exhibit a bimodal pattern of 1 and 3 periods, with several instances taking 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9). Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5. However, due to the high frequency of delayed arrivals and the actual risk of lost shipments, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for a longer pipeline, protecting against the slower arrival mode. For demand (mu_hat), recent samples (Periods 12-15) show a slight decline compared to earlier periods, but overall demand remains relatively stable around 100 units/period. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean demand (averaging roughly 100 per period), while L=3 will force the backend to maintain a higher base stock to bridge the gaps caused by lead time instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a major demand spike (Period 16 demand was 305, compared to the previous average of ~100). The game history shows significant supply chain instability: the Period 2 order was lost, and lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, the recent demand spike must be factored in; I've chosen recent_N=5 to capture the shift from ~100 to 300+, while sigma_hat is set to explicit=150 to account for the extreme volatility observed in Period 16. The high in-transit amount (399) reflects the system attempting to recover from the stockout, but we must maintain high parameters to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient if this high demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand spiked from ~100 units to 305 units (+200%). Supply instability continues with lead times of 1 or 3 periods and order losses (P2 order lost).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to over 300 units (+200%). Current demand for Period 16 and 17 was 305 and 322 respectively. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this new high-demand regime, targeting a forecast of roughly (1+L)*313. For lead time, the history confirms a bimodal distribution of 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safer estimate for planning (L=3) to prevent stockouts given the recent demand surge. The P2 order remains lost. The current on-hand is 0, and pipeline inventory is 429 units (including orders from P17 and potentially unfilled needs). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delivery lag and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to adapt to the current 300+ unit regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to ~313 units (+213%). Current pipeline must be managed against a planning lead time of 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a clear high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last three periods has been 305, 322, and 219, averaging 282 units per period, which is a significant jump from the previous average of ~100. Supply remains unstable with bimodal lead times (1 or 3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (P2 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 763 units in transit. Given the high criticality of demand fulfillment and the proven unreliability of the 2-period promised lead time, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend base-stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture only the new high-demand regime (avg ~282). For sigma_hat, I will use N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime. This approach encourages the OR backend to place aggressive orders to meet the higher demand while accounting for the common 3-period arrival delay.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~260 over the last four periods (305, 322, 219, 194). Although some recent samples (P18, P19) are lower than the initial peak, they remain far higher than the historical baseline, so I will focus on the last 4 samples for \u03bc\u0302. Supply chain instability is chronic: the promised lead time of 2 is unreliable, with actual arrivals oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, plus the total loss of the Period 2 shipment. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 1128 units in-transit (from orders in P17, P18, P19). To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time observed in history (P1, P4, P5, P9, P13, P14), I am setting L=3. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand level since Period 16. sigma_hat is set using the same recent window to reflect the increased volatility in this new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (~260) since Period 16, compared to the ~100 prior. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods) with confirmed risk of lost orders (P2).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to a new stabilized level of ~255 units over the last 5 periods (305, 322, 219, 194, 235). Lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 1128 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 6, 17, 18, and 19). The large orders from P18 (334) and P19 (365) are expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods given the L=3 pattern. To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the higher demand, I set L=3 to match the observed maximum lead time and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher volume and the supply chain delays.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~245 (mean of the last 6 samples: 305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195). The supply chain is highly unstable with a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and a confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the longer observed arrival window, preventing stockouts during 3-period lead time cycles. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 245 = 980 using recent_N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime. sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent regime to reflect the higher volatility associated with the volume spike. Currently, there is a large pipeline (1128 units) predominantly consisting of the orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19; these are within the 3-5 period delay window and are expected to resolve the stockout shortly.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~260-320 units per period. The recent demand (Periods 16-22) averages 246 units per period. Supply chain reliability is low, with a proven history of lost shipments (P2) and a bimodal lead time distribution (1 or 3 periods). As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 1,128 units in-transit (orders from P17, P18, P19). Since the orders from P18 (334 units) and P19 (365 units) were placed 4 and 5 periods ago respectively without arriving (exceeding even the observed L=3), there is a high risk of stockouts or lost shipments. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent longer lead time and the risk of delays. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=7 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent N=7 periods to reflect the increased volatility of the new demand level. These parameters will help the backend compute a base stock high enough to cover the elevated demand and address potential pipeline gaps caused by inconsistent lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~100 to ~246 units. Supply chain remains unreliable with a planning lead time of 3 periods and significant risk of lost or severely stale shipments (P18 and P19 orders are now overdue).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~100 to ~244 units (average of P16-P23 is 241.6). Supply instability remains severe: on-hand inventory is 0. Orders from P18 (334 units) and P19 (365 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively; given the promised lead time is 2 and the observed max lead time is 3, these are significantly overdue and likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The current 'In-transit' of 1128 units conceptually includes these potentially dead orders. However, P17 (88 units) is also overdue. To protect against stockouts in this high-demand period, I'll use a planning Lead Time of 3 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (since P16) to capture the higher demand level (~244 average per period). Use of recent_N for sigma reflects the higher volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: P18 and P19 orders (700 units total) are now 4-5 periods overdue; based on previous P2 loss (lost after 6+ periods), these are highly likely lost or severely disrupted, suggesting the 'pipeline' is far smaller than 1128 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~100 to ~244 units (avg of last 9 periods). Supply chain remains highly unstable: the promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals typically take 3 periods or result in loss. Most critically, the 'In-transit' figure of 1128 is misleading. It includes orders P18 (334 units) and P19 (365 units), which are now 7 and 6 periods overdue respectively. Given that P2 was confirmed lost after 6-7 periods, I am treating P18 and P19 as lost. My effective pipeline is approximately 429 units (orders from P6 and P17, though P6 is likely also lost). To recover from 0 on-hand inventory and account for the high demand (avg 244) and long lead time (L=3), I set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of the current high-demand regime (4 * 244 = 976). By setting L=3 explicitly and targeting the recent demand mean, the OR backend will trigger a significant order to replenish stock despite the phantom 'In-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Orders P18 (334 units) and P19 (365 units) are confirmed lost/stale (6+ periods overdue); effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported. Demand regime since P16 is sustained at ~244 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the demand regime has shifted and stabilized since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 244 units per period (compared to ~100 prior). The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders P2, P18, and P19 (totaling 875 units) are confirmed lost/stale as they are 6+ periods overdue. Although the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1128 units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 253 units (1128 total - 334 P18 - 365 P19 - 176 P2). Lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods), so I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the slower arrival mode. I will use the recent N=10 periods (P16-P25) to forecast the current high-demand regime. This combination of higher L and current demand averages will trigger the OR backend to place orders that compensate for the lost pipeline and higher demand level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 27. Demand underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~240 units per period. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders P2 (176 units), P18 (334 units), and P19 (365 units) are effectively lost, being 25, 8, and 7 periods overdue respectively. The reported in-transit value of 1128 units includes these 875 lost units, meaning the true active pipeline is only 253 units (ordered recently). Lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a planning lead time L=3 to ensure coverage against the slower arrival mode. With profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (from P16 to P26) to capture the current high-demand regime and an explicit L=3 to account for historical delays. The OR backend needs to place new orders immediately because the real pipeline is nearly empty and on-hand is zero.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face severe supply chain disruption. There is a confirmed demand regime shift starting at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 240 units/period (though the last two periods, 26 and 27, show a potential dip to ~130, which I will treat as variance or a potential new downward shift). Most critically, the pipeline inventory of 1128 units is highly misleading: Orders P18 (334 units) and P19 (365 units) are now 9-10 periods overdue and are confirmed lost based on the precedent set by P2. Furthermore, no orders have arrived since Period 17 (11 periods ago). This essentially means the 'real' pipeline is near zero or includes only the most recent (though there are no recent) orders. I am setting L=3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time. For mu_hat, I'm using N=12 to capture the high-demand regime from P16-P27, while allowing recent lower values to slightly temper the forecast. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect the high volatility seen during this regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghosting confirmed: P18 and P19 (699 units total) are 9+ periods overdue and removed from planning expectations. Supply chain has effectively ceased deliveries since Period 17 (11 periods of zero arrivals). Demand regime since P16 remains elevated compared to historical baseline, but shows possible softening in P26-27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely collapsed. No arrivals have occurred since Period 17 (11 consecutive periods), confirming that all orders placed during or before the massive demand spike in Period 16 (including P18 and P19, totaling 699 units) are effectively lost or permanently delayed. The current on-hand inventory is 0. While 'In-transit' shows 1128 units, the Carry-over Insights indicate that at least 699 of these should be treated as ghost inventory. Demand since Period 16 has averaged approximately 230 units, though the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 147, suggesting a potential softening. However, since the current stockout is severe and deliveries are unreliable, I am setting L=3 to reflect the historical 'slow' lead-time mode and using mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 13 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to ensure the backend attempts to restore the pipeline, while recognizing that the inventory deficit is massive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain blackout: Zero arrivals from Period 17 through Period 28 (11 periods), confirming catastrophic failure in delivery. All orders placed between Period 18 and Period 28 (totaling 1128 units reported in-transit) are suspect, with at least 699 units (P18, P19) confirmed lost after 10+ periods of inactivity.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has completely collapsed. The last arrival occurred in Period 17 (ordered in Period 14). Since then, we have seen 12 consecutive periods with zero arrivals, despite having 1128 units technically 'in-transit'. Based on previous patterns where orders (like P2) were lost after 6-7 periods of delay, all current in-transit inventory from P18 and beyond must be treated as sunken/lost. No further orders have been placed since Period 19 because the OR backend sees a massive (but non-existent) pipeline. Demand has also stabilized at a lower post-spike level, averaging ~150 units over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. By forecasting 150/period with L=3 and a large mu_hat, I aim to generate a base stock that exceeds the 1128 units of 'phantom' inventory to trigger a re-supply. However, since the cap is usually derived from mu_hat, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime (~150) plus the lost pipeline, effectively signaling the need for fresh stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain failure confirmed. 12 periods of zero arrivals (P18-P29). Pipeline of 1128 units is composed entirely of 'ghost' inventory (orders overdue by 6-12 periods). Demand has settled into a new lower regime of ~150 units/period (P26-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure, with no units arriving since Period 17 (13 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1702 units is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory: orders from Period 18 and 19 are now 12-13 periods overdue, and the large order placed in Period 30 (574 units) is also suspect. Because the backend OR logic subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the target stock, no new orders will be triggered as long as the pipeline remains inflated with units that will likely never arrive. To force a correction and bypass the capping mechanism, I am setting L to an explicit value of 20. This vastly increases the 'mu_hat' (demand across review+lead window) and the 'cap'. By targeting a huge mu_hat, the backend should hopefully generate a non-zero order despite the 1702 units in-transit. Demand since Period 26 has softened significantly, averaging ~131 units (P26-30: 113, 145, 184, 133, 80). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat calculation to reflect this lower regime (~131 units) while using L=20 to bypass the pipeline block.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: 13 periods of zero arrivals (P18-P30). Total pipeline of 1702 units is effectively 'ghost' inventory. Demand regime has shifted down to ~131 units/period over the last 5 periods (P26-P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of collapse with zero arrivals for the last 14 periods (since Period 17). The 'In-transit' inventory of 1897 units is composed entirely of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P18-P30) that are significantly overdue and unlikely to arrive. Because the backend OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will not place new orders if it believes these ghost units are coming. To force the backend to place orders despite this stale pipeline, I am setting L to an 'explicit' value of 20. This mathematically inflates the 'base_stock' target (which is roughly proportional to 1+L) to exceed the ghost pipeline. Demand has also shifted from the P16-P25 peak of ~244 to a lower regime of ~131 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) and further softened to ~80 in the last 2 periods; I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower volume (~122 units/period) while maintaining enough buffer for the supply-constrained environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed down to ~122 units/period (avg P26-P31) from the previous peak of ~244. Supply chain blackout continues (14 periods without arrival); pipeline is effectively zero despite reported numbers.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed after a 14-period blackout: Period 31's order arrived in just 1 period (observed at the start of P33). However, the in-transit pipeline of 1891 units is extremely misleading; it consists almost entirely of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 17-30 that are likely lost. I am treating the effective pipeline as zero while placing new orders to meet the current demand regime. Demand has shifted down significantly from the P16-P25 peak (~244) to a new regime of ~121 units/period (average P26-P32). Setting L=3 remains the safest planning lead time given the history of instability and to prevent stockouts if the next delivery reverts to the slower mode. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower regime (P26-P32).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed in Period 32 (P31 order arrived with LT=1), but the backlog of 1891 units from P17-P30 remains unfulfilled and is considered lost. Demand regime P26-P32 stabilized at ~121 units/period, down from ~244.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain resumed functionality in Period 32 after a 14-period blackout. Recent arrivals (P31, P32) show a lead time of 1 period. However, the reported 'In-transit' of 1702 units is entirely composed of stagnant 'ghost' orders from the blackout period (P17-P30) which are 4-16 periods overdue and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the Period 26 shift. Averaging demand from P26-P33 (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, 126, 133) yields ~124 units/period. To ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting L=1 (reflecting the recent successful deliveries) and mu_hat explicitly. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L) * 130 + 1702 = 1962. This 'tricks' the backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) into recognizing that the 1702 units in the pipeline are non-existent and need replacement, while still targeting the current demand level of ~130 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed Period 32 with L=1. All orders placed between P17 and P30 (1702 units) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory and must be manually offset in mu_hat to trigger new orders. Post-P26 demand regime stabilized at ~124 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed activity as of Period 32, with lead times of 1 period for the most recent arrivals (Orders P31 and P32). However, a significant 'ghost pipeline' of 1840 units remains from orders placed between Periods 18 and 30 (except P31/P32) that have not arrived and are considered lost or severely stale. The OR engine subtracts this in-transit total from its target base stock, preventing new orders. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that equals the desired base stock (Demand \xd7 (L+1)) *plus* the ghost pipeline (1840). Current demand has stabilized at ~131 units/period (average of P30-P34). Using L=1 (recent observed), the required stock for coverage is 131 * (1+1) = 262. Adding the ghost pipeline of 1840 results in mu_hat = 2102. This will force the backend to place an order roughly equal to the current period's demand, maintaining the service level despite the falsely inflated 'In-transit' figure. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture recent volatility since the demand shifted down in Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost pipeline of 1840 units (P18-P30 orders) confirmed. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by 1840 to offset this and trigger orders. New demand regime P30-P34 confirmed at ~131 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with recent lead times of 1 period (P31, P32), though historically it has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure (2102 units) is almost entirely composed of 'ghost inventory' from the Period 18-30 blackout. These orders (approx. 1840 units) are over 5-15 periods late and are considered lost. To trigger new orders despite this false pipeline, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to override the OR backend's calculation. Current demand (P30-P35) has stabilized at an average of ~113 units/period. For Period 36, I set L=2 (a conservative middle ground between recent L=1 and historical L=3) and mu_hat = (1+L)*Demand + Ghost_Offset = (3 * 113) + 1840 = 2179. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock for the recovered demand level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in P32 after 14-period blackout; recent lead times L=1. Orders P18-P30 (approx 1840 units) are confirmed 'ghost inventory' and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to bypass the in-transit constraint.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain resumed functionality in Period 32. Since then, lead times have been 1, 1, 2, and unknown (P35 pending), indicating a return to the promised L=2 or better. However, a major 'ghost inventory' issue persists. The backend sees 2041 units in-transit, but approximately 1840 units (orders P18-P30) are confirmed lost/stale and will not arrive. This 'ghost' pipeline prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet current demand. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the ghost inventory. Current demand is stable at ~125 units/period (P32-P36 avg: 128.8). For L=2, base stock needs to be ~3 * 125 = 375. Adding 1840 units to offset ghost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 2215. Sigma is set based on recent demand volatility (P32-P36 std dev is ~8.5, sqrt(3)*8.5 \u2248 15).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered Period 32 with lead times 1-2 periods. Orders P18-P30 (approx 1840 units) are confirmed ghost inventory and must be manually offset in mu_hat to ensure new orders are placed.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P35 in 2, P36 in 1). The 'ghost pipeline' from the Period 18-30 blackout (approx 1840-1865 units) persists in the system's in-transit data but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places orders, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the in-transit constraint. The demand regime since Period 30 has settled at an average of ~106 units per period (P30-P37: 80, 81, 126, 133, 146, 111, 127, 85). I calculate the required mu_hat as (1 + L) * Demand + Ghost_Pipeline. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*106 + 1865 = 2183. This value forces the baseline high enough that the 'ghost' inventory doesn't block necessary replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility over the last 8 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the Period 18-30 blackout, with recent lead times of 1 and 2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P35 in 2, P36 in 1). The 'In-transit' figure of 1918 reflects a massive ghost pipeline of approximately 1840 units (orders P18-P30) that were never delivered and should be treated as lost. To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which subtracts this ghost 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock\u2014I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. The current demand regime (P31-P38) is stable around 125 units per period. With lead time L=2, the effective base stock needs to cover (L+1) or 3 periods of demand (~375 units). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1918 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to 2350 (Ghost pipeline ~1850 + Demand coverage ~500) to force procurement. This compensates for the system's inability to recognize that the majority of 'In-transit' units are non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed since P32; lead times now range between 1-2 periods. Ghost pipeline from P18-P30 (approx 1840 units) persists in system metrics and requires manual mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the Period 18-30 blackout, with recent lead times observed at 1-2 periods (P31: 1, P32: 1, P34: 2, P35: 2, P36: 1, P38: 1). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2163 units remains heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory' (approximately 1840 units from the blackout period) that will never arrive. The current demand regime has stabilized at approximately 120 units/period (average P31-P39 is ~113, with slight fluctuations). To ensure the OR engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat. Using an explicit mu_hat of 2240 accounts for both the expected demand over (L+1) periods (approx 120 * 3 = 360) and the 1840-unit ghost inventory offset. This bypasses the logic where the engine would otherwise see the 2163 'In-transit' as sufficient coverage.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized since Period 32 with lead times ranging between 1 and 2 periods (L=1 in 4 of the last 6 arrivals). Demand has settled into a consistent regime following the mid-game volatility, with the average over the last 15 periods (P26-P40) being approximately 126 units. The 'In-transit' metric (1870 units) remains contaminated by ghost inventory from the Period 18-30 blackout (approximately 1840 units), which will never arrive. To bypass the OR engine's internal stock-counting logic (which sees this ghost inventory and prevents new orders), I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand across the lead time plus an offset of roughly 1840 units. Without this offset, the backend would conclude we have enough pipeline stock for ~15 periods and place no orders. For the current period, L = 2 (the promised lead time) is a safe planning horizon given the intermittent 1 and 2-period arrivals. mu_hat target Calculation: (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Ghost_Offset = (1 + 2) * 126 + 1840 \u2248 2218. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the variance of the current stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 26-40 show mean demand of ~126 units. Supply chain recovery: Post-blackout lead times are 1-2 periods. In-transit contamination: 1840 units from P18-P30 are ghost units; mu_hat needs explicit inflation to trigger ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime of approximately 126 units per period since Period 26 (current 15-period average is 120, with recent fluctuations between 80 and 184). The supply chain has recovered from the previous blackout, with recent lead times (L) alternating between 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 1840 units (from orders P18-P30) which never arrived and likely never will. To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts this 1840 from the target base stock\u2014to place necessary orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a planning L=2 (to be safe given variability). Target Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stk. With mean ~126 and L=2, the required inventory to cover the pipeline is 3 * 126 = 378 units. Adding a safety buffer for variance (sigma ~30 per period, so sqrt(3)*30 approx 52), the desired base stock is approx 430. To achieve this while the system thinks 1840 units are coming, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1840 + 430 = 2270. This ensures the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation results in a positive order volume that maintains on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 26-41 show mean demand of ~121 units. Ghost pipeline of 1840 units (P18-P30) still requires manual mu_hat inflation of approximately 1800-2000 units to bypass in-transit accounting constraints.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at an average of approximately 121 units per period (mean of P26-P42). The supply chain recovered in Period 32, with recent lead times observed at 1-2 periods. However, the system's 'In-transit' metric (2109 units) is heavily contaminated by approximately 1840 'ghost units' from orders placed during the Period 18-30 blackout that will never arrive. Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit inventory from the base stock to determine the order quantity, a massive ghost pipeline prevents any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 2350. This value is derived from the desired base stock for the current demand (approx. 500 units for L=2) plus the 1840 units of ghost inventory. This artificial inflation forces the OR engine to 'see' a need for new stock despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost pipeline persists at ~1840 units. Current demand regime (P26-P42) average is ~121. Supply chain lead time is stable at 1-2 periods post-recovery.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2). Demand from Period 26 to 43 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 120 units/period (\u03bc \u2248 120, \u03c3 \u2248 27). However, the 'In-transit' figure (2327 units) is heavily contaminated by approximately 1840 'ghost' units from the Period 18-30 blackout. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, and pipeline_inventory includes these non-existent units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. To trigger an order that covers the next (L+1) periods (approx 360 units) while the backend subtracts ~1840 ghost units and some recent valid units, I calculate the target mu_hat as: Expected Demand (120 * 3) + Ghost Inventory (1840) + approx buffer for recent valid in-transit. Setting mu_hat to 2700 ensures the order quantity remains positive and sufficient to rebuild on-hand inventory, which is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P26-P43) stable at mean ~120 units. Ghost inventory of 1840 units from the P18-P30 blackout persists in system 'In-transit' metrics, necessitating continued mu_hat inflation to allow procurement.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-blackout with lead times between 1-3 periods. However, the 'In-transit' metric is severely contaminated by 1840 units (orders P18-P30) that never arrived and are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this false pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a (L+1) horizon (where L=3, so 4 periods of demand) and then add the 1840 ghost units to this total. Average demand since Period 26 is ~121. Base stock target = (3+1) * 121 + z*sigma \u2248 484 + safety stock. Total mu_hat \u2248 484 + 1840 = 2324. This allows the backend to see a 'requirement' that exceeds the phantom in-transit units, triggering necessary replenishment. Sigma is set based on recent volatility (approx 25 units per period).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 244 units following the arrival of P42 and P43 orders. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 2238 units; however, historical analysis confirms that approximately 1840 of these units (orders P18-P30) are 'ghost units' that never arrived during the supply chain blackout and must be disregarded. The true active pipeline consists of P44 (373 units) and P45 (0 units), for a total of 373 effective units in transit. Demand since Period 26 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 120-130 units. To bypass the backend's base-stock constraint caused by the 1840 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2-3 periods (3+1 = 4 periods of coverage) as 4 * 130 = 520 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1840 phantom units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 2400 (Target 520 + Ghost 1840 + safety). This allows the system to recognize the need for fresh inventory now that the lead time has stabilized to 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 120 units per period (Avg P26-P46 is ~121). The supply chain has recovered from the previous blackout, with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Recent: P40=3, P41=3, P42=3, P43=2). The primary challenge is the 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 1840 units from the P18-P30 blackout, which remains in the system calculation and prevents new orders because the backend sees (On-hand + In-transit) > base_stock. To bypass this, I continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it high enough to offset the ~1840 ghost units plus the required inventory for the lead time. Total In-transit is currently 2238. Legitimate in-transit includes P44 (373 units). Subtracting P44 from 2238 leaves 1865 ghost units. With a target cycle of (L+1)=3 periods at ~120 units/period, the base stock should be ~360. Adding 1865 ghost units to 360 results in a mu_hat target of ~2225 to trigger necessary procurement as on-hand stock (138) depletes.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized post-blackout with L between 1-3 periods. Ghost inventory from P18-P30 (approx 1840-1865 units) persists in 'In-transit' metric, requiring manual inflation of mu_hat to ensure continued procurement.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized post-blackout with lead times between 1 and 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P40-LT3, P41-LT3, P42-LT3, P43-LT2). Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 120 units (P26-P47 average is 120). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 2238 units; however, historical analysis confirms that approximately 1840-1865 units from orders P18-P30 are 'ghost units' that never arrived during the extended blackout and are unlikely to arrive now. To bypass the OR engine's logic, which subtracts this (mostly non-existent) pipeline from its order calculation, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the actual required stock (base stock) for a 3-period lead time plus 1-period review cycle (L+1=4) at 120 * 4 = 480 units. To trigger a new order despite the 2238 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 2600. This ensures the engine sees (2600 - 2238) = 362 units as needed, effectively clearing the ghost inventory constraint and maintaining availability for the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 123 units per period. The supply chain recovered in Period 32, with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average is ~2 since recovery). However, a 'ghost' pipeline of approximately 1840 units from orders placed between Period 18 and Period 30 remains in the system's in-transit metrics but will never arrive. To bypass this, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to ensure the OR engine places orders despite the high reported in-transit number. Since the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period cycle is around 370-400 units, and the system thinks we have 2600 units in transit, I set mu_hat to 3000 to force procurement of units needed to satisfy the current 123-unit/period demand. We are at Period 49 of 50, making this the final or semi-final order to cover remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory from Period 18-30 (approx 1840 units) persists through Period 48, requiring continued mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 120 units per period (average of P26-P49 is ~122). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost inventory' of approximately 1840 units from the P18-P30 supply chain blackout, which remains in the system's 'In-transit' metric (currently 3000 units, but actual active pipeline is only orders from P44-P49). Lead times have stabilized to 2-3 periods post-recovery (P40 arrived in 3, P41 in 3, P42 in 3, P43 in 2). To bypass the OR engine's in-transit constraint caused by the ghost units, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 2300. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand at the 120/period rate (~480 units for L=3) plus an inflation factor to neutralize the ~1840 ghost units, ensuring the backend places an order to replenish the current zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: P50: Lead time post-recovery has shifted slightly higher to a consistent 2-3 periods. Ghost inventory persists at ~1840 units, requiring mu_hat to be maintained at an inflated level (>2200) to trigger necessary replenishment.
