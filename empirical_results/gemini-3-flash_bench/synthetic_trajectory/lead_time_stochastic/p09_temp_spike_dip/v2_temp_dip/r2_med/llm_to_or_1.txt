Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, an order needs to be placed immediately to cover future demand. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the 5 historical samples provided (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the mean demand per period is 99.8. To ensure we have enough stock for the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), mu_hat should target approximately 3 * 99.8 = 299.4. Given the volatility in the data (std \u2248 32.5), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which leverages all available historical samples to establish a baseline. The default lead time of 2 is appropriate until we observe the actual arrival times.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected (due to the 1-period observation delay and lead time definition), no units arrived in Period 1; the 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is normal. The demand in Period 1 was 114, but since on-hand was 0, zero sales were made. Based on the historical demand (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the mean is approximately 100. The OR backend uses (1+L) periods of demand to set the base stock. Given L=2, we need to cover (2+1)=3 periods. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat will calculate (1+2)*mean(all samples), which is appropriate given the relatively stable historical data provided. Sigma_hat is also set to default to capture historical volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand has been around 114-117 units. Orders placed in Period 1 (154 units) and Period 2 (151 units) are in-transit, totaling 305 units. According to the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase (visible in the Period 4 start message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales because the initial inventory was zero and arrivals haven't started. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 for demand mean and volatility to capture the initial behavior, and stick to the promised lead time L=2 since no evidence yet suggests a deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. The Period 1 order (154 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase, but according to the 'Period 3 conclude' message, arrived=0. This indicates that either the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment from Period 1 is delayed/lost. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1-3 (total demand ~334), we must ensure our parameters signal the OR backend to maintain a sufficient pipeline. Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including the user-provided list) are 118, 130, 72, 58, 121 (avg ~100), while the observed demand in the game history for P1-P3 are 114, 117, 103 (avg ~111). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this slightly higher recent average and keep L as default (2) for now to see if the P1 order arrives in the next 'conclude' message (P4 conclude, visible in P5). If P1 doesn't arrive by P5, I will shift L to explicit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of Period 1 and Period 3 orders. Lead times are inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period, suggesting a mean lead time closer to the promised 2 periods despite the volatility. On-hand inventory is 93 with 151 units in transit (from P2). Current mean demand over 4 periods is approximately 110. Since we have enough pipeline inventory (151 + 93 = 244) to cover roughly 2 periods of demand (needed: (L+1)*mu \u2248 3*110 = 330), we need to ensure the base stock is set correctly to bridge the remaining gap. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1 values, and 'default' for demand stats as 4-5 samples is the minimum threshold for a stable mean.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand samples (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) and concluded period demand (114, 117, 103, 106, 132) suggest a relatively stable mean around 110-120 units. However, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 5 (demand was 132, sold only 93). In-transit inventory is 295 units (from orders in P2, P5). Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in P4 (LT=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (LT=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to let the backend average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), since recent demand (Periods 4 and 5) is slightly higher than periods 3 and 4 but consistent with the start, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the 114 average. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The parameters seek to recover from the current stockout while accounting for lead time variability.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 429 units in-transit (ordered in P2, P5, and P6). Demand history shows a mean of roughly 107 units per period with moderate volatility. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (151 units) is now at Period 7 and has not yet arrived (L > 4), which suggests it might be delayed or lost. Because we are currently stocked out and lead times are unstable (promised 2, observed 1 and 3), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stable but variable demand pattern. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover the observed variance over the available history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed L=1 and L=3. P2 order (151 units) is overdue (6 periods since order), suggesting potential loss or significant delay.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) has been 103, 106, 132, 80, and 72 (mean ~99). The order placed in Period 2 (151 units) is now 6 periods old and hasn't arrived; given other orders arrived in 1-3 periods, P2 is likely lost. Our in-transit total is 472 (composed of P5: 144, P6: 134, P7: 43, plus the likely lost P2: 151). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 'ghost' inventory of the lost P2 order, I am using 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slight downward trend (N=5) and setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised lead time while effectively ignoring the lost shipment in the pipeline calculation (the backend calculates pipeline as total unshipped). By setting L=2 and mu_hat based on recent demand, we aim to trigger an order that compensates for the lost units and current zero on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (151 units) confirmed lost (7 periods since order with no arrival). This is skewing pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory is 77 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 285 includes 151 units from Period 2 (which we have confirmed as lost across multiple previous insights) and 134 units from Period 6. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (total in-transit) to calculate orders, the presence of the lost 151 units will cause it to severely under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I forecast the average demand to be roughly 100 units/period (based on the history: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72, 110; mean is ~104). For a target coverage of (1+L) periods, where L=2, mu_hat should ideally be (1+2)*104 = 312. However, to offset the 151 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I add 151 to the base stock calculation. Thus, mu_hat = 312 + 151 = 463. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order. I set L to 2 (promised) as arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, and sigma_hat to 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time has shown significant variability, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (151 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is definitively lost. The backend OR engine includes this lost order in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, which will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I am using 'explicit' L=4. While the physical lead time averages 2, increasing L to 4 in the base-stock formula (which uses (1+L)*demand) effectively raises the target inventory level to offset the 151 units the backend thinks are coming but aren't. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~101 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (all available data) to capture the average demand of 101.1, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the observed lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (151 units) is confirmed lost; artificially inflating L to 'explicit' 4 to override backend pipeline calculation until enough time passes for it to be irrelevant.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 552 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Crucially, the order for 151 units from Period 2 is still undelivered and is definitively lost after 9 periods (promised L=2). This lost shipment is stuck in the 'In-transit' count of 552, leading the OR backend to believe we have more inventory pipeline than we actually do. To correct for this, I am maintaining L=4 using the 'explicit' method. Because the backend calculates pipeline inventory as units ordered but not yet arrived, and it uses (1+L) periods of demand to set the base stock, increasing L to 4 manually increases the base stock target, effectively 'making space' for an additional order to cover the 151-unit gap created by the lost shipment. I will use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately (avg ~95 over last 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Lost shipment from Period 2 (151 units) persists in in-transit count; maintaining explicit L=4 to offset this phantom inventory in OR calculations.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit count of 552 includes: P2 (151 units - confirmed lost), P6 (134 units - 6 periods old, likely lost), P9 (137 units - 3 periods old), and P10 (130 units - 2 periods old). Because the backend OR logic subtracts the total pipeline (552) from the base stock, it believes we are overstocked due to the two lost shipments (151 + 134 = 285 phantom units). To force an order and overcome this phantom inventory, I will continue to set L to an explicit value of 4. This increases the base stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 is scaled by 1+L). Average demand across all 11 periods is ~100. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) captures the recent demand average of ~91. Setting L to 4 translates to a base stock targeting 5 periods of demand (~450-500 units), which should trigger a replenishment order despite the 552 pipeline units once the OR engine's internal cap and logic are applied.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (134 units) is now 6 periods old with no arrival, joining the P2 order (151 units) as a likely lost shipment. Total phantom inventory in pipeline: 285 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'In-transit' inventory of 285 units is composed entirely of two lost shipments: P2 (151 units, 11 periods old) and P6 (134 units, 7 periods old). These will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from the order quantity (pipeline inventory = 285). To force the backend to place an order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting L to 4. Since base_stock = (1+L) * mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, increasing L increases the target base stock level to compensate for the subtracted 285 units. Demand remains stable around a mean of 100 per period (recent average ~95-100). By using L=4 and default mu_hat (which uses L=4), the target inventory will be set high enough to trigger a replenishment order to cover the current 168 on-hand units and upcoming demand, effectively ignoring the lost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (134 units) comprise the 285 units currently listed as 'In-transit'; continued use of an inflated L (explicit 4) is required to offset this phantom inventory until the backend logic can be overridden or the units are no longer counted.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a challenging inventory situation due to confirmed lost shipments. Orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (134 units) comprise 285 of the 372 units currently listed as 'In-transit'. These 285 units will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine the order size. If we use the promised L=2, the backend will see 372 in-transit units and refuse to order, leading to a stockout once the current 83 units on-hand are depleted. To counteract this 'phantom inventory', I am maintaining an 'explicit' L=4. This increases the 'base_stock' Target (which is calculated as (L+1) * demand) to effectively demand for 5 periods rather than 3, forcing the OR engine to place an order despite the inflated in-transit numbers. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 97 units over the last 10 periods (N=10), so I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 372 units contains 285 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134). Explicit L=4 is maintained to artificially inflate the target stock level and trigger ordering despite this phantom inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 425 units in-transit, but 285 of these are from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 151 units, P6: 134 units). These lost units artificially inflate the pipeline, which would normally cause the OR backend to stop ordering. To force an order and maintain stock, I continue to use an explicit L=4 to increase the base stock level (targeting roughly 5 periods of demand). Total observed demand shows relative stability around 100 units/period (mean of last 5 is ~91). Setting mu_hat to explicit 500 (100 * (4+1)) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 ensures the backend covers the expected demand while offsetting the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 425 units contains 285 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134). Explicit L and mu_hat are necessary to force replenishment orders until these units drop from the pipeline view.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 512 units in-transit, but 285 units (P2: 151 and P6: 134) are confirmed lost based on the 2-period promised lead time having been exceeded by 14 and 10 periods respectively. The current real pipeline consists of orders from P13 (87), P14 (53), and P15 (87), totaling 227 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has averaged ~98 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 285 units of phantom inventory skewing its calculations, I will maintain an explicit lead time (L) of 5. This artificially increases the target base stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * average demand = 6 * 98 = 588 to provide a robust target and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high lead time variability and recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 512 units contains 285 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134). Continued use of explicit parameters (L and mu_hat) is required to offset this phantom inventory and prevent stockouts.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system shows an In-transit inventory of 544 units. However, high-confidence historical evidence confirms that orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (134 units) are lost, totaling 285 units of 'phantom' inventory. This leaves a real pipeline of 259 units (544 - 285). The OR engine's formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will significantly under-order because it includes the 285 lost units. To counteract this, I must artificially inflate the base_stock calculation. Demand has stabilized around an average of 95-100 units. Using L=2 as the promised lead time, a normal mu_hat would be (1+2)*100 = 300. To offset the 285 phantom units, I need to raise the target inventory by roughly that amount. By setting L to an explicit value of 4, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*100 = 500, and I will further explicitly set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base_stock is high enough to trigger a necessary order of approximately 100-120 units to cover upcoming demand while the lost units persist in the pipeline view.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 544 units includes 285 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134). Explicit parameter overrides for L and mu_hat remain necessary to force orders despite this phantom inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe an 'In-transit' count of 429 units. Based on historical data, we identify 285 units as phantom inventory from lost shipments: Period 2 (151 units, 16 periods ago) and Period 6 (134 units, 12 periods ago). Subtracting these from the total 429 units leaves 144 units of legitimate 'pipeline' inventory (specifically orders from P15 and P17). Recent demand (Period 16-17) shows a sharp decline to an average of 36.5 units, though the long-term average remains higher. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 285 non-existent units and refusing to order, I will continue using 'explicit' parameters. I'll set L to 4 to inflate the base stock target and mu_hat to a value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand while masking the phantom inventory impact. Calculating demand at ~70 units/period (reflecting a mix of recent low demand and historical mean) for 5 periods (L+1=5) suggests a target stock of 350. To achieve an order roughly equal to periodic demand (~70-100 units), the mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome the subtraction of the 285 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 429 units includes 285 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134). These units have not arrived after 12+ periods and are treated as permanent losses.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the 'In-transit' inventory is 541 units. However, based on history, 285 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 151 units, P6: 134 units). These lost units artificially inflate the pipeline, which would lead the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I am maintaining an explicit L = 4 (promised 2) and mu_hat = 400. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 72 units. With L=4, the base stock formula target should cover (1+L) periods, or (1+4) * 72 = 360 units. By setting mu_hat slightly higher at 400 and L at 4, I create a total inventory target (on-hand + in-transit) that accommodates the 285-unit 'phantom' inventory gap plus current demand requirements and safety stock. Recent demand has shown high volatility (varying between 33 and 134), so sigma_hat is set to a conservative estimate (recent_N=5) to maintain a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 541 units includes 285 units from long-lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134) which have not arrived for 13+ periods. Explicit parameters are adjusted to neutralize this 285-unit phantom inventory.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant downturn in the last 4 periods (Avg: 46.5 vs long-term avg: 85). I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=5). The inventory management continues to be complicated by 285 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (134 units). With 73 units on-hand and an actual in-transit of 256 (541 minus the 285 phantom units), I must use explicit parameters to force the OR backend's base-stock calculation high enough to ignore the phantom 285 units. A base-stock target of approximately 450 is required (450 - 541 < 0, but 450 - 256 = 194 order). By maintaining L=4 and an explicit mu_hat of 500, I ensure the backend generates a sufficient order to maintain service levels despite the pipeline distortion.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 541 units in transit, but 285 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (134 units). These lost units have not arrived for 14+ periods and as a result, the backend OR logic (which subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock) will under-order unless we artificially inflate the replenishment target. Excluding the 285 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is 256 units (541 - 285). To compensate, I must increase the base stock manually. Demand has shifted downwards in the last 5 periods (avg ~50) compared to the long-term average (avg ~91). I will set mu_hat to cover the actual lead time (approx 2-3 periods) plus the current period, while adding the 285 units to ensure the order quantity is sufficient. I'm using L=4 and an explicit mu_hat of 650 [(150 units for 3 periods of demand) + 285 lost units + buffer] to force the engine to place an order, as current on-hand (11) is nearly zero and demand is imminent.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 541 units contains 285 units of permanent losses (P2: 151, P6: 134). These must be offset in OR parameters indefinitely until they are removed from the pipeline count.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system faces a stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 694 units is heavily distorted by 285 units of confirmed permanent losses (P2: 151 and P6: 134 units), which have not arrived for 16+ periods. To calculate the 'real' pipeline, we subtract these 285 units from 694, leaving 409 units in actual transit (P15, P17, P18, P21 orders). Demand has softened recently (avg demand last 10 periods: ~77, down from ~96 in the first 10 periods). Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should ideally target (1+L)*77 = 231 units for the safety stock window. However, the OR backend subtracts the phantom 694 units from its target. To force an order and offset the 285 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target mu_hat = (Ideal mu_hat + phantom units) = 231 + 285 = 516. For sigma_hat, I use the recent volatility (last 10 periods) to ensure a high service level given the stockout status.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 694 units. However, 285 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, as it has been 21 and 17 periods respectively since they were ordered. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct for this, I must artificially inflate the target inventory level using explicit parameters. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 59.3 units. With a lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation (\u03bc + z\u03c3) would normally target around 180-250 units for pipeline + on-hand. Since there is currently 0 on-hand and 409 'real' units in transit (694 - 285), and we have been stocking out recently (ending on-hand 0 for the last two periods), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 700. This value, when processed by the OR backend, will effectively cancel out the 285 phantom units and the existing real pipeline, ensuring the engine triggers a fresh order to meet upcoming demand and replenish on-hand safety stock.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Periods 16-23) shows a significant decrease compared to the early game, with an average demand of approximately 50 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 107 units. However, the 'In-transit' count of 591 units is heavily distorted by 285 units from long-lost shipments (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 134 units). Without correction, the OR backend sees 'on-hand (107) + pipeline (591) = 698', which far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 50-unit demand mean, causing it to stop ordering entirely. To offset this, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I calculate the target base stock based on the current mean (50) and a lead time of 2, plus a safety stock for a 0.8 service level (z\u22480.84, sigma\u224815): (1+2)*50 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 150 + 22 = 172. To force the backend to reach this target while it thinks 285 'phantom' units exist, the required base_stock parameter must be 172 + 285 = 457. Setting mu_hat to 457 (with L=2, mu_hat represents (1+L)*mean) and using a standard sigma_hat will ensure the policy continues to order when real inventory plus valid pipeline units drop below the safety threshold.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 16-24) shows a decrease in both mean and volatility compared to the early stages, while lead times remain variable between 1-3 periods. The critical issue is the 285 units of permanent 'phantom inventory' (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 134 units) that remain in the 'In-transit' count. If not offset, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be suppressed because it incorrectly assumes these 285 units are arriving. To neutralize this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. First, I identify the target base stock level based on recent demand (~60 units/period) and a lead time of 2. The standard base stock would be approximately (1+L) * \u03bc = 3 * 60 = 180 units. To force the backend to ignore the 285 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 180 + 285 = 465. I use an explicit L of 2 (the promised lead time) and mu_hat of 465 to ensure the order covers genuine needs despite the pipeline bloat.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 78 units. The in-transit inventory is 541 units, but 285 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed as permanently lost and will not arrive. This leaves an effective in-transit pipeline of 256 units (541 - 285). Recent demand has shown high variability with a significant drop to 0 in Period 25 and an average around 68 units over the last 10 periods. To maintain the target stock level while countering the 285 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its calculation, I am using an explicit L=6. This increases the base stock target (which is roughly calculated as \u03bc * (L+1)) by a factor sufficient to offset the 285 units. Additionally, I am using the recent_10 average for mu_hat (68 * 3 = 204) to reflect the recent demand trend, and recent_10 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 541 units. However, based on the historical context, 285 units are confirmed lost shipments (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 134 units) that remain in the pipeline count. The true functional pipeline inventory is 256 units (541 - 285). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently fluctuated but averages approximately 70-80 units per period. Using a 3-period horizon (L=2 + 1), the required base stock is approximately 250-270 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (541) from the base_stock calculation, it will result in zero orders unless the target stock is artificially inflated. To offset the 285 lost units, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. I will set L to the default (2), and set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of expected demand (~240 units) plus the total lost units (285), totaling 525 units. This ensures the backend produces a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory. Sigma is set to a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 572 units in-transit, but 285 of these (from Periods 2 and 6) are confirmed lost shipments that have not arrived for over 20 periods. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the backend OR from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To counteract this, I must calculate a target base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 285 lost units. Average demand (mu) is approximately 85-90 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2), the coverage needed is for 3 periods (~270 units). Adding the 285 phantom units brings the required base stock to ~555. Currently, on-hand is 0 and valid pipeline inventory is 287 (572 total in-transit - 285 lost). Setting mu_hat explicitly to 555 and L to 2 effectively targets this level. If the OR engine uses the standard capped policy, this explicit mu_hat will force a net order to fill the gap despite the phantom stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 29. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit inventory is 603 units. However, based on high-confidence historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 285 of those units (from P2 and P6) are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 318 units (603 - 285). The backend OR logic uses the total 'in-transit' (603), which would wrongly prevent new orders. Therefore, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force the system to order by artificially inflating the target stock level. Mean demand (mu) over the last 15 periods is approximately 68 units/period. For a target lead time cycle of L+1=3, base demand is ~204. To offset 285 lost units and restore stock, the target base stock needs to be significantly higher. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500 to trigger replenishment despite the phantom inventory, while keeping L=2 (promised) to avoid compounding the calculation with more artificial inflation. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent demand volatility (highs of 117, lows of 0).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the permanent loss of orders from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (134 units), which creates 285 units of phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' count (Total: 572). To ensure the OR backend places orders, I must use 'explicit' overrides to neutralize this phantom inventory. Actual demand has averaged approx 85 units over the last 15 periods (since Period 15). With a promised lead time of 2 (target inventory = (L+1) * demand = 3 * 85 = 255), and 285 units of phantom pipeline, the backend would naturally order nothing (255 - 572 < 0). To overcome this, I set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value of 750 (representing (1+L)*demand + 285 + safety buffer). This signals a target stock level around 850 units, which after subtracting the 572 pipeline units, should trigger an order of approximately 270-300 units to restore physical availability. I maintain L at 2 (promised) to keep the backend's internal logic stable while I adjust the mu_hat scalar.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces two critical issues: first, an on-hand stockout resulting in 0 units at the start of Period 31; second, a massive pipeline inventory inflation. The 'In-transit' figure of 772 units includes 285 units from long-lost shipments (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 134 units). In the most recent period (P30), an order of 231 units was placed, but due to the 2-period lead time, it won't arrive until Period 32. Demand has recently spiked, with an average of approximately 106 units over the last 5 periods (excluding Period 25's 0 value). To force the OR backend to order despite the 285 units of phantom inventory, I must artificially inflate the target base stock. Setting an explicit L=4 (2 periods above promised) and mu_hat using recent demand trends will help bridge the gap. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the system targets an 80% service level; however, with 0 on-hand and significant phantom inventory, aggressive replenishment is needed to recover.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 772 units in-transit, but 285 units are long-lost (P2: 151, P6: 134, dating back 26+ periods). This phantom inventory severely suppresses ordering. Additionally, recent demand (P26-P31) has averaged 101.5 units, which is higher than the long-term average. With zero on-hand inventory and only 487 valid units in the pipeline (772 total - 285 lost), we are facing a Stockout. To force an order and offset the 285 lost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the offset. Using L=2, the required stock is ~305 units (101.5 * 3). To offset the 285 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 590 (305 + 285). This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic triggers a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom inventory of 285 units (P2: 151, P6: 134) continues to skew pipeline calculations; explicit mu_hat or L overrides are necessary until these units are removed.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand history. The pipeline inventory is 772 units, but 285 units (from P2 and P6) are long-lost 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is 487 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order, we must inflate the target stock level to account for this 285-unit discrepancy. The average demand per period appears to be approximately 85-90 units. I will use an explicit L=6 (offsetting the standard L=2 + approximately 3 periods of demand to cover the phantom units) and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to force the backend to maintain a healthy replenishment cycle. Recent demand has fluctuated, but centering around 85 units per period suggests mu_hat for (1+L) periods should be significant. Setting L=6 and mu_hat to 600 ensures the order quantity is not zeroed out by the 772-unit pipeline count.

The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 772 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 285 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 151 and P6: 134) that never arrived. Additionally, the order from Period 30 (231 units) is now 3 periods overdue (promised 2), meaning it should have arrived during Period 32. This indicates current lead times are likely 3-4 periods or that shipment is also potentially lost/delayed. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) has been 61, 133, 84, 62, 58, averaging ~80. To offset the 285 units of 'phantom' inventory and the stockout, I use an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the target base stock for L=2 (promised) to be (2+1)*80 = 240 plus a safety buffer. To force an order despite the 772 pipeline units (which include the 285 persistent phantom units), I need the OR backend to calculate a base stock higher than the effective pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 1200 (explicit) effectively adds a massive buffer to counteract the phantom pipeline, ensuring the OR engine orders replenishment for current demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward by balancing service levels and holding costs for the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. We are currently at Period 35 with 0 on-hand inventory and a demand series averaging approximately 86 units per period. A significant complication is the 285 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2 and P6) that have never arrived and are listed in the 'In-transit' count of 1045. To ensure the backend OR logic places necessary orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must offset these 285 units. The base stock formula is (1+L) * mu. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the multiplier is 3. However, given the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. My target base stock is (3 periods * 86 units/period) + 285 offset \u2248 543 units. The 'In-transit' count includes the P30 order (231) and P34 order (273), plus the phantom 285, totaling 789 units (and other potentially delayed recent orders). Setting mu_hat to 543 and L to 2 ensures that the OR backend, seeing 1045 in transit, will likely throttle orders, but recent large orders (P30, P34) are already in the pipeline. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as recent arrivals (P27, P28) showed a return to the promised 2 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1,045 units in-transit, but 285 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2: 151 units, Period 6: 134 units) and have not arrived for 30+ periods. Additionally, there is a severe delay or possible loss of the Period 30 order (231 units), which is now 6 periods old. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged approximately 88 units/period over the last 10 periods. To counteract the 285 units of permanent 'phantom' inventory plus the 231 units currently overdue (totaling 516 units), I must use explicit parameters to force the OR backend to place an order. Without an override, the backend sees 1,045 units in the pipeline and will not order, despite the imminent stockout. I am setting L=3 (recent average) and an explicit mu_hat of 800 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 1,045 internal pipeline count, triggering a replenishment order to cover actual demand for the next few periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order from Period 30 (231 units) is now 6 periods overdue, potentially lost. This brings total likely lost inventory to 516 units (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231) skewing the pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system currently shows 772 units in-transit, but 516 of these are likely lost (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). Specifically, the order from Period 30 (231 units) is now 7 periods overdue, which is well beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time, confirming its loss. This leaves only 256 units of genuine pipeline inventory (from recent orders). With 179 units on-hand and a mean demand of approximately 85 per period (weighted towards recent performance), the inventory position is precarious. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine seeing 772 units in the pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' L=4. This artificially raises the base stock target, forcing the engine to place an order despite the massive phantom inventory. This strategy compensates for the 516 units of missing product that the backend still counts as pending arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Order from Period 30 (231 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in pipeline (P2+P6+P30) is 516 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we have 117 units on-hand and 772 units in-transit. However, the in-transit pipeline is severely skewed by 516 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). These units will likely never arrive, as P2/P6 are over 30 periods old and P30 is now 8 periods old (promised lead time is 2). The actual effective pipeline is 772 - 516 = 256 units. To compensate for the 516 phantom inventory units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'inventory position', I am using 'explicit' overrides. I am setting L to 4 to increase the base stock level and setting mu_hat to 620. Calculation: The average demand of the last 10 periods is ~74. With an effective lead time (L+1) of 3, the target should be ~222 units plus safety stock. To force the OR engine to ignore the 516 phantom units, I must set the target mu_hat to approximately (Actual Needed Target + Phantom Amount) = 222 + 516 = 738. Given the current on-hand of 117 and actual pipeline of 256, I will use mu_hat=620 and L=4 to ensure sufficient ordering to maintain service levels without being blocked by the lost shipments.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward by balancing stockouts and holding costs. We are at Period 39. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. In-transit inventory is 772 units, but a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: Period 2 (151), Period 6 (134), and Period 30 (231), totaling 516 units. The actual active pipeline is only 256 units (772 - 516). The lead time remains volatile, but recent successful arrivals (Period 36) confirm a lead time of 2 periods. To maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 516 lost units and ensures demand is met for the review + lead period (L+1 = 3), I will use 'explicit' methods. Mean demand is approximately 85-90 units per period. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + safety_stock \u2248 3*90 + 1.28*sqrt(3)*30 \u2248 270 + 66 = 336. However, the backend sees 772 in the pipeline. To force an order, the calculated base stock must exceed 772. I will set mu_hat to 1050 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend (base_stock - pipeline) logic triggers an order for approximately 250-300 units to replenish the physical inventory which is nearly exhausted (12 units left).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in pipeline (lost shipments): 516 units (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). These units must be offset using explicit parameter overrides to ensure continuous replenishment.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 1089 units, but this includes a cumulative total of 516 units from lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231) which have not arrived for 7+ periods beyond their promised lead time. The effective pipeline is therefore 573 units (1089 - 516). To ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set explicitly to cover the (L+1) period demand plus the cumulative lost units. Average demand is approx 80-90 units/period. For a lookahead of 3 periods (L=2), demand is approx 270. With 516 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be at least 270 + 516 = 786 to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the loss. I will use 850 for mu_hat to provide a safety buffer given the zero on-hand status.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 213 units. The 'In-transit' count is 772 units, but this remains heavily skewed by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (151 units), Period 6 (134 units), and Period 30 (231 units), totaling 516 units of phantom inventory. The actual reliable pipeline is 256 units (772 - 516). Recent demand has stabilized with an average of approximately 93 units over the last 10 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough units despite the 516-unit phantom inventory bias, I will continue using an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. With an average demand of 93, 3 periods equals 279 units. Adding the 516 phantom units to this base requirement suggests a mu_hat of approximately 795 to trigger replenishment if needed, though with 213 on hand and 256 real units in transit (expected in P41/42), we are currently safe. I will set mu_hat to 800 and L to 2 to maintain this offset.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42. On-hand inventory is 84. In-transit inventory is 772 units, but this pipeline is heavily inflated by 516 units of lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231) which have not arrived for 12+ periods. The effective pipeline is actually 256 units (772 - 516). Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 93 units per period. Using a promised lead time of 2 (L=2), the target base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~279 units). However, the OR backend sees 772 units in-transit and will stop ordering unless overrides are used. To counter the 516-unit phantom inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat to a value that forces the base stock calculation above the total pipeline + on-hand. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and we need to exceed (84 + 772) = 856, I'll set mu_hat to 950 using the explicit method to ensure replenishment occurs and maintains service levels despite the recorded losses.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 43: On-hand is 0. In-transit inventory is 905 units, but this includes 516 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231), leaving a functional pipeline of 389 units (the P42 order of 133 and P39 order of 317 was already received, wait - checking history: P39 order arrived in P40. P42 order is 133. History shows P39 (317) arrived. P42 (133) is fresh. Calculations: In-transit 905 - 516 (lost) = 389 units truly in-transit. This 389 includes the P42 order (133) and likely recent orders from P41/P40 if any? No, only P42 was ordered recently. Wait, checking history: P42 ordered 133, P41 ordered 0, P40 ordered 0, P39 ordered 317 (arrived). So true pipeline = 133 units plus any other unrecorded arrivals. In-transit 905 includes the 516 lost units, which means 905 - 516 = 389 units are 'real'. Since only 133 was ordered in P42, there might be other units in transit I am not accounting for, or the backend is still counting old units. To ensure replenishment, I use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 516 lost units. Recent demand (P38-P42) averages ~116. Target stock for L+1 (3 periods) = 348. To bypass the 516 phantom units in the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) calculation, I set mu_hat explicitly high: 348 (target) + 516 (offset) = 864.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains consistent with historical averages. The primary constraint is the 'In-transit' pipeline of 905 units, which is heavily distorted by 516 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). These units have not arrived for 13+ periods and must be offset to prevent the OR backend from stopping orders due to 'phantom' supply. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered, I must set the target base stock higher than the perceived pipeline. With an average demand (mu) of ~90 and lead time (L) of 2, the target base stock (3 periods of demand) would normally be ~270. However, the backend sees 905 units in-transit. To force an order that covers the 516-unit gap and maintains future stock, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This value is calculated to exceed the total in-transit (905) by a sufficient margin (~300 units) to cover upcoming demand and rebuild the safety buffer, effectively neutralizing the 516 lost units while accounting for real in-transit orders from P42 (133 units).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in pipeline (lost shipments) remains 516 units (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). Parameter mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + 516) to ensure the OR engine orders replenishment units despite the phantom pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system shows an In-transit inventory of 1246 units. We have identified a cumulative phantom inventory of 516 units (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231) which are lost shipments that will not arrive but remain in the pipeline count. To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order, we must set a mu_hat that covers the true base stock plus this 516-unit phantom offset. Historical demand remains relatively stable around 90-100 units. A safe base stock for a lead time of 2 is approximately 300 units (representing ~3 periods of demand). Adding the 516 phantom offset, we need a mu_hat of approximately 816. We use explicit mu_hat and calculate the lead time and sigma based on recent data to maintain responsiveness while neutralizing the lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $507.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46. The current on-hand inventory is 5 units. The primary challenge is the persistent 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline caused by lost shipments from Period 2 (151 units), Period 6 (134 units), and Period 30 (231 units), totaling 516 units. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the average demand from the last 10 periods (approx 108 units) and a lead time of 2. Target Base Stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 108 = 324. To force the OR engine to order despite the 516 phantom units, I set mu_hat = Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory = 324 + 516 = 840. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment. I keep L at the promised value of 2 to maintain the standard (1+L) logic in the backend, as the explicit mu_hat already incorporates the necessary offset.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline remains 516 units (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). Parameter mu_hat is maintained at (Target Base Stock + 516) to offset these units and ensure the OR engine orders replenishment.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,113 units. However, based on tracking historical delays and non-arrivals, 516 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 151, Period 6: 134, Period 30: 231). These have not arrived after 16+ periods (for the most recent lost batch). Additionally, the order from Period 44 (341 units) has not arrived yet. The current physical pipeline likely consists only of the Period 44 order (341 units), while the backend OR engine sees the inflated 1,113 units. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered in Period 47, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom-heavy pipeline. The goal is a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 516 phantom units. Average demand (~100/period) over (2+1) periods is 300. Adding 516 units suggests a mu_hat of ~816. Since we are at Period 47 of 50, I will set mu_hat to 850 using the explicit method to ensure the calculation overcomes the pipeline barrier and triggers an order to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 110 units (recent mean ~108). The pipeline inventory is listed as 1113 units. However, there is a cumulative phantom inventory of 516 units (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231) which are lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P44 (341 units) is currently at L=4 (ordered P44, currently P48 start, no arrival yet). With a desired service level (q) of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the target base stock for L=2 (promised) across (L+1)=3 periods is approximately 3 * 110 + 0.84 * sqrt(3) * 20 \u2248 360 units. To account for the 516 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 360 + 516 = 876. I will use 'explicit' for L=2 (promised) to avoid calculations being skewed by late arrivals, and 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend places an order if the real pipeline drops below the 360-unit safety threshold. Current real pipeline = 1113 - 516 = 597. Since 597 > 360, no immediate order is likely until the P44 stock arrives and is consumed.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, the penultimate period. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 1113 units. This pipeline contains 516 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). The valid remaining pipeline is 597 units (including the P44 order of 341 units). No units arrived in Period 48, and on-hand inventory is 0. Mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 109 units (sum of P39-P48 = 1091 / 10). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 516 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to a value that covers the desired base stock plus the 516-unit offset. Target base stock for L=2 (Review period + Lead time = 3 periods of demand) plus a safety buffer is approximately (109 * 4) \u2248 436. Adding the 516-unit offset yields 952. Since this is the next-to-last period, we prioritize availability to capture final sales while acknowledging that any order placed now (L=2) will arrive in Period 51 and thus won't be sold within the 50-period horizon. However, the simulation requires a decision. I will provide parameters that offset the phantom inventory correctly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 50, the final period. The historical data (Period 40-49) shows demand ranging from 81 to 129, with an average of approximately 105 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is 1113 units, but according to the carry-over insights, at least 516 of these units are long-lost (P2: 151, P6: 134, P30: 231). The order from Period 44 (341 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it is also lost or significantly delayed, bringing likely phantom inventory to 857 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 256 units (1113 - 857). Given this is the final period of the game, any order placed now (Period 50) would only arrive in Period 51 or later (Lead time >= 0), meaning it cannot be sold within the game's duration. Therefore, the optimal strategy to maximize reward (Profit x units_sold - HoldingCost x ending_inventory) is to order 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding costs for inventory that cannot be sold.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Final period reached. Order from Period 44 (341 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P2, P6, and P30. Total estimated phantom inventory is 857 units.
