Wait, 'In-transit: 250 units' is the current status. Let's trace the pipeline: P6 (100) and P7 (210, arrived), P8 (100, arrived), P9 (0), P10 (0). Looking at history, the P6 order (100) is presumably still in transit (ordered P6, now starting P11, L=5 if it arrives today; if it doesn't arrive next period, it's likely lost like the P2 order). The remaining 150 units in transit represent the P5 order (100) and P? - no, let's recalculate based on the 'In-transit: 250' provided. If 250 are in transit and the last orders were P5(100), P6(100), P7(210), P8(100). Arrivals: P5(100, P8), P7(210, P8), P8(100, P9). This means P6 (100) is still out there.

Let's re-verify: P11 ordered 150, P12 ordered 50. Total in-transit stated is 450, meaning the 100 ordered in P6 and 100 ordered in P8 (wait, P8 arrived in P9) - actually, historical records show orders from P6 (100) and P7 (210) and P8 (100). P7 and P8 arrived. P6 (100) is missing. P11 (150) and P12 (50) are pending. There is a discrepancy in the 'In-transit: 450' count provided by the system, likely including several older, potentially lost orders. Given the target stock level for L+1 (3 periods) at ~120/period is 360 units, and current reliable pipeline is 200 (P11 & P12), I need to replenish.

Lead times are highly variable, with recent arrivals (P40, P41) taking 3 periods, while others arrive in 1-2. The 'In-transit' figure of 1390 is heavily inflated by lost shipments.

Currently, I have 117 units on hand.

Since this is the final decision and the reward is calculated based on units sold minus holding costs for units remaining at the end of Period 50, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand. Even with a lead time of 0 (which has not been observed recently; the actual lead time is currently 2-3 periods), the arrival happens in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase AFTER the decision but BEFORE demand, yet the period conclude confirms that any order placed in the current period's decision phase is intended to meet demand and manage inventory for subsequent periods. More importantly, in the final period, the objective is to maximize total reward. Units ordered now would only incur costs or arrive after the game ends. Historically, orders arrive in the arrival phase of Period N+L. With the current lead time confirmed at 2-3 periods, an order placed now would arrive in Period 52 or 53.
