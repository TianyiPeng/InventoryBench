Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 1. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) has a mean of 99.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no inventory on hand or in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time = 2), mu_hat (calculated as (1+2)*99.8 = 299.4), and sigma_hat (based on historical standard deviation). This will trigger an initial order to cover current and lead-time demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 2. According to the mechanics, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because we started with 0 and the first order hasn't arrived yet, leading to lost sales in Period 1. The historical demand samples (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) show a mean of approximately 99.8. Period 1's actual demand was 89, which is within the historical range. Since there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting, I will use 'default' (all historical samples) to stabilize the base stock calculation, as one period of observation (89) isn't enough to confirm a regime shift from the historical average (~100).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (154 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2. Total in-transit is 301 units (154 from P1 + 147 from P2). Historical demand samples are [118, 130, 72, 58, 121]. Note: The 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 report different demand values (89 and 41) than the global samples provided (118 and 130); I will prioritize the provided historical sample mean for forecasting while acknowledging early stockouts. Since L=2, the backend needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Mean demand of all samples is ~99.8. I will use 'default' for mu_hat to capture the full sample mean across 3 periods (target ~300).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (154 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than the promised 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0 and all demand so far has been lost. Historical demand (89, 41, 91) shows high volatility. Since we haven't seen a single arrival yet, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increased lead time (L+1=4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1679.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) is volatile: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in only 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is currently 2.0 ((3+1)/2). Inventory status: On-hand is 126. Total in-transit is 167 (from Period 2 order of 147 and Period 4 order of 20). Period 2 order is currently at L=3 relative to today (placed P2, it should have arrived in P4 if L=2, or P5 if L=3). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the backend to average these observations. Demand has fluctuated (89, 41, 91, 95) with a mean of 79. Since recent demand (P3, P4) is higher than the early average, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current trend (~76 per period) and its variance, ensuring consistent coverage for the (L+1) window.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the order and arrival history to set parameters. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Reviewing 'conclude' messages: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3), and Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). Period 2's order (147 units) is still in transit (currently overdue if L=2). Since we have seen lead times of 1 and 3, the average is 2. The demand mean over the first 5 periods is approximately 82.6 units/period (89, 41, 91, 95, 97). However, the last three periods show a more stable and higher average of 94.3. Given the current on-hand inventory is low (29) and one large order (Period 2) is missing, I will stick to the default lead time of 2 but use recent_N for demand to capture the recent higher stability (94+ units). This helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P3-P6) around a mean of 94.75, which is higher than the initial samples. Lead times are volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (averaging 2, matching the promised lead time). The current in-transit (276 units) consists of orders from P2 (ordered 147, now 5 periods ago - likely lost), P4 (ordered 20, now 3 periods ago), and P5 (ordered 109, now 2 periods ago). Since P2 is significantly past the promised lead time and has not arrived, it is likely lost. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the current stable regime (N=4) and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (observed 1 and 3 periods); Order from Period 2 (147 units) is likely lost as it is 3 periods past promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 356 units in-transit. Lead times have been highly volatile: 3 periods (P1 order), 1 period (P3 order), and 3 periods (P4 order). The P2 order (147 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost; I will adjust the pipeline expectation by treating this as a loss. Demand is relatively stable, with the last 4 periods averaging 100 units (95, 97, 96, 112). Given the lead time volatility and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longer observed delivery times. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the slight uptick in demand, while using explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer against both demand variance and lead-time uncertainty, ensuring the OR backend triggers a sufficiently large order to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (147 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order, 4 periods past promise). Lead time is established as 3 periods for planning purposes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1591.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 119 and in-transit inventory of 266. Historical lead times have been inconsistent, ranging between 1 and 3 periods (P1 ordered/P4 arrived = 3; P3/P4 = 1; P4/P7 = 3; P5/P8 = 3; P7/P8 = 1). The order from Period 2 (147 units) is definitely lost. Since the most common 'long' lead time is 3, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers a sufficient lead time horizon. Demand has stabilised recently around 100 units; the mean of the last 5 samples is (95+97+96+112+90)/5 = 98. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 captures this current regime. The in-transit units (266) plus on-hand (119) total 385, which should be compared against a base stock targeting (L+1) sessions of demand (~392 units), likely resulting in a small supplementary order to maintain the service level across the inferred 3-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2582.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current on-hand inventory is 97. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 182, which includes the order from Period 2 (147 units) that is considered lost, and the order from Period 9 (35 units). Since the Period 2 order is lost, the effective pipeline inventory is only 35 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). I will set L to 3 to be conservative against stockouts given the volatility. Demand in Period 9 was 141, significantly higher than the previous average. I will use the last 5 periods of demand to capture this recent increase in mean and volatility (Average ~107). By setting L=3, mu_hat (1+L=4 periods) will be based on the recent 5-period average, and sigma_hat will adjust for the higher variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 9 demand (141) is the highest recorded, 40% above the long-term mean. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 starts with 0 on-hand inventory. The order from Period 2 (147 units) is confirmed lost, and several other orders (Periods 9 and 10) are in transit. Observed lead times have been highly volatile (1 and 3 periods), though the promised lead time is 2. Specifically, orders from P4, P5, and P8 arrived after 1 or 3 periods, suggesting an average near the promised 2, but with high variance. Demand has increased recently, with Period 9 (141) and Period 10 (100) averaging 120, compared to the initial mean of roughly 100. Because on-hand is zero and we have 324 units in-transit (P9=35, P10=142, and likely the ghost order of P2=147 which should be ignored by the OR backend logic if possible, though the OR engine sees 'pipeline'), I will set an explicit lead time of 2 to match the promised expectation while using recent_N for demand (N=5) to capture the upward trend (avg ~108). Sigma is set to explicit because current volatility is high and we need to buffer against stockouts given the 0 inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shift: Last 5 periods average 107.8 vs initial average of ~91. Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following two periods of stockouts (Periods 10 and 11), despite a high demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm that the Period 2 order (147 units) is lost. Current in-transit inventory is 381 units, which includes orders from Period 9 (35), Period 10 (142), Period 11 (57), and the lost Period 2 order (147) which the OR backend still counts in its pipeline. Because the backend doesn't know the Period 2 order is lost, it will under-order. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and the volatile lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure we cover the maximum likely delay. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand average (~103) recently observed compared to the long-term history. I am setting sigma_hat to explicit (50) to account for recent high volatility (ranging from 89 to 141) and to ensure a higher service level given the $19 profit margin vs $1 holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received 177 units (from Period 9 and 10 orders), confirming that the Period 9 order took 3 periods and the Period 10 order took 2 periods. The Period 2 order (147 units) is definitely lost. Lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2 (average ~2), but with a high variance, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for the OR engine while using a higher sigma to buffer against the volatility. Observed demand in Period 12 was 153, the highest yet, following a high of 141 in Period 9. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 114.6, compared to the overall mean of 100.25. I am shifting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this upward trend in demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to account for the increased volatility (141, 100, 89, 153) ensuring a sufficient safety stock (z-score (~2.9) multiplied by the higher sigma).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shift confirmed: Last 5 periods (P8-P12) average 114.6 (+14% vs long-term mean). Volatility has increased significantly with peaks over 140 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory and 406 units in-transit. Historic demand has shifted upwards; the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaged 122.6 units, compared to the initial average of ~91. Specifically, P12 saw demand reach 153. Lead time (L) is erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. I will use L=3 (explicit) as a conservative estimate to ensure coverage given recent stockouts and delivery variability. I set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher mean (122.6), resulting in a base stock targeted at (1+3)*122.6. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the significantly increased volatility (standard deviation ~26). This setup aims to rebuild safety stock and mitigate the high stockout risk observed in Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Last 5 periods (P9-P13) average 122.6 (+35% vs long-term mean); Individual peak demand reached 153 units in P12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1083.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime. The last 5 periods (P10-P14) have an average demand of 113.8 units, which is significantly higher than the training data average. Furthermore, the maximum demand reached 153 in Period 12, suggesting high volatility. The on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently experiencing stockouts. The lead time continues to be erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P11 arrived in 3 periods, P10 in 2 periods). Given this instability, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of observed delays and to cover the pipeline risk. For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the last 5 periods (which captures the shift better than the long-term average) multiplied by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I am using the recent 5 periods to capture the increased volatility evidenced by the P12 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Last 6 periods (P9-P14) average 118.3 units vs historical ~91; Stockout risk is high due to lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1553.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face significant demand volatility and lead-time instability. Demand has recently shifted upwards, with the last 7 periods (P9-P15) averaging 113.4 units, compared to the early average of ~90. Recent demand specifically has shown spikes up to 153. Lead times are highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P11 took 3, P12 took 3, while P10 took 2). Given this variance, planning for a 3-period lead time (L=3) is safer to prevent stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is low (43) and demand is unpredictable. I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~113.4). For sigma_hat, I'm using the last 7 periods to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~25), providing a buffer against stockouts which have occurred recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~113 units since Period 9 (7 observations); Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods, requiring a higher safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $742.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 9, with an average of approximately 113.6 units over the last 8 periods (average of P9-P16 is ~112). The lead time remains highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods instead of the promised 2. Currently, there are 426 units in-transit (Orders from P14, P15, P16), with the P14 order (168 units) expected to arrive in Period 17 (3-period lead time). On-hand inventory is 75 units, but there were significant stockouts in P13 and P14. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3) and the risk of lost orders (as seen in P2), I am setting L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime (+24% vs. long-term mean), and sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 8 periods to reflect the heightened volatility (demand peak of 153 vs low of 43).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 9 at ~113.6 units (8 periods of data); lead time of 3 periods is the more reliable planning horizon despite the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $453.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has significantly cooled down in the last two periods (43 in P16, 39 in P17), compared to the higher regime (~114) observed between P9 and P15. However, this may be a temporary fluctuation rather than a permanent regime shift. On-hand inventory is healthy at 288 units, and we have 209 units in-transit (orders from P15 and P17). Lead times have consistently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of this volatility and ensure adequate safety stock. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the recent average of the last 9 periods (P9-P17) is approximately 96.6 units, reflecting both the high-demand period and the recent drop. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while balancing the recent lower demand observations.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand softening: Period 16-17 demand averaged 41 units, a 64% decrease from the P9-P15 average of ~114 units; monitoring for a sustained regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1272.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong downward shift over the last three periods (Periods 16-18), with samples of 43, 39, and 78. This contrast with the previous regime (average ~114) suggests either a seasonal drop or a new low-demand phase. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to quickly adjust the base stock downward and avoid excessive holding costs on the 210 units currently on-hand. Lead time remains erratic, having fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods in recent history (P14-P17). I will continue to use an explicit lead time of 3 for parameter calculation to maintain a safety buffer against stockouts during this volatile delivery environment. The pipeline inventory (233 units) plus current on-hand (210 units) is quite high relative to the recent demand dip, so the OR backend will likely minimize new ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg decreased from ~114 to 53.3 over last 3 periods (-53%).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 19 is 50.75 units, a 55% reduction from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~114). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to adapt to this lower demand level and prevent excessive inventory accumulation, given the current high on-hand stock of 167 units. Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen in Periods 4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17), so I will maintain L at an explicit value of 3 to ensure the safety stock calculation covers the likely worst-case arrival time. With 167 units on-hand and 233 in-transit, we are currently overextended relative to the new demand level, so the backend OR logic (base-stock minus pipeline) should naturally suppress new orders until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg decreased from ~114 to 50.75 over last 4 periods (-55%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $853.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has significantly shifted downward since Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 50.8 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51), a sharp decrease from the previous average of ~114 units. We have on-hand inventory of 116 units and 233 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, and P18). The lead time remains erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safest estimate for planning. Given the high stock levels relative to the new, lower demand, I am using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this low-demand regime and prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer for lead time volatility. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 5 periods to reflect recent variance. L is set to explicit 3 to account for the frequent maximum lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg decreased from ~114 to 50.8 over last 5 periods (-55%). Lead time volatility remains confirmed in the 1-3 period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1024.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the average demand is 51.83 units, a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (~114 units). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this new lower-demand state accurately. Lead time remains volatile (range 1-3 periods), making 3 periods the appropriate conservative planning horizon (L=3) to prevent stockouts despite the current high pipeline inventory (233 units) and existing on-hand stock (59 units). The high pipeline inventory relative to the new lower demand mean suggests the OR backend will naturally reduce ordering to allow inventory to bleed down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg decreased from ~114 to 51.8 over last 6 periods (-55%). Lead time volatility persists in the 1-3 period range.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is 50.4 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~114 units. Choosing N=7 for mu_hat captures this current lower-demand state accurately. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1). Using 'calculate' for L will allow the backend to average these historical observations (averaging approximately 2.3). The pipeline inventory is currently high (233 units) relative to recent demand, and with 17 units on-hand, the total cover is well above the projected needs for the lead time plus review period (approx 3.3 * 50 = 165). The OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a zero or small order, which is appropriate given the current excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: average decreased from ~114 to 50.4 over last 7 periods (-56%). Lead time remains volatile in the 1-3 period range.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, decreasing from a mean of ~114 units to a mean of 53.3 units over the last 8 periods (P16-P23). The most recent demand (P23) was 80, which is slightly higher than the local average but still well below the previous regime's peaks. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline contains 233 units (ordered between P17-P23, though several orders haven't arrived). Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods, frequently 3), I am maintaining L=3 for planning to ensure the backend computes a sufficient base stock for the lead time plus the review period. I will use the last 8 samples (N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while accounting for the recent uptick in P23 volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: average decreased from ~114 to 53.3 over last 8 periods (P16-P23, -53%).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16 and has remained consistently low compared to earlier periods. From Period 16 to 24 (9 samples), the average demand is 51.1 units. The most recent demand (P24) was 34 units. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have 271 units in transit, including orders from P15 (27), P17 (35), P18 (24), and P24 (38). However, the orders from P15, P17, and P18 are significantly overdue (7, 5, and 4 periods since ordering respectively), suggesting they may be lost or delayed. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3), I will set L to 3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=9 to capture the low-demand regime since P16, which helps prevent over-ordering while accounting for the recent average of ~51 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. The average demand for the last 10 periods (Period 16\u201325) is 53.5 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~114 units. Period 25 concludes with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout, as recent orders (Period 24, 38 units) have not yet arrived. The in-transit pipeline (271 units) is inflated because it includes orders from Period 15, 17, and 18 (27, 35, and 24 units respectively) which are now 8-10 periods old and almost certainly lost, similar to the lost shipment from Period 2. The true in-transit inventory is likely just the Period 24 order (38 units). Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient coverage given the supply instability. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (53.5 avg) and for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (total 86 units) as they are 7+ periods past promised lead time. Current demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at ~53.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context starting from Period 16 shows a significantly lower mean compared to the high-demand regime observed between Periods 9 and 15. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 58 units (sum of demands P16-P26: 43+39+78+43+51+57+42+80+34+68+106 = 641; 641/11 = 58.3). However, there is a distinct uptick in the last two periods (68, 106), which may indicate a return to a higher demand level or increased volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 271 units in transit, but many of these are likely lost (as noted in Carry-over insights, P15, P17, P18 orders totaling 86 units are considered lost). Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will continue using an 'explicit' value of 3 for planning to ensure safety stock covers the late arrivals. For demand (mu_hat), a recent window of N=11 (Periods 16-26) captures the current regime shift, resulting in a more accurate forecast than the long-term mean. Sigma_hat is also set using this recent window to capture the increased volatility seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing at Period 25: Recent demands (68, 106) suggest a potential upward shift from the ~53 unit mean observed since Period 16.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Recent demand data shows a significant upward shift: the last three periods (P25-P27) saw demands of 68, 106, and 125, averaging ~100 units/period, compared to the ~53 unit average observed from P16-P24. This suggests a new regime or seasonal spike. In-transit inventory is high (307 units), but given that orders from P15, P17, and P18 are confirmed lost and lead times have historically reached up to 3 periods, we must set parameters robustly. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the upward trend and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods explicitly to provide a safer buffer against the observed 1-3 period range, especially since the product is currently out of stock.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 25: average demand increased from ~53 to ~100 over the last 3 periods (+88%). Stockout currently active.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a sustained stockout while transitioning to a new demand regime. A significant shift occurred at Period 25: the demand mean jumped from ~53 units (P16-P24) to approximately 101.5 units (P25-P28) \u2013 an increase of nearly 90%. Period 28 demand was 107. Lead time remains highly volatile, historically ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with several orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 24, and 25 currently unaccounted for (totaling 154 units in older 'In-transit' that are likely lost). Total visible In-transit is 455 units, but given the high probability of lost shipments, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow for the maximum observed delay and high safety stock. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime of ~100 units/period. sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the increased variance during this shift, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level given the $19 vs $1 profit/cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 25: mean increased from ~53 to ~101.5 (+91%) based on last 4 periods (68, 106, 125, 107). Significant probability of lost orders remains high (orders from P24 and P25 are now overdue).

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 has shifted upward significantly. The demands for Periods 25-29 are 68, 106, 125, 107, and 116, averaging approximately 104.4 units. This is a clear departure from the previous ~53 unit mean. Consequently, I am using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period. Lead time remains volatile; while Period 27 arrived in 2 periods, many previous orders (P24, P25) are currently overdue, and historical data suggests 3 periods is a safer planning horizon. I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for sufficient pipeline inventory during this high-demand phase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing consecutive stockouts, necessitating aggressive ordering via the OR backend's base stock logic.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 25: mean increased from ~53 to ~104.4 (+97%) based on last 5 periods (68, 106, 125, 107, 116). Orders from P24 and P25 are now highly likely lost (5-6 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2192.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 25, moving from an average of ~53 units to ~101.4 units. The last five periods (P26-P30) show demand of 106, 125, 107, 116, 117, confirming a sustained high-demand regime with an average of 114.2. Recent lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P27 and P28 orders arrived in P29 and P30 respectively), but historical volatility suggests a buffer for 3 periods is safer. Pipeline inventory is currently high (342 units), however, a significant portion of this (from P24, P25, P29) is at risk of being lost or significantly delayed, as seen in the game history where several orders simply never arrived (e.g., P15, P17, P18). To ensure service levels during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture the upward shift, while maintaining a lead time estimate that balances the promised 2 and observed 3.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime starting P25 is sustained: last 5 periods average 114.2 (+115% vs previous regime). Recent lead times have hit the promised 2 periods, but history shows frequent drift to 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume regime starting at Period 25. The last 7 periods (P25-P31) show a mean demand of approximately 112.4 units (68, 106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148), with the most recent sample hitting a new high of 148. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 31. Inventory in-transit is high (346 units), but orders from Periods 24 and 25 (38 units total) are now 6-7 periods old and highly likely lost based on previous game history. Although recent arrivals (P29, P30) adhered to the promised 2-period lead time, history repeatedly shows drift to 3 periods. To minimize stockout risk while maintaining service levels in this high-demand phase, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for volatility, and mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current regime mean of ~112 units. This translates to mu_hat \u2248 448 (4 * 112).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P25-P31): average demand increased to ~112.4 units (+110% vs previous regime). Orders from P24 and P25 are confirmed lost (7+ periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting at Period 25 is firmly sustained, with the last 8 periods (P25-P32) averaging 110.6 units per period. Period 32 demand was 98 units. Inventory on-hand is currently 0, with a stockout occurring in the last period. Despite a promised lead time of 2, actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (Period 31 order arrived in 1 period, but many previous orders were delayed or lost). I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~110.6) and sigma_hat with N=8 to account for recent volatility. For lead time, I'm using the 'explicit' method with a value of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed history of 3-period arrivals and potential losses, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for a 4-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P32) average confirmed at 110.6 units/period (+107% vs P16-P24). Lead time remains erratic (observed 1-3 periods).

Current demand is significantly higher than previous periods, requiring a robust inventory position. On-hand inventory is 39 units, with 365 units in transit. However, history reveals significant procurement risks: orders from P24 and P25 are confirmed lost, and orders from P29 and P30 (30 and 41 units respectively) are now at Period 34 and haven't concluded (L=4 and L=5 respectively), suggesting they might also be lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently but show signs of significant delay or loss for specific batches. I will set L to 3 to ensure the safety buffer accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time observed in history. mu_hat will use the last 9 periods (P25-P33) to capture the current high-demand regime, as the previous 53-unit regime is no longer relevant. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 9 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 29 (30 units) and Period 30 (41 units) are likely lost or severely delayed (L=5 and L=4 currently with no arrival). This continues the pattern of intermittent lost shipments.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is sustained at an average of approximately 111.7 units (P25-P34). The current period begins with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent evidence of lost or significantly delayed shipments (P24, P25, P29, and P30 are all currently overdue). Total in-transit inventory is 476 units, which nominally covers about 4.3 periods of demand (476 / 111.7). However, history shows a high probability of these in-transit units being lost. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to maintain service level. I set L=2 (promised) but use the most recent 10 samples (P25-P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime and its associated volatility accurately. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally moderate ordering if the pipeline is perceived as full, but setting parameters based on the current regime ensures the base stock level remains high enough to buffer against lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P34) average is 111.7 units/period; lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods) with persistent shipment losses (P24, P25, P29, P30 overdue).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 25. For the last 11 periods (P25-P35), demand has averaged 109.0 units, significantly higher than the previous period's low. However, we are currently facing a severe stockout because multiple orders appear lost or delayed. Orders from P24 (38 units), P25 (0 units), P29 (30 units), and P30 (41 units) have not arrived. Specifically, the P29 order is now at L=6 (compared to a promised L=2). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the OR backend uses pipeline inventory (476 units) to calculate orders, the actual usable pipeline is much lower due to these likely lost shipments. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'In-transit' figure, I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for historical volatility and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the current high-demand regime. This keeps the base stock calculation aligned with the current ~109 units/period mean.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from Periods 29 and 30 (total 71 units) as they are 5+ periods past promised lead time; Current high-demand regime (P25-P35) average is 109.0 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is currently averaging 105.7 units (P25-P36), with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging 97.8 units. Although there's a slight recent dip, the volatility remains high. Lead time is highly erratic (1-3 periods) with persistent lost orders (P24, P25, P29, P30 are now confirmed lost or so delayed they should be excluded from pipeline inventory for planning). Currently, 'In-transit' is 398, but the OR backend doesn't know some of those are likely lost; however, since I cannot manually adjust the pipeline inventory, I will set a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to ensure the base stock calculation triggers sufficient orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figures. I'll use N=12 for mu_hat to cover the entire high-demand regime (P25-P36) and N=12 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of actual observed lead times (1-3 range).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P36) average is 105.7 units; extreme lead time volatility continues with significant shipment loss risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 25 has stabilized into a high-demand regime, with an average of approximately 105.7 units per period. The most recent demand (P37) was 95 units. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a recurring pattern of lost shipments (P24, P25, P29, P30 are now long overdue and confirmed lost in previous insights). Period 34 arrived in 2 periods, while P36 arrived in 1 period, suggesting a recent stabilization in delivery speed, but the history of losses mandates a cautious buffer. I will use the last 13 periods (P25-P37) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Given the consistent evidence of lead time variability, I will explicitly set L to 1.5 to provide a slight buffer over the promised lead time of 2 (accounting for the 'current period plus lead time' logic in the OR backend) without over-indexing on the losses which are effectively removed from pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P37) remains active with mean ~105 units; Lead time remains volatile but recent orders (P34, P36) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting Period 25 continues, with an average demand of approximately 105.7 units (P25-P38). The most recent demand was 108. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a persistent risk of lost shipments (P24, P25, P29, P30 appear lost). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a stockout in Period 38. The in-transit inventory of 385 units includes orders from Period 35 (0 units), P37 (20 units), and likely older overdue units. To ensure availability given the 107% demand increase since the previous regime and the risk of lost orders, I am setting mu_hat using the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the full breadth of this high-demand phase. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed upper bound of delivery times, which is critical for maintaining service levels with a $19 profit compared to $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P38) average is 105.7 units; lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods) with persistent shipment losses (P24, P25, P29, P30 confirmed lost).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 25 is well-established with a mean of approximately 105.7 units. Recent demand in Period 39 (126) and Period 38 (108) confirms this high-demand state persists. Lead time remains the primary source of uncertainty; while the promised lead time is 2, historical observations range from 1 to 3 periods, and multiple orders (P24, P25, P29, P30) have been lost entirely. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit balance (495 units), many of these units are likely from lost or significantly delayed shipments. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (P25-P39) which has 15 samples. I set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent drift to 3 periods, ensuring the base stock level (target for L+1 periods) provides a sufficient buffer against stockouts during this high-demand, high-risk period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 is currently averaging 106.8 units per period, with high volatility. Recent demand (P38-P40) is consistent with this high level (108, 126, 124). Lead time remains erratic, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, although P39 arrived in 1 period. Total in-transit is 390, but a significant portion of this represents older, likely lost orders (P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P35, P37 - total 222 units). After netting out these likely lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is approximately 168 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and current demand sustained at ~110, I am using recent_N (N=16, covering the P25-P40 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility environment. Setting L to 'calculate' to account for the observed distribution of arrivals (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P40) confirmed: average demand is 106.8 units/period. Orders from P33 (23 units), P35 (0 units), P37 (20 units), and P38 (0 units) are being monitored for delay vs loss given the history of lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 25 is staying consistent, with the last 17 periods (P25-P41) averaging approximately 105.1 units. The most recent demand in Period 41 (78) is slightly lower but within expected variance. Inventory management remains the primary challenge due to extreme lead time volatility and frequent shipment losses. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 453 units; however, significant portions of this are likely lost: orders from P33 (23 units), P35 (0 units), P37 (20 units), P38 (0 units), and P40 (5 units) are all past or at their promised lead time without arriving. Given that P33 and P37 are 8 and 4 periods old respectively, and knowing the history of losses, these units cannot be relied upon. To maintain service levels against a mean demand of ~105 and a volatile lead time (often reaching 3 periods), L is set to 'explicit' at 3. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the full current regime since Period 25. sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=17 to account for the high volatility observed in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P25-P41) remains stable with a mean of 105.1 units/period. Persistent shipment losses (P24, P25, P29, P30 confirmed; P33, P37 likely) require conservative pipeline accounting.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting from Period 25 continues, with the last 18 periods (P25-P42) averaging 104.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P42: 95) aligns with this. Lead time remains highly volatile and prone to shipment loss. Orders from P33, P37, P38, and P41 (total 111 units) are currently 'in-transit' but represent significant risks of being lost based on historical patterns (P24, P25, P29, P30 confirmed lost). The In-transit figure of 498 likely overstates actual viable pipeline inventory. I will maintain L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer against the frequent 3-period lead times and losses. mu_hat will use the recent 18-period average (L+1=4 periods of coverage) to stabilize against the high demand. sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the increased volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from P33, P37, and P38 (total 43 units) as they are 5+ periods past promised lead time; Current high-demand regime (P25-P42) average is 104.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 25, with a mean of 104.5 units per period. Recently, demand has shown some softening (Period 41-43 average ~78.7 units), but given the significant history of lost shipments and the high cost of stockouts (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will continue to forecast based on the sustained P25-P42 regime mean (~105 units). Inventory management is currently critical as on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (493 units) appears large, but a significant portion is represented by orders from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37, and P38 which are now confirmed or highly likely lost based on period-over-period tracking. Actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. I am setting L to 3 to ensure the safety buffer covers the maximum observed lead time. mu_hat is set to 420 (105 units/period * (3+1) periods) using the recent high-demand regime mean. sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the high-demand regime since Period 25 to account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from P39 (110 units) is NOT yet confirmed, but the order from P41 (63 units) and P42 (45 units) are currently within the normal 1-3 period delivery window. High-demand regime (P25-P43) mean adjusted to 102.3 units/period following three lower demand periods (78, 95, 63).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1137.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime desde Period 25 has been high, but recent data from Period 41-44 shows a slight softening (avg 74 units) compared to the long-term regime average (~105 units). However, given the significant stockout history and lead time volatility (1-3 periods), a conservative estimate is needed. On-hand inventory is 3, with 430 in-transit. A review of 'in-transit' reveals significant 'ghost' inventory. Orders from P24, 25, 29, 30, 33, 37, 38, and 39 (totaling 290 units) are virtually certain to be lost as they are all 5+ periods past the promised lead time. Discarding these, the real pipeline is ~140 units (P42=45, P43=0, P44=0, etc.). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the broad high-demand regime while allowing for the recent softening, and 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of order from P39 (110 units) as it is 5 periods past order date without arrival. Real pipeline inventory significantly lower than 'In-transit' figure due to cumulative losses.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (starting Period 25) remains active, though it shows significant volatility, with demand oscillating between extreme lows (~60) and highs (130). Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is approximately 94.6 units. Lead time remains erratic but suggests a planning horizon of 3 periods is safer given recent arrivals (P40, P41, P42 all took 1-3 periods). A major concern is the 'In-transit' figure of 438 units; history shows a high frequency of lost shipments. Subtracting confirmed/likely losses (P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37, P38, P39 totaling 282 units), the effective pipeline is closer to 156 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and widespread stockouts, I will use a 6-period window to capture the current high-demand volatility while setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend builds sufficient safety stock to buffer against the frequent 3-period lead times and shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P45) remains active but with high volatility (mean ~102); Effective pipeline is significantly lower than 'In-transit' due to cumulative lost orders (est. 282 units lost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 remains the dominant factor, with a mean of approximately 104.5 units per period. Although the last six periods (Periods 41-46) have shown high volatility (60-130 units), the overall average remains near the 'high-demand' level. Lead time continues to be highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods, and history shows a pattern of lost shipments (cumulative loss estimate remains ~282 units). Currently, the 'In-transit' figure is 438, but accounting for the 282 units likely lost (including verified losses from earlier periods and the confirmed loss of the 110-unit order from P39), the 'Effective Pipeline' is only 156 units. With 0 on-hand inventory, and the next possible arrivals coming from Period 45 (53 units), we are in a stockout. I will set mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at the high-demand mean (~105), which equals 420. Given the high volatility and lost order risk, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current noise levels. Setting L to 3 is necessary to reflect the actual planning horizon observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the high-demand regime established in Period 25, with a mean of approximately 104.7 units since that shift (P25-P47). Recent demand (last 3 periods: 130, 97, 122) remains high but follows the volatile pattern observed throughout this regime. The primary challenge is extreme lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and frequent shipment loss. Based on the carry-over insights and audit of 'In-transit' vs 'Concluded' history: orders from P1-P42 have either arrived or been confirmed lost (282 units total lost). The current 'In-transit' of 493 includes P43 (0), P44 (0), P45 (53), P46 (0), P47 (55). However, there is a discrepancy in the provided 'In-transit' figure compared to orders placed, likely due to backend accounting of previous lost shipments including P39 (which was 110 units). Given we are at P48 of 50, safety stock is prioritized to avoid stockouts in the final periods. I will use the recent_N method (N=23 for the regime length since P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand state effectively. I will set L to 3 (explicit) because, while the promised lead time is 2, arrivals frequently take 3 periods, and planning for the maximum reliable lead time is necessary to ensure availability.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime since P25 with mean ~105 and high volatility. Total confirmed lost units estimated at ~282; effective pipeline is significantly lower than systemic 'In-transit'.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 25 continues to hover at a mean of approximately 105 units/period. Period 48 conclude shows another stockout across Periods 46-48 due to zero arrivals. We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The 'In-transit' figure of 493 is misleading due to systemic loss of orders throughout the game. Confirmed lost units from P15, P17, P18, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37, P38, and P39 total 392 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is actually around 101 units (mostly from P45 and P47 orders). With lead time L averaging 2-3 periods (planning for 3), we need to cover demand for the final steps of the game. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime since P25 for both mu and sigma, and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical instability while the backend uses the result for base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The high-demand regime that began in Period 25 persists, with the most recent demand sample (Period 49) at 119 units. The mean since Period 25 is approximately 105 units. Significant issues with lost shipments continue to plague the pipeline; orders from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P35, P37, P38, P39, P40, P43, P45, P46, P47, P48 and P49 contribute to an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 493, while historical patterns suggest a high percentage of these will never arrive. On-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR engine's 'cap' and 'final order' logic depends on pipeline inventory (In-transit), the inflated systemic figure will likely prevent the engine from placing necessary orders if we use 'default' methods. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime (~105/period) and a volatile lead time (L=3). base_stock = (L+1) * mean + z * sigma. With L=3, mean=105, and high volatility, a target base stock around 550-600 units is appropriate to ensure availability despite shipment losses. I will set mu_hat to 420 (which is (1+3)*105) and sigma_hat explicitly to 100 to increase the safety buffer.
