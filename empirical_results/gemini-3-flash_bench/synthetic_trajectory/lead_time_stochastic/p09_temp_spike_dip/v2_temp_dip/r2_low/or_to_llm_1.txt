In-transit is 151 (the Period 2 order). If that 151 arrives this period (P5), ending inventory would be approximately 56 + 151 - ~100 (demand) = 107. If it does not arrive, we stock out.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is relatively stable: 114, 117, 103, 106. Average is 110. \n4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 106 units. OR uses mean demand and promised LT (2). \n5. Strategy: I need to ensure coverage for (L+1) periods. With L=2 or 3, I need enough to cover 3-4 periods of demand (~330-440 units). Total current assets (On-hand + Pipeline) = 56 + 151 = 207. This is insufficient for a 3-period horizon. Ordering 106 (OR rec) brings total assets to 313. Given the risk of P2 being 'lost' or further delayed, and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I must balance stockout risk with holding costs. Since the profit/holding cost ratio (critical fractile) is 0.5, the targeted service level is lower, suggesting we should not overstock. However, the current pipeline is thin.

Inventory Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is reported as 651 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, the orders from P2 (151 units) and P6 (150 units) are confirmed lost. Thus, effective in-transit = 651 - 301 = 350 units. These consist of orders from P11 (150), P12 (150), and P13 (50). Since P11 was ordered 3 periods ago, it is expected to arrive during Period 14 (assuming L=3 max).\n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P9-P13) has averaged approximately 90 units (77, 89, 96, 99, 85). \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it views the raw 651 units in-transit as sufficient to cover base stock. After correcting for the 301 lost units, our effective pipeline is 350. With 0 on-hand and an average demand of ~90, 350 units covers ~3.8 periods. Given the lead time variability (up to 3 periods), we need to ensure we don't stock out while waiting for P11-P13.

Pipeline Inventory Reconciliation: The reported In-transit is 601 units. However, previous Carry-Over insights and history confirm that the order from Period 2 (151 units) and Period 6 (150 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective In-transit is 601 - 301 = 300 units.

Historical average is ~99. 4. Strategic adjustment: On-hand is 64. The OR recommendation is 0 because it believes the pipeline is full (601 units).

Therefore, the effective Pipeline is 442 - 301 = 141 units (consisting of orders from P15 (50), P16 (50 - arrived, oh wait, P16 arrived in P17, so the 442 reflects remaining in transit), P17 (91) - let's re-verify). P15 (50) and P17 (91) are the active in-transit units (50+91=141). 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has dropped significantly (P16: 40, P17: 33) compared to the historical average near 100. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the current on-hand (207) plus pipeline (141) = 348 units, which covers nearly 10 periods of current low demand. 4.

This leaves a 'real' pipeline of only 170 units (Period 25: 100, Period 27: 70). The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely influenced by this inflated pipeline and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0). However, the demand regime has recently shifted again: after a low period (P16-P22 avg ~53), recent demand (P24-P27) has surged to an average of 73 units, with the most recent two periods being 114 and 100. At 0 on-hand, we are currently stocking out. With an expected lead time of 1-3 periods, the units ordered in P25 might arrive this period, but to prevent a prolonged stockout and account for the recent demand increase, I will place a conservative order of 60 units.

The current effective (live) pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (100 units), Period 41 (150 units), and Period 42 (150 units), totaling 400 units. Since P40 has not arrived by the start of P43 (order date P40, current start P43), it is now 3 periods old and potentially delayed or lost, though I will still count it as the most likely next arrival. Demand has stabilized in a high regime averaging ~105-115 units per period over the last 5-7 periods.

Current on-hand (18) + effective pipeline (P44: 150, P45: 150, P47: 50 = 350) totals 368 units. This is sufficient to cover the remaining demand through Period 50. Since the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), overreacting and building excess inventory at the very end of the simulation is risky and costly.
