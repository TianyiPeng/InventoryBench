Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, an order is necessary to meet future demand. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) shows a mean of 99.8 (118, 130, 72, 58, 121). To set the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (2 periods). 2) mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of samples = 3 * 99.8 = 299.4. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the initial order covers the expected demand during the lead time plus the review period. 3) sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of the 5 samples (approx 31.9) multiplied by sqrt(1+L) = 31.9 * 1.732 \u2248 55.2. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I'll use explicit values to anchor the first decision firmly on the provided sample data.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 153 units was placed (based on initial demand estimates). Demand in Period 1 was 114 units, but because the promised lead time is 2 periods, nothing arrived in Period 1 (ending on-hand is 0, sales are 0). The 153 units are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current demand data (P1: 114/118, P2: 130, P3: 72, P4: 58, P5: 121) shows an average of ~99.6 units per period. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the first order won't arrive until Period 3, we need to maintain the replenishment cycle. The OR backend will use the base stock policy cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the engine will aim for the median demand to minimize total costs (holding cost is significant).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (153 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 297 units in transit (153 from P1 + 144 from P2). Demand for the first two periods was 114 and 117, which is very close to the provided historical samples (118, 130). There is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise, nor that the demand regime has shifted from the historical average (~100 units/period). I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat, and use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (incorporating the most recent historical data and the first two game periods) to capture the slightly higher initial game demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Historical demand (Periods 1-3) has been 114, 117, and 103, with additional historical samples provided in the prompt (118, 130, 72, 58, 121). The average demand across these 8 data points is approximately 101.6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (153 units) and Period 2 (144 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 297 units. Based on the 2-period lead time, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution (visible in Period 4 start) and the Period 2 order during Period 4's resolution. However, \u2018Period 3 conclude\u2019 shows arrived=0 for the Period 1 order. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (W = 4 - 1 = 3) or there is a delay. I will adjust the lead time parameter L to 3 to account for this observed delay and use recent_N for demand to capture the most relevant average (N=5 for the samples provided).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was 114, 117, 103, and 106 (mean ~110). In Period 4, the order from Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, suggesting the actual lead time (L=3) is longer than the promised lead time (L=2). Currently, we have 47 units on hand and 258 units in transit (orders from P2 and P4). Given the observed lead time of 3 periods, we set L to 3. For demand (mu_hat), we use the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to project across (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is set to the default to account for the standard deviation of all samples across the (1+L) window.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 393 units in-transit. History shows a stockout in Period 5 due to lead time variability. Specifically, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods instead of the promised 2. The order from Period 2 (144 units) is now at L=4 and has not arrived yet, suggesting either further delays or a lost shipment. However, following the sequence, it should have arrived in Period 5 if L=3. Since it didn't, I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed reality and encourage the OR engine to maintain a larger pipeline. Demand has been relatively stable (Mean ~112). I will use N=5 for demand to capture recent levels while ignoring the noise of the stockout period's sales (which were capped by inventory).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: P2 order delayed beyond L=3 (expected P5, not arrived); P1 confirmed L=3.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a longer and potentially volatile lead time. Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3). Period 2's order, placed with an expected arrival in Period 5 (L=3), has not yet arrived by the end of Period 6 (now at L=4+). This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3, and currently potentially 4 or more. I will set L to 4 explicitly to account for this delay and protect against stockouts. Historical demand mean is approximately 108 units ((114+117+103+106+132+80)/6). With L=4, mu_hat (covering L+1 periods) is estimated at 5 \xd7 108 = 540. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the standard deviation across all available demand samples while accounting for the extended lead time multiplier in the backend.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >= 4 periods: Period 2 order (placed P2) not arrived as of P6 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are consistently 3 periods (Period 1 arrived at P4; Period 4 arrived at P7). Curiously, orders from Period 2 and 3 are missing/lost, as they should have arrived by P5/P6. This suggests high lead-time volatility or carrier loss. Current on-hand is 42, with a massive pipeline of 430 units (mostly from the overdue/lost Period 2-3 orders and recent orders P5-P7). Demand is currently in a lower regime; the last 3 periods (P5-P7) averaged 94.6, compared to the initial 110+. I am setting L=3 based on consistent observed arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the recent downward trend in demand while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the unreliable arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (P1 and P4 both took 3 periods). Orders from P2 and P3 are currently 5 and 4 periods old respectively, and likely lost.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following Period 8 conclude, we observed two arrivals: 135 units (ordered Period 5, lead_time=3) and 86 units (ordered Period 7, lead_time=1). The shipments from Period 2 and Period 3 are now 6 and 5 periods old respectively, and since the promised lead time is 2, these are effectively lost. The current on-hand inventory is 153. Pipeline inventory is 209 (65 units from Period 6, and any order placed in Period 8, though the history shows 0 ordered in P8). Demand mean remains stable around 100 units. Since observed lead times have varied (1, 3, 3, 3), I will set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough safety stock for the delivery delays. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand distribution (mean ~95, std ~25).

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 and Period 3 are confirmed lost (surpassing L=5). Lead time is volatile but most frequently 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with orders from Period 2 and 3 confirmed lost. Specifically, P4 arrived in 3 periods, P5 in 3 periods, and P7 in 1 period, while the P2 and P3 orders never arrived. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has averaged 94.2 units, a decrease from the initial mean of 111.3 (P1-P4). Given the loss of 288 units in the pipeline from P2/P3, the current in-transit (247) actually reflects the P6, P8, and P9 orders. Using L=3 as the explicit lead time is safer to protect against stockouts given the history of delays and losses. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the slightly downward trend in demand, and sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has shifted from ~111 to ~94 units starting Period 5 (-15%). Lead time is confirmed volatile (1-3 periods) with a moderate risk of complete order loss (P2, P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 (demand 89 vs 76 on-hand). The game history shows that orders from Period 2 and 3 are officially lost (exceeding 7 periods since order date). Observed lead times for successful deliveries are: P1 (3), P4 (3), P5 (3), and P7 (1), giving an average actual lead time of 2.5 periods. I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the stockout and the frequency of 3-period arrivals. Demand shows a regime shift: Periods 1-4 averaged 110, while Periods 5-10 averaged 93 units. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures this lower demand regime (avg ~93.3). With L=3, mu_hat will be calculated as (1+3)*93.3 \u2248 373. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide an appropriate safety buffer for the high holding cost environment (profit=holding=1.0, leading to a 50% target service level).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a regime shift from Period 5 onwards. The average demand since Period 5 is approximately 94 units per period (samples: 132, 80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96). Comparing the last 7 periods (since P5) vs the whole history, the mean is significantly lower than the initial P1-P4 range (~110 units). Lead time remains highly volatile, with observed arrivals occurring at L=1 and L=3. Most importantly, orders from Periods 2 and 3 (placed 9 and 10 periods ago) are definitely lost. Our current in-transit inventory (374) consists of orders from P6, P9, P10, and P11. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in P11. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (which include 3, 3, 3, 1), and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the lower demand regime (~94/period). This provides a base_stock target that accounts for the pipeline and recent demand while managing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from P9 and P10 (total 92 units), but demand was 99, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are stabilizing around an average of 2.5 periods (P9=3, P10=2, P7=1, P5=3, P4=3, P1=3). Orders from P2, P3, and P6 are still missing and confirmed lost as they are well beyond the 3-period window. Total in-transit is 283, which includes P11 (73) and P12 (1). Since on-hand is 0 and we are consistently hitting stockouts, I will set L to 3 to ensure the backend calculates a sufficient base stock for the 3-period lead window plus the decision period (L+1=4). Demand has shifted lower since P5; the mean of the last 8 periods (P5-P12) is 94.1. I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower but volatile demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Shipment from Period 6 confirmed lost (now 6 periods late). Lead time is averaging ~2.5 periods but remains volatile (1-3 range).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 5 onwards) shows a mean of approximately 92.5 units, down from the initial ~111 units. In Period 13, we had 0 units on-hand and 318 in-transit (orders from P6, P11, P12). The P6 order is 7 periods late and definitely lost. P11 (placed P11) is now in its 3rd period of transit, which is consistent with the mode lead time. P12 (placed P12) is in its 2nd period of transit. With 0 on-hand units and demand persisting, we need to ensure the pipeline covers future demand despite volatility. Lead times observed are 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2 periods (average ~2.5). I will set L to 3 to be safe against the frequent 3-period arrivals and use the last 9 samples for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime (~92.5/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 6 shipment (65 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Current demand regime (P5-P13) stable at ~92.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. The demand regime from Period 5 onwards remains stable at a mean of approximately 92 units. The lead time is volatile but averages around 2.5-3 periods (Recent arrivals: P9-L3, P10-L2, P11-L3). The shipment from Period 6 is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Current pipeline inventory consists of orders from P12 (1 unit), P13 (95 units), P14 (0 units), and the order placed this period (not yet reflected in game history but accounted for in backend calculation). Given the high loss risk (P2, P3, P6 lost) and stockouts, I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect the realistic arrival delay and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~92/period). Setting L=3 ensures the base stock covers (3+1)=4 periods of demand, helping mitigate both lead time volatility and the consequences of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Period 6 shipment (65 units) is now 8 periods late and confirmed lost. Demand regime continues to be stable at ~92 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 15 spiked to 134 units, significantly higher than the previous 10-period average of ~92 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced a stockout. The in-transit inventory is 370 units, primarily consisting of orders from P13 (95), P14 (0), P15 (66), and crucially, the lost shipment from P6 (65) and likely lost earlier shipments. Reconciling in-transit: Arrived in P15: P12 order (1). Pipeline includes P13 (95), P15 (66). P6 (65), P2 (144), and P3 (0) are considered lost. The lead time remains volatile, averaging ~3 periods for successful deliveries. Given the recent demand spike and the need to recover from stockouts while accounting for in-transit orders, I will use a recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the current regime including the recent spike (Avg ~96). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent actual lead time for non-lost orders, ensuring the base stock calculation covers enough periods to prevent further stockouts despite volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Demand spike observed in P15 (134 units) after 10 periods of stability at ~92. P6 shipment (65 units) is now 10 periods late and definitively lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows high volatility with a spike in P15 (134) followed by a sharp drop in P16 (40), but the long-term average since P5 remains stable around 92 units. The lead time is predominantly 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, and P13), making the effective lead time L=3. I am treating the order from P6 (65 units) as definitively lost after 10 periods. Currently, 291 units are in transit (Orders from P15: 66 and P16: 16, plus older pending stock). Given the parity between profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), a service level around 50% is theoretically optimal, though we bias slightly higher to avoid stockouts. I will use L=3 and a recent 5-period window for demand forecasting to capture the recent volatility while staying anchored to the sustained mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P15-P16 (134, 40) but the mean remains consistent with the P5-P14 regime (~92). Lead time is stabilized at 3 periods for current planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the Period 16 order (16 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, while the Period 13 order arrived in Period 16 (L=3), and the Period 12 order arrived in Period 15 (L=3). The Period 2, 3, and 6 orders remain lost. The lead time appears to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using an explicit lead time of 3 for planning to ensure sufficient pipeline coverage. Demand has been highly volatile in the last three periods (134, 40, 33), contrasting with the previous stable regime of ~92 units. This decline suggests a potential downward shift or high inventory variance. I will use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture the post-initial-drop average (P5-P17) while including the recent volatility, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in the last few periods. On-hand is 38, and in-transit is 285 (largely from orders in P15 and P17), which should buffer against current volatility if they arrive within L=3.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly from P15 onwards (range 33-134), though the long-term mean from P5-P17 remains near 90 units. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, ending on-hand inventory reached 0 after demand (67) exceeded starting inventory (38). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 311 units in-transit (P15: 66, P17: 10, P18: 26, plus likely older lost ones from P2, P3, P6). The lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods recently (P16 order arrived in P17 with L=1). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 'worst-case' reliable arrival window, protecting against stockouts. Demand volatility has increased since P15 (range 33-134), though the mean remains around 90. To capture this recent volatility while maintaining a stable forecast, I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime from P5 to now) and recent_N with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent spike in volatility starting at P15.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 15, with demand values spanning from 33 to 134. While the mean since Period 5 fluctuates around 90 units, the recent 5-period average (P15-P19) is lower at approximately 66 units. Given the high stockout frequency due to shipping delays, I will use a larger N for mu_hat to capture the broader volatility while dampening the impact of the extreme low in P17-P18. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 343 units in-transit. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure the pipeline covers the likely longest arrival window. Recent history shows orders from P18 and P19 are still in transit, so setting L=3 accounts for their expected arrival in P21/P22.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant backlog of orders in-transit (343 units). Recent lead times have shown high variability, with orders from P17 and P18 now late (3 and 2 periods old, respectively). Historical evidence shows most successful deliveries arrive within 3 periods, suggesting a likely arrival of at least one shipment in Period 21 or 22. Demand has significantly decreased and became more volatile starting around Period 15; the mean demand from P15-P20 is approximately 63 units, compared to the ~92 units seen in the previous regime. I am setting L=3 to account for the observed delivery pattern and using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower demand level and increased volatility. This should prevent over-ordering while account for the higher pipeline inventory already in place.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg decreased from ~92 to ~63 units (-31%) with significantly increased volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an on-hand inventory level of 0, despite a high in-transit pipeline of 343 units. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 15, moving from an average of ~92 units to ~63 units, though recent periods (P20, P21) show demand recovering towards 85 units. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with historical losses of orders from P2, P3, and P6. Currently, orders from P15 (unseen for 6 periods), P17 (4 periods), P18 (3 periods), and P19 (2 periods) are in transit. Specifically, the P15 order (66 units) is now 6 periods late and is highly likely lost, following the pattern of the lost P6 order. The P17, P18, and P19 orders are still within the 'at risk' to 'likely arriving' window. Given the current stockout and the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the priority is to avoid excessive over-ordering while accounting for likely losses. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while recognizing the slight upward trend in the last two periods. This helps the backend set a base stock that accounts for both the expected inventory in-transit and the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Period 15 shipment (66 units) is confirmed lost (now 6 periods late, exceeding the max observed lead time of 3). Demand remains in the P15-P21 regime (avg ~63), but has trended upward toward 85 in the last two periods.

Specifically, orders from P17 (10 units), P18 (26 units), P19 (32 units) are now 6, 5, and 4 periods old respectively. Given the history of lost shipments (P2, P3, P6, P15), there is a high probability these are lost or severely delayed. Demand shifted in P15 to a lower mean (~63) but has shown a slight recovery/volatility recently. I am setting L to 3 (most frequent actual lead time) to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the extended delivery window. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat (P15-P22) to capture the lower demand regime (~63 units/period) while accounting for recent variance. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the increased volatility observed since Period 15.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential shipment loss cluster identified for orders placed P17-P19 (all >3 periods old). Pipeline inventory of 343 units is likely inflated by these presumably lost units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are facing an inventory crisis. On-hand inventory is 0. While the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 343 units, historical evidence (Carry-over insights Period 23) confirms that orders from P17 (10 units), P18 (26 units), and P19 (32 units) are at least 4 periods old and likely lost, as the maximum observed lead time is 3. Furthermore, the order from P15 (66 units) and P6 (65 units) were previously confirmed lost. In total, approximately 199 units (65+66+10+26+32) are likely lost, leaving a functional pipeline of only 144 units. Demand has shifted: the regime from P15-P23 averages ~61.5 units, though recent volatility is high. To recover, I am setting lead time to 'explicit' at 3 periods (the most frequent maximum) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 9 periods (P15-P23 regime) to reflect the lower demand mean. By choosing a lower mu_hat, I allow the OR backend to order sufficiently, but effectively 'cap' the order to avoid over-ordering against the phantom pipeline. However, given 0 on-hand and a likely depleted real pipeline, an 'explicit' L=3 will force a higher base stock to cover the stockout gap.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination confirmed: Orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (combined 68 units) are now 4-6 periods late and considered lost. Functional pipeline is significantly lower than the reported 343 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 343. Analysis of the history and carry-over insights confirms that this pipeline is heavily contaminated by lost shipments from Periods 15 (66 units), 17 (10 units), 18 (26 units), and 19 (32 units), totaling 134 units currently stuck in transit far beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Additionally, older lost shipments (e.g., Period 6) still linger in the total. The last successful arrival was in Period 17 (ordered Period 16, L=1). Since no orders were placed in Periods 20-24, the actual 'active' pipeline is essentially zero. Demand has shifted to a lower-mean, high-volatility regime starting Period 15. Over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), demand averaged 63.2 units with significant dips and spikes. I will set L=3 based on historical stability before recent losses to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock for the delivery window. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and the increased variance, while choosing an explicit L to override the backend calculation which might be skewed by the unfulfilled (lost) orders.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory definitively contains ~214 units of lost stock (Orders from P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Active pipeline is 0 units as of Period 25.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical. We have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 343 units that is entirely composed of lost shipments. Orders from P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling roughly 214 units) are all significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods and should be considered lost. Recent 'In-transit' activity from P20-P25 shows no new orders placed. Our 'functional' pipeline is 0. Demand shifted around P15 to a lower, more volatile regime; excluding the anomalous '0' in P25, the mean since P15 (P15-P24) is approximately 63 units. Given the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' count (343) from the target base stock, it will likely place 0 orders unless we aggressively increase mu_hat or use an explicit value to force an order. Since the backend's logic is 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)', and pipeline (343) > estimated base stock for a lead time of 2-3, we must use a very high explicit mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline and restore inventory. I will set L to 3 (most frequent actual) and mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~63) plus the 343 phantom units to force an order that replenishes stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed that the entirety of the 343 units 'In-transit' are lost shipments (from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, etc.). Functional pipeline is 0. Demand regime since P15 averages ~63 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 534 units is highly contaminated by lost shipments (specifically from Periods 2, 3, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19). The ONLY active and viable shipment in the pipeline is the 191 units ordered in Period 26. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a Stockout, we must place an order that assumes the functional pipeline is 191 units. Following the P15 demand shift, the mean demand is ~63 units, but recent periods (P24, P26) show a recovery towards ~114 units. To avoid continued stockouts while accounting for lead time volatility, I will use a conservative demand estimate. I set L=explicit (3) to account for observed averages, and use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the contaminated history and the logic that would otherwise assume the 534 units are arriving. The target base stock covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Functional pipeline confirmed at 191 units (from P26). All other 343 units in the reported 534 'In-transit' are confirmed lost from historical periods (P2, P3, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, there is 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 534 is heavily contaminated by 343 units from lost orders (Periods 2, 3, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). The only functional order in the pipeline is 191 units placed in Period 26. Since the observed lead time is most frequently 3 periods, this order is expected to arrive in Period 29. Demand has shifted recently; while the P15-P21 regime averaged ~63, the last two concluded periods (P26-P27) saw a spike back to 114 and 100. I will use the last 13 samples (P15-P27) to capture this higher volatility and the recent upward trend. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time, which reduces the OR engine's tendency to over-order when L=2 is used against a 3-period arrival cycle. Sigma is set using the last 13 periods to account for the significantly increased demand variance since Period 15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 conclude, the shipment of 191 units from P26 arrived (L=2). This confirms that only the 191 units ordered in P26 were active, while the remaining 343 units in the 'In-transit' figure are long-lost shipments from P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19. Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is now 0. Demand has recently returned to a higher regime (~107 avg over the last 3 periods) compared to the mid-game slump. I am setting L=2 based on the most recent delivery. To restore inventory levels and account for the 0 active pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current demand spike (P26-P28), while the OR engine's budget logic will handle the order size after subtracting the effective pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods for the most recent order (P26). Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed at 0, as the 343 units 'In-transit' are verified as lost shipments from P19 and earlier.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' accounting. The OR engine considers the 343 units 'In-transit' as active pipeline inventory, but historical evidence (Carry-over insights Period 25-29) confirms these units (from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19) are lost. The active pipeline is currently 0. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock (Inventory Health = On-hand + In-transit), I must set mu_hat (the demand window) to a value high enough to offset the 343 phantom units while securing stock for the review+lead period (L+1 = 3 to 4 periods). The current demand regime (P15 onwards) averages ~63 units, but recent periods (P26-P28) show a resurgence toward ~110 units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to 343 (to cancel 'In-transit') + 330 (3 periods of ~110 demand) = 673. This forces an order despite the phantom pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' as the most recent arrival (P28) confirms a lead time of 2, within the volatile 1-3 range. sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for the high volatility observed in the P15-P29 data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, on-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting the stock in Period 30. The 'In-transit' count of 562 is significantly contaminated by lost shipments from previous regimes. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', 343 units from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 are definitively lost. Thus, the functional pipeline consists only of the 219 units ordered in Period 30. Recent lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods (P26 took 2 periods). Demand since Period 15 has been highly volatile but recently trending upward, with the last 5 periods (excluding P25 which had zero demand) averaging approximately 105 units. I am setting L to 2 (recent observation), and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-volatility demand regime and recent spike (P30 = 133). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the functional pipeline and the recent demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Functional pipeline confirmed at 219 units (from P30). The remaining 343 units in the 562 'In-transit' are confirmed lost from historical periods (P19 and earlier).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, on-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' of 562 units includes 343 units confirmed lost from historical periods (P2, P3, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only active pipeline shipment is the 219 units ordered in Period 30, which is expected to arrive in Period 32 (based on the recent L=2 observation from P26-P28). The demand regime has been highly volatile since Period 15, but has recently trended back toward a higher mean (P26: 114, P27: 100, P28: 117, P30: 133, P31: 84). Given L=2, mu_hat must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the mean of the most recent 6 periods (avg ~101.5) to set mu_hat, resulting in an explicit value of ~305. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 2 based on the most recent confirmed shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Functional pipeline consists only of the 219 units ordered at P30. All 343 units from orders prior to P20 are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P26-P31) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~101.5 compared to the previous ~63 regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observe that the 219 units ordered at Period 30 remain 'In-transit'. Given historical lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, this order is likely to arrive during Period 33 (lead time of 3). The reported 'In-transit' of 562 units is heavily skewed by 343 units of historical stock from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 that are confirmed lost. Thus, the functional pipeline is only 219 units. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand for the recent regime (P26-P32) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~102 units (P26-P32 samples: 114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84, 62), the effective inventory (0 on-hand + 219 functional pipeline) is insufficient to cover the lead time (3) plus review period (1). Specifically, 4 periods of demand at ~102/period requires ~408 units. The OR backend will be guided by an explicit mu_hat reflecting this (~102 * 4 = 408) and an explicit L = 3. This will trigger an order to replenish stock and safeguard against future stockouts during this higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed recent demand regime (P26-P32) mean is ~101.6 units with significant volatility (std ~26). Functional pipeline remains separated from 343 units of permanently lost early-period stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 562 units. However, based on the carry-over insights from Period 23 through Period 33, 343 of these units are confirmed lost shipments from early periods (specifically P2, P3, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The only 'functional' pipeline inventory is the 219 units ordered in Period 30. Given that Period 33 has concluded and these 219 units have not arrived yet (lead time > 3 periods), and considering the historical volatility where some orders are lost while others take 1-3 periods, there is a High risk that the P30 order is also delayed or lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The demand regime from P26-P33 averages approximately 91 units (114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84, 62, 58). I am setting L=3 to account for the observed late-cycle lead times and mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this specific demand regime. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, and the pipeline is erroneously high by 343 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~91 * 4 = 364) PLUS the 343 'ghost' units that the OR engine will incorrectly subtract, totaling 707. This ensures the backend actually places an order to replenish the current stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Functional pipeline of 219 units (from P30) is now 4 periods old and potentially lost, as max successful lead time recently observed was 3. Total lost stock in 'In-transit' view likely increased to 562 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 96 units/period (P26-P34: 114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84, 62, 58, 93). While volatility is present (std ~26), the current average is the primary driver for mu_hat. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' reported value of 707 units is heavily contaminated by lost stock. Historical analysis indicates that shipments from P19 and earlier (343 units) and potentially the P30 shipment of 219 units (now 5 periods old, exceeding the typical L=1-3 range) are lost. The functional pipeline consists only of the 145 units ordered in P34. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' as a subtraction from the base stock, but the backend's view of 'In-transit' (707) includes ~562 units of lost stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's calculation. I am setting mu_hat to cover a 4-period window (L+1 with L=3) at the 96 unit average (384) plus a safety buffer for volatility. I set L=3 as the planning lead time despite its volatility to ensure sufficient coverage for the longer tail of delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed total lost stock in 'In-transit' has likely risen to 562 units (343 early stock + 219 from P30). Active functional pipeline is only 145 units. Current demand regime (P26-P34) averages 96 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 707 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 562 units are confirmed lost shipments (343 units from orders prior to Period 20, and 219 units from Period 30 which is now 6 periods overdue relative to a nominal 2-3 period lead time). Only the order from Period 34 (145 units) is considered a functional part of the pipeline, though it is currently 2 periods old. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand from Period 26 to Period 35 averages 87.4 units/period, but excluding the zero-demand Period 25 and considering the 'higher mean' regime noted in previous insights, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current volatility and mean (approx 87 units). I set L=3 to account for the frequent actual lead time observed, which reduces order frequency and accounts for the latency. By using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat, I ensure the OR backend ignores the 'In-transit' phantom inventory caused by lost orders, treating the functional pipeline as only 145 units while targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total lost stock in 'In-transit' definitively includes 562 units (343 from early periods + 219 from P30). Only the 145 units from P34 are functionally in-transit. Demand regime (P26-P35) mean is 87.4 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a situation where the 'In-transit' figure of 562 units is entirely comprised of lost stock. Specifically, 343 units are from P19 and earlier, and 219 units are from the order in P30 (now 7 periods late, far exceeding the typical 1-3 period lead time). Effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. The most recent demand regime (P26-P36) reflects a mean of approximately 88.3 units per period. The most recent successful delivery (ordered P34, arrived P36) confirms a lead time of 2 periods, though we retain a base planning assumption of L=3 to account for historical volatility. With 51 units on hand and 0 in-transit, and an expected lead time of 2-3 periods, a significant order is needed to meet the demand of the next 3-4 periods (L+1). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (P26-P36) to capture the current demand volatility and level correctly.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed total lost stock in 'In-transit' is 562 units (343 from early periods + 219 from P30). Active functional pipeline is 0 units. Demand regime (P26-P36) mean is 88.3 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we have 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' of 562 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of lost shipments (343 units from early periods P6-P19 and 219 units from P30). The last successful arrivals were from P26 (L=2) and P34 (L=2), suggesting a current lead time of 2 periods. Demand has stabilized into a new regime starting roughly from P26; excluding the outlier zero at P25, the mean demand from P26 to P37 is approximately 89.1 units. With on-hand at 0 and active pipeline at 0, we must place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture this current regime and set L=2. The OR backend will see the 562 units in-transit, so I must set L and mu_hat such that the base stock calculation accounts for the high loss rate, or simply let the capped policy trigger a refill. Since the pipeline is 'contaminated', the explicit method for mu_hat is safest to ensure a substantial order is placed despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed total lost stock 'In-transit' is 562 units (343 early + 219 from P30). Active functional pipeline is 0 units. Recent demand regime (P26-P37) mean is 89.1 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 562 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are all lost shipments (343 units from orders prior to P20 and 219 units from the P30 order which is now 8 periods late). Consequently, effectively on-hand is 0 and functional pipeline is 0. The demand regime since P26 shows a mean of ~89.1 units with significant volatility. To recover from the stockout caused by the P30 loss and the exhaustion of P34 arrivals, I will re-establish the inventory position. I'm using the 'explicit' method for L to account for the frequent observed lead time of 3 periods, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters covering the current regime (N=13, from P26 to P38) to accurately capture the higher average demand and volatility compared to the P15-P25 slump.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Confirmed total lost stock in 'In-transit' is 562 units (343 early + 219 from P30). Active functional pipeline is 0 units. Recent demand regime (P26-P38) mean is ~89 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 562 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are lost shipments from early periods (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P30). The order from P30 (219 units) is now 10 periods old and definitively lost, given the recent successful lead time of 2 periods (observed in P26 and P34 orders). Consequently, the functional pipeline is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand from P26 to P39 has averaged approximately 89 units per period. Monitoring the high volatility and frequent order losses, I will set L to 2 (the most recent successful lead time) and use a recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime starting from P26. Since the OR engine's internal pipeline calculation is based on the reported 562 units, it will likely result in an order of 0. However, the OR backend logic subtracts pipeline from base_stock; if base_stock < 562, it will order nothing. To account for this, the 'explicit' method for L is set at 2 and recent_N for demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total lost stock 'In-transit' updated to 562 units by confirming the P30 order (219 units) is lost (10 periods elapsed). Active pipeline remains 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 562 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are all lost shipments (343 units from orders prior to Period 20 and 219 units from Period 30). The active functional pipeline is currently 0. Demand from Period 26 to Period 40 has stabilized into a new regime with a mean of approximately 92.6 units. Lead times for successful deliveries (P26 and P34) were both 2 periods. To recover from the current stockout (on-hand = 0), I will set the OR parameters to base stock calculations on this recent demand regime (last 15 periods) and the promised/recent lead time of 2. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will include the 562 lost units, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to effectively bypass the backend's inflated pipeline view. I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost inventory (92.6 * 3 + 562 = 840) to force the OR engine to place an order that treats the lost units as non-existent. Sigma is set based on the volatile nature of the recent regime (std ~26 over 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Confirmed total lost stock 'In-transit' remains 562 units. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime P26-P40 mean is 92.6 units. Planning must compensate for 562 units of phantom inventory in the OR engine.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we must manage a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the in-transit pipeline. Analysis of lead times confirms that orders from Periods 2, 3, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 30 are definitively lost. Summing these units (144+0+65+66+10+26+32+219) accounts for 562 units of the 840 currently reported 'In-transit'. Subtracting this from 840 leaves an active functional pipeline of 278 units (the order placed in P41), which is expected to arrive within 2-3 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P26-P41) has been higher and more volatile, averaging 92.6 units. To compensate for the 562 units of lost stock that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (Expected demand over L+1) + (Phantom Inventory) = (3 * 92.6) + 562 \u2248 840. This ensures the backend places the correct order size. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average 1-3 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed total lost stock (phantom inventory) in In-transit equals 562 units. Functional pipeline is currently 278 units (from P41). Demand regime (P26-P41) remains stable at a mean of ~93 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 840 units in-transit. However, based on the historical tracking of lost shipments (Carry-over insights), 562 of these units are confirmed lost (from Period 30 and earlier). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 278 units (ordered in Period 41). Demand regime analysis since Period 26 shows a mean of approximately 92.6 units (calculated through P40) but recent demand in P41 and P42 has spiked to 129 units. To compensate for the 'phantom inventory' (562 units) that the OR engine incorrectly thinks will arrive, I must increase mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 promised + 1 review). Calculating mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_correction: (3 * 93) + 562 = 841. This forces the OR engine to place an order that correctly accounts for the lost stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Recent demand (P41-P42) shows a spike to 129 units, potentially signaling a new higher-demand regime shifting the previous ~93 mean. Functional pipeline remains 278 units; phantom inventory persists at 562 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 841 units In-transit. Based on historical tracking, 562 units are confirmed lost (phantom inventory from P30 and earlier). A recent order of 278 units was placed in P41 and is currently 3 periods old (within the 1-3 period lead time range). A small order of 1 unit was placed in P43. Thus, the functional pipeline is 279 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted recently; while the P26-P40 mean was ~93, the last three periods (P41-P43) have seen a spike (129, 129, 104), suggesting a higher local mean near 121. To ensure the backend correctly triggers an order despite the 562 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L=3 (recent max) and mu_hat to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the recent higher mean of ~115, adjusted upward to offset the 562 units of phantom inventory that the OR core will incorrectly subtract from its target (Target = 460 + 562 = 1022).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed local demand surge P41-P43 (average 120.7 units). Functional pipeline is 279 (P41, P43 orders). Phantom In-transit stock remains 562 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the order from Period 41 (278 units) arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that recent lead times are averaging around 2.5\u20133 periods. The current demand regime (since Period 26) has stabilized around a mean of 92 units, though recent volatility is high. The 'In-transit' balance of 744 units is significantly inflated by 562 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (orders from P20 and earlier that are lost). This leaves a functional pipeline of 182 units (P43 order of 1, P44 order of 181). By setting L=3, the OR engine expects to cover 4 periods of demand ((L+1) * mean). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 562 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Theoretical base stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=3 and mu~100, (1+L)*mu = 400. However, the backend sees Pipeline=744, so it would order 0. To compensate, I set mu_hat = (400 + 562) = 962. This forces the engine to recognize the need for new stock despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed P41 order arrived with lead_time=3. Phantom inventory remains at 562 units. Recent demand mean (P26-P44) is approximately 92.4 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing chips(Regular) with a goal of maximizing profit while balancing inventory costs. Current on-hand inventory is 67. The reported 'In-transit' of 767 units includes 562 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 30 that will never arrive). This leaves a functional pipeline of 205 units (181 from P44 and 24 from P45). Recent lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (P41 took 3, P43 took 2). Demand has recently surged: the mean of the last 20 periods is 88.5, but the mean of the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 114.8. Given the tight inventory and the recent demand spike, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers this higher demand regime and avoids stockouts, while using an explicit L of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Functional pipeline updated to 205 units; 562 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory. Recent demand regime (P41-P45) shows a higher mean of 114.8 units compared to the previous long-term average.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 767 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis indicates that 562 units of this are 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 30). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from P44 (181 units) and P45 (24 units), totaling 205 units. Recent demand (P41-P46) has shifted higher, averaging 115.5 units per period. Since on-hand inventory is 0, setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat is necessary to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the contaminated 'In-transit' figure. mu_hat is set to 462 (115.5 * (1 + 3)) and sigma_hat is set to 44 (standard deviation of ~22 for recent high-demand periods multiplied by sqrt(1+3)). This ensures the order covers the required base stock while accounting for the ~562 units of lost stock that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed functional pipeline is 205 units; 562 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments. Recent demand regime (P41-P46) mean has stabilized at ~115.5 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 767 units. Based on historical tracking, 562 units of this are 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30). The active functional pipeline contains orders from P44 (181 units) and P45 (24 units), totaling 205 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0, the total functional position is 205 units. Demand since P41 has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging 115.8 units per period (P41-P47). To protect against this higher demand and account for the 562 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes is coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted Demand (mean 115.8) x (1 + Lead Time 2) = 347.4. To offset the 562 phantom units, I must add them to the base stock calculation target since the OR engine will subtract the full 767. Target base_stock should be ~347 (demand) + ~562 (offset) = 909. Using L=2 as the most common lead time despite recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Functional pipeline is 205 units. Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains constant at 562 units. Demand regime (P41-P47) is stable at ~115.8 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 909 units is misleading; as documented in Carry-over Insights, 562 units are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P30 and earlier). Subtracting these, the functional pipeline is 347 units (consisting of orders from P44: 181, P45: 24, and P48: 142). The actual lead time has stabilized between 2-3 periods (P41 took 3, P43 took 2). Demand has entered a higher regime since P41, moving from ~93 to ~110.8 units/period (average of P41-P48). Given P49 is near the end of the simulation (total 50 periods), we must ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 2 periods (P49, P50) while accounting for the lead time delay. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this elevated demand regime and explicit lead time L=2 to reflect recent observations while accounting for the immediate 1-period observation gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: mean increased from ~93 to ~110.8 units based on P41-P48 data. Functional pipeline inventory correctly identified as 347 units (In-transit 909 - Phantom 562).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final period. On-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit reported is 909 units. Based on historical analysis, 562 units are documented phantom inventory (lost shipments from P30 and prior). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 347 units (909 minus 562), which includes orders from P44 (181 units), P45 (24 units), and P48 (142 units). Since P49 concludes and we are at the decision phase for P50, and we have 0 on-hand inventory, the OR backend needs to evaluate the base stock against the functional pipeline. The demand regime has shifted since Period 41 to a higher mean (avg P41-P49 \u2248 108 units) with moderate volatility. Lead time is averaging 2.5 periods (recently 2-3). Setting L=3 (explicit) to be safe against delays, mu_hat based on the recent 9 periods (P41-P49), and sigma_hat based on the same period to capture the recent regime's volatility. Note: The OR engine sees 'In-transit: 909', so to correct for the 562 phantom units and ensure it orders enough to cover demand, I will set L to 3 and use explicit values that compensate for the backend's subtraction of the 562 ghost units from the calculated base stock.
