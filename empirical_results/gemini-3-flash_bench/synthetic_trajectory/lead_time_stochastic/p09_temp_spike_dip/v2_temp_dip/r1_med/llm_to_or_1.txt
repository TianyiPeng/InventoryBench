Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The backend OR logic uses the Base Stock policy where base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Given the initial demand history (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the mean is approximately 100 units/period. Adjusting for (1+L) = 3 periods, mu_hat should be around 300. Since we have zero inventory and must cover demand during the lead time plus the current period, I am setting parameters to default to leverage the initial samples. The OR engine will calculate the service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8, resulting in a z-score of ~0.84 to balance stockouts and holding costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 2. As per the game mechanics, the 'Period 1 conclude' message correctly shows 0 units arrived because an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 89 lost sales from Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including those provided in the snapshot) shows values of 118, 130, 72, 58, 121, and the most recent Period 1 demand of 89. The mean of these 6 samples is ~98. Given the high stockout cost ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. I will use 'default' methods to allow the system to use the full historical mean and the promised lead time of 2, which are appropriate at this early stage before a clear regime shift or lead-time deviation is confirmed.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (154 units) and Period 2 (147 units) are in-transit (total 301). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase (visible in Period 3's conclude message read at Period 4). Therefore, current zero on-hand and zero sales are expected due to the 2-period lag. Historical demand (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) averaged ~100. Recent demand samples provided in history (89, 41) suggest a potential downward trend or high variance, but with only 2 periods of observation, I will stick to the default statistical methods to allow the OR backend to aggregate the provided historical data. L is set to default (promised 2). Forecasts will utilize all available samples to establish a baseline until arrivals begin and sales data matures.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (154 units) and Period 2 (147 units) were expected to arrive during Periods 3 and 4 respectively. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message confirms that zero units arrived in Period 3. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost sales for three consecutive periods, we must account for this delay. For Period 4, the demand samples are [118, 130, 72, 58, 121] with a mean of 99.8. I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect the observed delay and use the recent 5 demand samples to project future needs. The goal is to set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (4 periods) while the OR backend's capped policy prevents excessive over-ordering if the pipeline suddenly clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the history of 'chips(Regular)'. We observe that the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4, establishing an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 59 units, and there are 219 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 4). Historical demand over the first four periods (89, 41, 91, 95) shows an average of 79 units per period, while the pre-game samples provided (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) averaged around 100. Given the lead time of 3, we need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 based on the observed arrival from Period 1. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to incorporate the most recent samples and the game history, totaling 4 periods of coverage at an average of approximately 80-100 per period. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead time is 3 (P1 order arrived in P4). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in P5, though 340 units are in transit (147 from P2, 72 from P4, 121 from P5). I expect the P2 order (147 units) to arrive during P6 since it was placed 4 periods ago and the observed lead time is 3. Demand over the last 5 periods (89, 41, 91, 95, 97) averages 82.6 units. However, demand in P2 seems like an outlier (41); excluding it, the average is ~93. Given the Lead Time (L) is effectively 3, I need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will set L to 3 explicitly and use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand trend seen in P1, P3, P4, and P5, ignoring the P2 outlier to ensure adequate stock levels and prevent further lost sales.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but historical data (Period 4) confirms an actual lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 370 units includes orders from Period 2 (147), Period 4 (72), Period 5 (121), and Period 6 (30). Based on the 3-period lead time, the Period 2 order (147 units) was expected in Period 5, and the Period 4 order (72 units) was expected in Period 7. Neither has arrived yet, indicating either a further lead time extension or lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts. Demand appears to be stabilizing around 95-97 units per period from Period 4-6, significantly higher than the initial samples (58-130 range). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the discovered lead time. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent stable demand of ~96 and allow for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for (1+3) periods. Sigma_hat is set to 10 (explicit) becauseRecent demand variance is extremely low (95, 97, 96), which justifies a tighter safety stock than the high-variance initial periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains volatile: Period 2 order (147 units) is now 2 periods overdue based on the observed 3-period lead time; potential for lost shipments or severe delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of lead times shows that the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3) and the Period 4 order arrived in Period 7 (L=3), confirming a consistent actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (147 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived; according to the 'L=3' pattern, it should have arrived in Period 5. This shipment is highly likely lost or severely delayed. The order from Period 5 (121 units) should arrive in Period 8 (visible in Period 9), and the order from Period 6 (30 units) in Period 9. Demand is averaging approximately 90-100 units per period. I am setting L=3 to reflect reality. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (approx 98 units/period) to capture the slight upward trend in recent samples (95, 97, 96, 112). I am setting sigma_hat to explicit=40 to account for the current stockout risk and the high variability introduced by the lost shipment in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 shipment (147 units) confirmed lost/severely delayed (6 periods elapsed vs L=3). Updated lead time baseline to 3 periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful shipments (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). The P2 order is now 7 periods old and significantly exceeds the observed 3-period lead time, confirming it is lost. In Period 8, we saw a rare 1-period arrival (P7 order), but the 3-period baseline is more reliable for safety stock. On-hand inventory is 54 and pipeline inventory is 283 (excluding the lost P2 order but including P6 and P8 orders). Average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 89 units. I set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent reality over the promised 2. I set mu_hat to (1+3)*95 = 380 using a recent N of 5 to account for the slightly higher recent demand average (~98 units), and sigma_hat is set to the default calculation based on L=3.

Carry-over insight: Lead time baseline solidified at 3 periods despite a single 1-period outlier in Period 8. Demand remains stable around 95 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $545.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain shows significant lead-time variability. While the promised lead time is 2, historical data reveals a mix of results: Period 1, 4, and 5 orders arrived in 3 periods, while Period 7 and 8 orders arrived in 1 period, and the Period 2 order is lost. Given this instability and the history of stockouts (Ending inventory was 0 in Periods 1-3, 5-7), I will set L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer (L+1 coverage). On-hand inventory is 19 with 275 in-transit. Demand has shown a recent spike (141 in P9) but averages around 95-100. I will use the last 5 periods (avg ~107) for forecasting to capture this recent volatility while maintaining the L=3 assumption to protect service levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly inconsistent: observed values of 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 alongside a confirmed lost shipment. Demand volatility increased in Period 9 (141 units).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (Ending Inventory 0) with a history of lead time volatility and lost shipments. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been {3, 3, 3, 1, 1}, and the Period 2 order is confirmed lost. My 'In-transit' balance of 417 units includes the Period 2 order (147 units) which should be excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. To achieve this in the OR backend, I will set L to 'explicit' value 3, which is the conservative mode of the observed lead times. Demand has averaged ~95 units, but Period 9 saw a spike (141). To protect against current stockouts and pipeline uncertainty, I will use mu_hat 'explicit' for (1+L)*mean demand \u2248 4 * 100 = 400, and a higher sigma_hat to increase the safety stock (z-score for 0.8 service level is ~0.84).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline recalculation required: Period 2 order (147 units) is confirmed lost; total effective in-transit is current 417 - 147 = 270 units.

However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', the order from Period 2 (147 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed (now 10 periods past placement). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 440 - 147 = 293 units. The stock situation is critical as we have 0 on-hand and have experienced several stockouts. Lead times have been highly volatile (observed: 3, 3, 3, 1, 1), requiring a conservative L estimate. I will set L to 3 (the mode of reliable arrivals) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient look-ahead. For demand, the recent average (last 5 periods) is approximately 107 units per period. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the slight increase in demand (including the Period 9 spike) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the updated L=3 and these demand parameters, helping to recover the inventory position given the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Effective pipeline confirmed as 293 units (440 total minus 147 units from lost Period 2 order).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2). The notorious Period 2 shipment of 147 units is now 11 periods past its order date and 8 periods past its expected 3-period arrival; it is officially confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' visible to the backend is 222 units, which accurately reflects orders from Period 11 (23 units), Period 12 (22 units), and should represent the remainder of the pipeline. However, looking at the 'In-transit' reported (222), and knowing our recent orders (P11=23, P12=22), there is 177 units unaccounted for. This likely includes the Period 6 order (30 units) which is now overdue. Adjusted pipeline for OR logic (on-hand 87 + in-transit 222) is 309. Average demand has slightly ticked up with Period 9 (141) and Period 12 (153), moving the mean from ~95 to ~100. Lead times have been 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2. I will use L=3 to remain conservative against the high volatility. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=8 to capture the recent demand surge while maintaining stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 2 shipment (147 units) is confirmed lost. Period 6 order (30 units) is currently overdue (LT=7). Demand mean has shifted from ~95 to ~105 over the last 5 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting the 87 units starting inventory against a demand of 130 in Period 13. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 372 units. However, we must reconcile the lost/overdue shipments. The Period 2 order (147 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 6 order (30 units) is now 8 periods old, which is significantly beyond the observed lead times (range 1-3) and is likely lost or severely delayed. Adjusting the effective pipeline: 372 - 147 (P2) - 30 (P6) = 195 units. The actual lead time (L) has stabilized between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts. Demand shows a rising trend, with the last 5 periods averaging ~122.6 (141, 100, 89, 153, 130), compared to the earlier ~95. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime, preparing for (L+1) or 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 6 order (30 units) confirmed lost/severely delayed (8 periods elapsed vs max observed L=3). Recent 5-period demand average increased to ~123 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of demand across several periods. Lead time analysis shows a high level of instability. While the promised lead time is 2, historical observations from CONCLUDED periods are [3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3], with two confirmed lost orders (Period 2 - 147 units, Period 6 - 30 units). Calculating the effective pipeline: current in-transit (514) minus lost units (147 + 30) gives 337 units effectively in-transit. For parameters: 1) Lead time L is set to explicit '3' based on the most frequent actual lead time observed. 2) Demand mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent upward shift in mean demand (~123 units/period). 3) Sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent samples (97 to 153). Using these methods helps the OR backend target a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4) while acknowledging the persistent unreliability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: last 5 periods average ~123 units (compared to early-game ~95). Lead time remains unreliable but centers on 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaged 110.6 units, but the broader recent trend (P9-P15) suggests a mean of 113.4. The lead time is extremely volatile, with confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6) and observed values typically centering around 3 periods. The 'In-transit' of 492 units is heavily inflated by these lost orders (147 from P2 and 30 from P6), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 492 - 177 = 315 units. To ensure availability given a 3-period lead time, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). With demand around 113/period, 4 periods = 452 units. Our effective pipeline (315) is significantly below this, requiring a substantial order. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the likely arrival time and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the sustained higher volume compared to early-game while accounting for recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 107. The 'In-transit' quantity is reported as 343, but history indicates two lost shipments: Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units), totaling 177 units. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 166 units (343 - 177). The lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3). Demand has shown a recent shift; while the long-term average is lower, the mean over the last 5 periods (excluding the anomalously low Period 16) was approximately 101 units. Period 16 demand dropped to 43, suggesting either a temporary dip or high volatility. Given the 107 on-hand and 166 effective in-transit, the current effective inventory position is 273. Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 12-16) to capture the higher recent demand regime while acknowledging the latest fluctuation. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to ensure sufficient safety stock given the high demand variance and lead-time inconsistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has significantly cooled down over the last three periods (84, 43, 39) compared to the elevated levels seen between Periods 12-14 (153, 130, 97). The last 3 periods average ~55 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 234 units due to the arrival of 166 units in Period 17 (from Period 14 and 16 orders). The lead time remains unstable but appears to cluster around 3 periods for regular shipments, with occasional 1-period outliers. The Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units) orders are permanently lost. Subtracting these from the 'In-transit' figure of 182 leaves an effective pipeline of 5 units (the order from Period 17). Given the recent drop in demand and high current on-hand inventory, I am setting L=3 to reflect the consistent arrival pattern and using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current downward trend in demand while maintaining enough coverage to avoid stockouts if demand recovers slightly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Last 3 periods show a sharp decrease in demand (avg ~55) compared to the previous high-demand regime (avg ~123). Pipeline remains clear of the lost Period 2 and Period 6 orders.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a significant downward shift in demand for chips(Regular). The last four demands (Periods 15-18) were 84, 43, 39, and 78, averaging ~61 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~123. The carry-over insight from P18 confirms this regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently high (156 units) due to the arrival of P14 and P16 orders in P17, which exceeded the recent lower demand. Total in-transit inventory is 182 units (P15 was 0, but P13, P14, P16 arrived; P17 ordered 5; P18 ordered 0). Checking history: P17(5 units), P13(150 units - already arrived), P14(165 units - already arrived), P16(1 unit - already arrived). Wait, In-transit view (182) must include orders from P17(5) and potentially earlier pending orders not yet concluded or reconciled. However, given the plummeting demand (recent_N=4 mean is ~61), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to avoid over-ordering. Lead time (L) has stabilized primarily around 3 periods despite some variance, so I set L=3 explicitly. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of this new low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 16-18 show persistent low demand (avg ~53) compared to early periods. Pipeline inventory reconciled against lost shipments (P2, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While Periods 12-14 saw a peak (avg ~126), the last 5 periods (Periods 15-19) show a sharp decline to an average of 57.4 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 50.75 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this deceleration and prevent excessive overstocking, as the current on-hand inventory (113) and in-transit (182) are quite high relative to this new demand level. Lead times have also fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent mode and the promised lead time being 2. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the observed variability (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3). The pipeline inventory of 182 units is confirmed to exclude the lost orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (as previously reconciled in carry-over insights).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean for periods 15-19 dropped significantly to ~57 units per period from previous highs of ~120.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted to a lower level. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 50.8 units (43, 39, 78, 43, 51), a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~123. The carry-over insights also confirm this sustained shift. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower average. Lead times continue to be volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. Given the 'in-transit' inventory of 182 units (P17-P20 orders) and on-hand inventory of 62, we are well-covered for the current low-demand environment. I will use L=3 (explicit) to reflect the typical delay, ensuring the base-stock calculation accounts for the likely arrival horizon. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting around Period 16. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 52 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime which averaged over 120 units. Lead times remain inconsistent, with observed values including 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, however the most frequent and stable expectation is 3 periods. Given the current low demand, the on-hand inventory of 5 units plus the in-transit inventory of 182 units (P2 and P6 orders are now excluded as they were confirmed lost in previous periods) is likely sufficient to cover several periods. Since 182 units far exceed the 4-period cycle stock requirement (1+L=4 periods * ~52 demand = 208 units), but the pipeline is already quite full for this low-demand state, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the localized low-demand regime and stable 3-period lead time baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower mean following a regime shift around Period 16. For the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is 50.4 units, a significant drop from the previous high-demand period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline contains 227 units (consisting of the Period 17 order of 5 units and the Period 22 order of 45 units, plus historical un-arrived orders). However, past insights confirm orders from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units) are lost. Excluding these lost units, the effective pipeline is 50 units (5 + 45). Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a conservative lead time estimate of 3 is appropriate to ensure service levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand regime and L=3 (explicit) to account for the actual delivery delays observed despite the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed low-demand regime persistent for 7 periods (P16-P22) with an average of ~50 units/period. Effective pipeline is 50 units after netting out confirmed lost orders from P2 (147 units) and P6 (30 units).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. The demand in Period 23 was 80, which is higher than the recent 7-period average (~50). This suggests a possible rebound or the end of the low-demand regime observed from P16-P22. The in-transit inventory of 182 contains confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units). The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 182 - (147 + 30) = 5 units. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 2 to represent the average operational lead time. For demand, I will use a recent window of 8 samples (P16-P23) to capture the low-demand phase while incorporating the recent uptick (average ~54). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the established regime and the latest data point.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Potential demand rebound detected in Period 23 (80 units) following a 7-period low (avg ~50). Effective pipeline confirmed as 5 units after accounting for lost orders (P2, P6).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 25. The stock on-hand is 0, and the demand in Period 24 was 34 units. We are in a low-demand regime that has persisted since Period 16, though it saw a brief spike to 80 in Period 23. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 52 units. The lead time has been inconsistent but frequently settles around 3 periods, with recent observations of 1 period (P23). Since P2 and P6 orders (total 177 units) are confirmed lost, the effective in-transit inventory is 187 - 177 = 10 units (specifically, the 5 units ordered in P24 and 5 units ordered in P17). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer lead times, and use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Effective pipeline verified at 10 units after netting lost P2 (147) and P6 (30) shipments. Current demand regime stabilized around 52 units/period (P16-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a lower-demand phase since Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 51.9 units/period. Period 23 saw a minor spike (80), but subsequent periods (34, 68) suggest the mean remains near ~52. Lead times are highly variable but frequently center around 3 periods. The 'In-transit' of 236 units includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units). Real pipeline = 236 - 147 - 30 = 59 units (consisting of orders from P17 (5), P24 (5), and P25 (49)). These 59 units plus future orders need to cover demand over the lead time (L=3) plus the review period (total L+1 = 4). With on-hand at 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current regime (~52 * 4) and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand regime for P16-P25 confirmed at avg ~52 units/period. Effective pipeline correctly reconciled as 59 units (236 total - 147 lost P2 - 30 lost P6).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand analysis (P23-P26: 80, 34, 68, 106) indicates a significant upward shift from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~52). The last 4 periods average 72 units, which is a 38% increase. Lead times remain inconsistent (1-3 periods, plus lost orders). Total in-transit is 242, but after accounting for confirmed lost orders from P2 (147 units) and P6 (30 units), the effective pipeline is actually 65 units (242 - 147 - 30). Given the stockout and the rising demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the rebound, and sticking with the calculated lead time which reflects the actual variability (centering around 3).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand rebound confirmed; average of last 4 periods (P23-P26) is 72 units/period, compared to the P16-P22 average of ~50. Effective pipeline reconciled at 65 units after subtracting lost shipments from P2 and P6.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 units on-hand and an in-transit balance of 315 units. After accounting for the confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units), the effective pipeline inventory is 138 units. Demand has rebounded significantly from the previous low-demand regime (P16-P22 avg ~50); the average over the last five periods (P23-P27) is 82.6 units. Given the high demand in Period 26 (106) and Period 27 (125), I am adopting a more aggressive recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this upward shift. For lead time, I am setting L to 3 manually, as it has been the most consistent actual lead time for large shipments, despite recent volatility. This configuration aims to build stock to meet the increased demand levels while the pipeline recovers.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand rebound confirmed; last 5 periods (P23-P27) average 82.6 units, a 65% increase over the previous regime. Effective pipeline recalculated at 138 units (315 total - 177 lost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third distinct regime. After a low period (P16-P22 avg ~50), demand has rebounded significantly over the last 6 periods (P23-P28), averaging approximately 86.6 units per period. The most recent demand (P27: 125, P28: 107) suggests even higher potential volatility and level. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this rebound. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 348 units is misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units). The effective pipeline is actually 171 units (348 - 177). Lead times remain inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the system is protected against the likely longer arrival delay. These parameters (L=3, mu_hat based on the last 6 samples reflecting the rebound) aim to raise the base stock and recover from the current stockout (On-hand: 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound solidified: P23-P28 average is 86.6 units/period (65%+ increase over P16-P22 regime). Effective pipeline reconciled at 171 units by subtracting lost shipments from P2 (147) and P6 (30) from the reported 348.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a higher-demand regime over the last seven periods (P23-P29), with an average demand of ~91 units per period, compared to the previous low of ~52. Specifically, the last three periods (P27-P29) averaged ~116 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this rebound while providing some buffer against volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the increased variance in this new regime. Regarding lead time (L), although the promised lead time is 2, the actual history shows high volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). I will use L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. The effective in-transit quantity must be adjusted: total reported In-transit is 330 units, but P2 (147 units) and P6 (30 units) are confirmed lost. Thus, effective pipeline = 330 - 177 = 153 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified: average demand for P23-P29 is 91.4 units/period, a significant increase from the P16-P22 average of 50.6. Recent 3-period average (P27-P29) is even higher at 116 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-growth regime starting at Period 23. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P28-P30) has stabilized at a high level (107, 116, 117), with a 5-period average (P26-P30) of 114.2 units/period. The current effective pipeline is calculated by taking the reported In-transit (379) and subtracting confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units), resulting in 202 units. Lead times have recently shown more stability at 2 periods (last three arrivals: P26, P27, P28), though the structural baseline remains closer to 3. I am setting L=3 to be safe against delays. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (114.2 * 4) to capture the current elevated demand level. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (std=6.6 * 2) to account for the consistent nature of this high-demand cluster. This configuration ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of the current high-demand regime while correcting for 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified: P26-P30 average is 114.2 units/period, representing a sustained return to (and slight exceeding of) early-game peaks. Lead time for the last three successful shipments (ordered P26, P27, P28) has consistently been 2 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is clearly in a high-demand phase. The last 5 periods (P27-P31) show an average of 122.6 units per period, with P31 reaching 148 units. I will use a 5-period window to capture this sustained rebound. Regarding lead time, the last three successful consecutive arrivals (ordered P26, P27, P28) all exhibited a lead time of 2 periods, signaling a stabilization back to the promised baseline. However, I must account for the pipeline reconciliation: the total reported in-transit is 471 units, which includes 147 units (P2) and 30 units (P6) confirmed as lost shipments. The effective pipeline is actually 471 - 177 = 294 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 'ghost' inventory in its pipeline count, I will set L=2 (actual) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units (122.6 * 3 + 177 \u2248 545). This over-ordering compensates for the lost units that the OR engine wrongly thinks are coming.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound verified: P27-P31 average is 122.6 units/period. Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last three concluded shipments.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly rebounded and stabilized at a high level. Since Period 27, demand has averaged approximately 121.2 units per period (125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98). I am using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand state for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead time, the last four arrivals show a stabilized pattern: Period 26 order (LT=2), Period 27 order (LT=2), Period 28 order (LT=2), and Period 31 order (LT=1). This suggests the earlier extreme delays have resolved into a more consistent 1-2 period range. I will use recent_N=4 for L to reflect this improved reliability. Current on-hand is 0, and units in-transit total 476. After accounting for the confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units), the effective pipeline is 299 units. This pipeline is being reconciled against a base stock target designed for a lead time of roughly 1.75 periods plus the decision period, which aligns with the current elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P27-P32 average is 119 units/period. Lead time has significantly improved and stabilized, with the last four successful arrivals occurring within 1-2 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted upward and stabilized. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 33 is approximately 117.7 units per period. Lead times have also improved significantly, with the last two arrivals (Period 32 and 33) arriving in only 1 period. However, given the historical volatility and the presence of lost shipments (P2 and P6), I will conservatively use a lead time of 2 for safety while calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat. The 'In-transit' figure of 379 includes 177 units from lost shipments (P2: 147, P6: 30), meaning the effective pipeline is actually 202 units. The OR backend needs to cover the next (L+1) periods of demand. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this new high-demand regime effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P27-P33): average ~118 units/period. Effective pipeline calculation must exclude 177 units from historical lost orders (P2, P6).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized at a high level. Demand for the last 8 periods (P27-P34) averages 118.25 units, representing a sustained rebound to early-game peaks. Lead times have recently improved, appearing to settle between 1-2 periods. However, there is a recurring issue with 'In-transit' accounting: 177 units (147 from P2 and 30 from P6) are long-lost and must be manually netted out. The effective pipeline is actual In-transit (379) minus lost units (177), which equals 202 units. Given current on-hand is 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand ~118, the target base stock is ~354. Since effective pipeline (202) is less than this target, an order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods to capture this high-demand regime and L=2 to reflect the recent stabilized shipping performance.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent active period (P27-P35), the average demand is approximately 115 units per period. The standard deviation in this regime is approximately 19 units. Lead times have also stabilized significantly, with the last five arrivals (P26, P27, P28, P31, P32) showing lead times of 2, 2, 2, 1, and 1 periods respectively, averaging 1.6 periods. For the OR parameters, I will use L=2 (promised and conservative recent average). mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 115 = 345. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L) * 19 \u2248 33. Regarding the pipeline, the reported In-transit is 379 units. We must subtract the historical lost shipments from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units), totaling 177 units. The effective in-transit is therefore 379 - 177 = 202 units. With on-hand at 0, the total inventory position is 202. Since the target base stock (345 + safety stock) is well above 202, the OR engine will place a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand regime for P27-P35 stabilized at ~115 units/period. Lead time over the last 5 arrivals averages 1.6 periods, effectively stabilizing at L=2.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a high-demand phase that started around Period 27, though recent samples (P35: 88, P36: 67) show a tapering off from the peak of ~148. The average demand for the rebound period (P27-P36) is approximately 108 units/period. The lead time has stabilized significantly, with the last several arrivals showing 1-2 periods. I will use L=2 as the operational baseline. Regarding inventory: the 'In-transit' figure of 379 units includes 177 units from two historically lost orders (P2: 147 units and P6: 30 units), which have not arrived for over 30 periods. Thus, the effective pipeline is 379 - 177 = 202 units. Given current on-hand is 0 and demand is ~108, the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be around 324 plus a safety buffer. With 202 effective units in transit, the OR backend needs to target a base stock that covers the remaining gap. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the full rebound and recent taper, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 2, which aligns with recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as 202 units (Reported 379 - 177 lost units from P2 and P6). Demand regime for P27-P36 averages 108.2 units/period, showing a slight cooling from the peak of 122.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime following a rebound from an earlier lull. Calculating the average demand from Period 27 to Period 37, the mean is approximately 108 units per period, showing a slight cooling from the peak around Period 31 but remaining significantly higher than the mid-game average. Lead times have become more consistent, averaging 1.6 periods over the last five successful arrivals, though I'll continue to use L=2 as a safe baseline since recent arrivals were 1-2 periods. Inventory management remains critical as there are 177 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (Period 2: 147 units, Period 6: 30 units). The reported in-transit of 379 units actually contains only 202 units of valid pipeline inventory. With 0 on-hand, I must ensure current parameters allow the OR engine to order enough to cover the lead time + review period demand (approx 3 * 108 = 324 units) against the effective pipeline of 202 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are observing a total stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline of 379 units. Analysis of history shows that 177 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving an effective pipeline of 202 units. The demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime; the average for the most recent period (P27-P38) is approximately 107 units/period. Lead times for the last several successful deliveries have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods. To maximize reward, I must ensure the inventory position (on-hand + effective in-transit) covers the (L+1) period demand window. Using L=2 and a recent demand average prevents over-ordering while accounting for the lost units in the backend's 'cap' calculation through the choice of parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Effective pipeline remains 202 units (379 total - 177 lost from P2 and P6). Demand regime for P27-P38 remains stable at ~107 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime, with an average of approximately 107 units per period over the last 13 periods (P27-P39). Although demand fluctuates, it consistently centers around this mark. Currently, the system shows an In-transit total of 379 units. However, consistent history (recorded in carry-over insights) confirms that 177 of these units (from P2 and P6) are lost or indefinitely delayed. The effective pipeline is therefore 202 units (379 - 177). On-hand inventory is 0, and lead times have recently averaged 2 periods. To maintain a service level consistent with a profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 (target service level ~80%), I am setting L to 2, mu_hat to reflects the current regime (N=13), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 14 periods (P27-P40), the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 111 units per period (e.g., P38: 108, P39: 126, P40: 124). The inventory situation is critical: current on-hand is 0, and while the reported In-transit is 379 units, we must account for historical lost shipments from Period 2 (147 units) and Period 6 (30 units). This results in an effective pipeline of 202 units (379 - 177). Since we have not placed an order since Period 32 and no arrivals have occurred since Period 33, we are facing a significant stockout. I am setting L to 2 (the stabilized lead time observed between P28-P33) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current high-demand regime (~111/period), which covers (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. This will trigger the OR engine to place a large recovery order to replenish the depleted pipeline and address the persistent stockouts.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are facing a critical inventory stockout with 0 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 202 units (Reported 379 minus 177 lost from P2 and P6). The system shows no arrivals since Period 33, while demand has remained robust. Historically, orders from P2 to P32 were consistently placed, but the user history shows a gap in ordering from P33 to P41. Demand for the most recent period (P41) was 78, and the average since the rebound (P27-P41) is approximately 107.5 units. Current pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit (379) - Lost P2 (147) - Lost P6 (30) = 202 effective units. However, looking at the order history, no new orders were recorded since P32 (where 97 units were ordered and arrived in P33). This implies the 'In-transit' figure or the user history provided might be contradictory or reflecting very old/stuck shipments. Given the current 0 on-hand and consistent demand of ~108, I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods (rebound regime) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand level. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average (approx 1.6-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: System inventory discrepancy: Total In-transit is 379 but no arrivals have occurred for 8 periods despite high demand. Effective pipeline calculation (minus P2 and P6 lost units) leaves 202 units, but these are likely also lost/stalled as they haven't arrived within the established 2-3 period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain crisis. No arrivals have occurred since Period 33, despite multiple orders being placed. The total In-transit is reported as 413 units, but historical evidence suggests a significant portion of this is lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (147 units) and P6 (30 units) are confirmed lost (Carry-over). Subtracting these leaves a 'live' pipeline of 236 units. However, orders from P29 (55 units), P30 (88 units), and P31 (92 units) are now 11+ periods overdue, which is far beyond the established lead time of 2-3 periods. This implies that most, if not all, of the current pipeline is non-functional. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has averaged 106.2 units. To prevent total stockout for the remainder of the game (8 periods), I must place aggressive orders while treating the stalled pipeline as zero. I will set L=3 to account for the supply instability, and mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (approx 106 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Pipeline integrity compromised. Current In-transit of 413 likely contains ~380 units of lost/stalled shipments (P2, P6, P25, P29, P30, P31). Effective pipeline is near zero.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the supply chain remains in a critical failure state. No shipments have arrived since Period 33, despite consistent demand and multiple orders. Total reported In-transit is 459 units, but historical analysis from Carry-over Insights identifies that at least 177 units (from P2 and P6) are long-lost. Furthermore, orders from P25, P29, P30, and P31 (totaling ~284 units) are now extremely overdue (12+ periods), suggesting they are also lost or permanently stalled. Effectively, the 'real' pipeline is near zero until the most recent orders (P42, P43) potentially arrive. Demand since P27 has averaged approximately 107 units/period, despite recent fluctuations. I must set OR parameters to trigger aggressive ordering to overcome the phantom inventory in the pipeline. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the current severe delays, 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the stable high-demand regime since P27) to capture the ~107 unit mean, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock. This configuration forces the OR engine to recognize the need for significant new stock while discounting the stalled pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P34-P44). Effective pipeline remains near zero as 100% of 'In-transit' units prior to P42 are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extended disruption. There have been no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P33-P44). Based on the history, orders from P2 (147 units) and P6 (30 units) are long-confirmed lost. Furthermore, orders from P25 (49), P29 (55), P30 (88), and P42 (34) are also significantly overdue compared to the previously established 2-3 period lead time, suggesting they are either lost or caught in a major backlog. The reported In-transit of 473 units consists entirely of these likely-lost or stalled units. Consequently, the 'effective' pipeline is treated as zero. Demand has cooled slightly from its peak (~118) to an average of ~84 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). I will set L to 3 (the upper end of historical reliability) and use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to account for the recent cooling while maintaining enough stock to capture potential upside if shipments resume. The OR backend will see 0 on-hand and 473 in-transit; however, because my mu_hat is based on (1+L) * mean, the base stock calculation will likely trigger a new order to fill the gap, as the 'stalled' pipeline is ignored in my internal logic to force higher ordering during this shortage.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 12 periods without arrivals (P33-P44). All 473 units in-transit are considered stalled or lost. Demand cooled to ~84 units/period (P40-P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed after a 12-period blackout (P33-P44). Arrivals in Period 45 (orders from P42 and P43) confirm that the system is again processing new orders with a lead time of 2-3 periods, while older \u2018In-transit\u2019 units (orders from P25, P29, P30, P31) are definitively lost or permanently stalled. Current on-hand is 0. The effective pipeline inventory consists only of the order from P44 (14 units), as the total in-transit of 393 includes 379 units from the historical collapse. Demand has recently fluctuated but remains robust, with Period 45 reaching 130 units. To rebuild inventory while accounting for the recent demand volatility and the 'new' lead time baseline, I am setting L to 3 and using a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~85 units/period) while ignoring the extreme fluctuations of the collapse period. This will signal the OR engine to place a significant order to cover the (L+1) window, minus the single valid 14-unit order in transit.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed Period 45: orders from P42/P43 arrived with 2-3 period lead times. Total In-transit (393) contains 379 lost units from the P33-P44 collapse; effective pipeline as of Period 46 is only 14 units (from P44).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed after a severe 12-period disruption. In Period 45, shipments from P42 and P43 arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively, confirming that the logistics channel is functioning for new orders. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 393 is heavily inflated by 379 units from historical lost orders (P2, P6, P25, P29, P30, P31) that are unlikely to ever arrive. The legitimate effective pipeline is only 14 units (from P44). Demand has stabilized at a moderate level; the average for the last 7 periods (P40-P46) is 92.4 units. I will set L=2 (reflecting the recent successful deliveries) and mu_hat to cover this demand level (92.4 * (1+2) = 277). I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain service levels while accounting for the high ratio of lost units in the reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed in Period 45 with lead times of 2-3 periods for recent orders. Reported In-transit (393) contains 379 units from legacy lost shipments (P2, P6, P25, P29, P30, P31), meaning effective pipeline is effectively 14 units (ordered P44).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain resumed functionality in Period 45, but deliveries remain inconsistent. Demand is currently in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 102 units over the last 5 active periods (P43-P47). The reported In-transit of 393 units is heavily distorted by legacy stalled/lost shipments from previous supply chain collapses (Period 2, 6, 25, 29, 30, 31). Specifically, 379 units are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled. The order from Period 44 (14 units) has not yet arrived and is the only 'real' pipeline inventory. Current On-hand is 0. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase near the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods of demand to capture the current mean (~102), and assuming a lead time of 2 periods (based on the successful arrivals in Period 45). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 14 units currently actually in-transit.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. Demand has recently averaged 99.8 units/period (P44-P48). In-transit is reported as 393, but based on historical context, 379 of these are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled from the P33-P44 supply chain collapse (specifically P2, P6, P25, P29, P30, P31). Only the 14 units ordered in P44 are potentially viable, though they are now 5 periods old (L=5). Since the game ends next period (P50), any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in P50 if the lead time is 1 period (L=1). Recent successful arrivals in P45 (ordered P42, P43) showed lead times of 2 and 3. Given the ending stock should be minimized and we have 0 on-hand, and the likelihood of a 1-period delivery is low but possible, I will set parameters to cover the final period's demand while acknowledging the nearly empty effective pipeline. I use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent 5-period average (100) and a lead time of 1 to attempt a final catch-up for Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: No arrivals for 3 periods following the brief resumption in P45. Effective pipeline is near zero as 379 units are confirmed legacy losses and P44 (14 units) is now 5 periods overdue.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 50, we face a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand and an unreconciled pipeline. Historically, 379 units in the 'In-transit' total (out of 393) are confirmed legacy losses from several failed delivery windows (P2, P6, P25, P29, P30, P31). The order of 14 units from P44 is now 6 periods overdue, making the effective pipeline zero. Following the brief supply chain resumption in P45 (where P42/P43 orders arrived with LT=2-3), there have been no arrivals for 4 consecutive periods. Demand has returned to a high-regime state, with the last 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 109.6 units/period. To mitigate the stockout while acknowledging the supply instability, I am setting L to 3 (recent conservative baseline) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current 110-unit demand level. The OR backend will see an effective pipeline of 0 (after my drift adjustments) and order to reach the base stock level, effectively attempting to restart the flow.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains highly unstable: after a brief resumption in P45, no arrivals occurred for P46-P49. Effective pipeline is 0 units, as 379 units are legacy losses and the P44 order (14 units) is now 6 periods overdue. Demand regime (P45-P49) is established at ~110 units/period.
