Currently, there are 300 units in-transit (ordered P1, arriving P3).

Historically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P30, and P33 (totaling 1100 units) have been lost. Currently, only orders placed within the last 5-6 periods should be considered part of the active, reliable pipeline. The 'In-transit' figure is inflated by these lost shipments. As of P44, the true active pipeline consists of orders from P40 (arrived), P42 (in-transit), and P43 (in-transit), totaling 300 units pending arrival. With On-hand inventory at 46 and demand at ~105, we face a stockout risk. To cover demand for the next 4 periods (Period 44 to Period 47, accounting for L=3 plus current), we need approx 420 units. Total active inventory (46 on-hand + 300 reliable in-transit) is 346.

The supply chain remains highly volatile with a lead time ranging from 1 to 3 periods and a significant loss rate (approx. 30-40%). Reviewing the 'In-transit' pipeline: orders from P15, P17, P18, P29, P30, and P33 (totaling 950 units) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and historical arrival patterns. Excluding these, the active pipeline consists of orders from P37 (likely also lost as it is 8 periods old), P40 (arrived P43), P42 (400% of lead time limit - likely lost), P43 (due P44-P46), P44 (due P45-P47), and the new P45 order. To recover from the stockout and maintain service levels for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) given the 33% historical loss rate, I observe that on-hand is 0 and only the P43, P44, and potential P45 orders are realistically reliable. Estimated demand for the rest of the game is 600 units (6 periods * 100). Subtracting the 300 units from P43 and P44 (assuming 100% arrival, which is risky), I need to cover 300 more units plus safety stock for the high loss rate.

Based on the confirmed 1-3 period lead time, the P45 order (placed P45, L=3 max) should arrive during Period 48 or 49. Since it did not arrive in P48, it is expected in P49. P46 and P47 orders are also within the 1-3 period window. Because Period 50 is the final period, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in Period 50 if the lead time is 1 period (observed frequently in history, e.g., P39, P38, P36).
