Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or lead-time data visible yet, however, we have 5 pre-game demand samples for 'chips(Regular)'. The average of these samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) is 114.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since inventory starts at 0, an order is required immediately to cover the pipeline demand (L+1 periods). I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline based on the provided sample distribution. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time plus arrival period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. Looking at 'Period 1 conclude', demand was 46 units, but since on-hand inventory was 0, those were lost (sold=0). This result is expected as the first order arrives later. For the parameters, I'll use 'default' for lead time (2 periods). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 using the provided historical samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) and the actual Period 1 demand (46). The mean of these 6 points is ~103. The backend will calculate (1+L) * mean, which effectively covers the inventory needs for the next 3 periods (L+1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (155 units) are currently in-transit. Following the defined sequence, the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 and 2. The mean demand over the first 5 historical samples provided in the prompt is 114.6, but the most recent realized demand in Periods 1 and 2 was 46 and 131 respectively. Given 'chips(Regular)' and no specific calendar dates, I will use all available historical samples (N=5 from prompt + 2 from game history) to estimate demand. Since the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 as (1+L) \xd7 mean, and we need to cover the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 3), I will use the default method which incorporates all available data points to stabilize the forecast against the initial stockout phase.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (141 units), Period 2 (155 units), and Period 3 (112 units). According to the lead time definition (L=2), the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or there is a persistent delay. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales for three consecutive periods. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this observed delay. Demand samples (46, 131, 87) average approximately 88 units. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture the global mean and variance until a clearer demand regime or stable arrival pattern established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2347.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (141 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 3's order (112 units) also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order (155 units) has not yet arrived (it is now late if the lead time were 1 or 2). Currently, 123 units are on-hand, and 261 units are in transit (Period 2's 155 units + Period 4's 106 units). Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded samples of 131, 92, 118, 125, and 106 (mean ~114). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have varied (3 and 1). Given the variability in lead time and the missing Period 2 order, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to let the backend average observed performance. For demand forecasting, I will use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current mean and standard deviation, which provides a robust baseline for the OR backend to set the base stock level.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 46 (P1), 131 (P2), 87 (P3), 130 (P4), and 105 (P5), with a mean of approximately 100. Previous 'conclude' messages show high lead-time volatility: the P1 order arrived after 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived after only 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (18 units) and there are 394 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Since the average demand is stable around 100-110 units and there's no clear seasonal shift yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent mean of ~114 (excluding the P1 outlier). I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed actual lead times (3 and 1), which currently averages to the promised 2.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 498 units in transit. Historical demand averages approximately 113 units per period. In Period 6, demand spiked to 171, resulting in a stockout. Regarding lead times: ordered items from P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and items from P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The shipments from Period 2 (155 units), Period 4 (106 units), and Period 5 (133 units) are currently in transit. The oldest missing shipment is from Period 2; if the lead time were strictly 3, it should have arrived in Period 5. Its absence suggests either higher lead time variability or a lost shipment. Given the stockout and lead time uncertainty, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed maximum delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent demand trend including the P6 spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods shows values of 46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, and 93. Excluding Period 1 (which seems like an initialization anomaly) and Period 6 (which spiked to 171), demand averages around 109 units per period. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are 3, 1, and 3. This indicates high volatility in delivery (avg observed lead time is 2.33). Shipments from Period 2 (155 units), Period 5 (133 units), and Period 6 (104 units) are currently in-transit (total 392 + current P7 order = 498). On-hand inventory is very low (13 units). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time. Mu_hat will use the last 6 periods of demand (excluding the P1 outlier) to better capture the recent average demand of approx 119. Sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to capture the significant variance seen in Periods 2 and 6.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is volatile, averaging 2.33 periods with observations of 1 and 3 periods. Demand shows high variance (Range 87-171).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 167 with 329 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.33). Specifically, orders from P1, P4, and P5 took 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P7 arrived in 1 period. Demand has been relatively stable but volatile, with a recent 5-period average of 116.8 (Periods 4-8). Given the lead time variability (L=3 occurs frequently), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~117 * (1+L)), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility in this SKU. This approach ensures we maintain enough base stock to buffer against both 3-period lead times and demand spikes without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1763.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a highly variable lead-time pattern. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have been 1 period (P3, P7, P8 orders) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). The average observed lead time across the 6 completed orders is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0 periods, which matches the promised average but exhibits significant jitter. Demand has been relatively stable but fluctuating around a mean of 105.3 units (last 9 periods range: 46-171, with the 46 being an early outlier). Current inventory is 137 on-hand with 345 in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P9). Specifically, the P2 order (placed 8 periods ago) and P6 order (placed 4 periods ago) are significantly overdue, suggesting they may be lost shipments. To prevent stockouts from these potentially lost units, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time, and use a 'recent_N' of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean (~110) while maintaining the 'default' sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in the full history.

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipments: Orders from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (104 units) have not arrived after 8 and 4 periods respectively, despite a max observed lead time of 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1803.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 40 units on-hand and 383 units in-transit. Historical performance shows a highly volatile lead time, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 periods). Crucially, orders from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (104 units) are now 9 and 5 periods overdue, respectively; given the maximum observed lead time is 3, these shipments are likely lost. The current in-transit (383) includes these lost units, so the effective pipeline is only 124 units (Period 9: 86, Period 10: 38). Demand has been relatively stable recently, with a 10-period mean of approximately 104.5 units per period. To account for the risk of lost shipments and the 2.2-period average lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture current demand levels while smoothing out the Period 6 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (104 units) are confirmed lost (exceeded max lead time by >2x). Inventory calculations should subtract 259 units from the reported 'In-transit' figure.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, we are in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. Total 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 489 units; however, as previously identified in Carry-over Insights, 259 units (155 from P2 and 104 from P6) are lost. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore (489 - 259) = 230 units. The orders remaining in the valid pipeline are from P9 (86 units), P10 (38 units), and P11 (106 units). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33). Historical demand samples show a range of 81-171, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 91.2 units per period. I am setting L=2 (promised) to let the OR compute based on standard cycle, but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly lower average demand observed recently while allowing for volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand regime and the need to restock quickly.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 31 units. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (104 units) are confirmed lost, as they are now 11 and 7 periods past their order dates respectively (max observed lead time is 3). The current reported 'In-transit' of 365 units includes these lost 259 units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 106 units (the Period 11 order). This explains the stockout in Period 11. To prevent further stockouts, I am using an explicit lead time L=3 (the observed maximum) and mu_hat based on the last 12 samples (mean ~102) to cover the next 4 periods (L+1). The service level remains high (approx. 95% due to high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), and providing the OR backend with explicit high-end estimates for L and mu_hat will trigger necessary restocking despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 104 units over the first 13 periods and no clear seasonal shift detected in the 'Period_X' labeling. The primary challenge is supply reliability. From the Carry-over Insights and Game History, orders from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (104 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 259 phantom units in the 'In-transit' count of 480. Therefore, the actual pipeline inventory is only 221 units (P11=106, P13=115). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has stabilized to an average of 2.11 periods (calculated from observed arrivals: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2), making (L+1) = 3.11. To ensure we don't stock out while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% service level), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (averaging ~100 units) to capture current demand levels, and utilizing 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed average. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to capture current volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the last 14 periods shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 30.1. Current ending inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is reported as 374, but 259 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving useable pipeline inventory at 115 units (ordered P13). Lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.25 periods for delivered orders. To protect against stockouts given current 0 on-hand inventory and the variable lead time, I will set L to recent observed max (3). mu_hat is calculated as (1+L)*mean of all samples (4 * 111.4 = 445.6) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std (2 * 30.1 = 60.2). This setup helps the OR backend target a base stock level that accounts for both the demand mean and historical volatility while acknowledging the effective 2-3 period lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Reported In-transit is 535 units, but based on carry-over insights, 259 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective In-transit (pipeline) is 276 units (115 from P13 and 161 from P15). Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 106 units per period. The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.33. I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) to be conservative given the recent stockouts. I will use the recent 10 periods for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture current trends while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly from the recent 10 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, accounting for the lost shipments that the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2185.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' balance of 420 units, but 259 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The adjusted pipeline inventory is actually 161 units (the order from Period 15). Demand has surged in Period 16 to 164 units, bringing the 5-period average to approximately 120 units. The observed lead times are highly variable, often hitting 3 periods. To account for this, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. mu_hat is set to 480 (4 periods * 120 avg demand) to rebuild stock after several stockouts and meet the recent higher demand. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the high historical variance (81-171 demand range) and prevent stockouts during the long lead time.

Carry-over insight: Adjusted inventory audit: 259 units in 'In-transit' (P2, P6) are non-recoverable losses. Demand is trending upward with the most recent sample at 164 (+36% over avg).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18. Recent demand has surged significantly (P16: 164, P17: 194), indicating a new demand regime or seasonal peak. The previous 5-period average (P13-P17) is approximately 142.6, compared to the earlier historical average of ~100. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. Crucially, 259 units in 'In-transit' (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the pipeline inventory. Total reported In-transit is 562; adjusting for losses (562 - 259) leaves 303 effective units in-transit. With on-hand inventory at 0 and rising demand, we must set parameters to ensure higher coverage. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand shift for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and maintain an explicit lead time of 3 to buffer against the maximum observed delay, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for the current 194-unit peak and the inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Avg demand increased from ~100 to ~179 in last 2 periods (+79%). Current adjusted In-transit is 303 (Reported 562 - 259 lost units from P2/P6).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is 180 units (164, 194, 182), which is significantly higher than the earlier average of approximately 104. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts since Period 15 because arrivals have not kept pace with this demand shift. Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 688 contains 259 units (from P2 and P6) that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 429 units. The lead time remains volatile, with arrivals taking either 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.33). To maximize reward and prevent further stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using an explicit forecast of 180 units per period (180 * 3.33 = 600). I am setting L to 2.33 to reflect the observed average lead time, and sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high demand variance and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher levels (avg ~180) for 3 consecutive periods (P16-P18). Service level is currently 0% over last 4 periods due to combined effect of lost shipments (259 units) and demand surge.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that stabilized starting at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 185 units over the last 4 periods (164, 194, 182, 199). On-hand inventory is 0 due to 259 units of lost shipments (P2 and P6) and this recent demand surge. The reported 'In-transit' of 732 units must be adjusted by subtracting the 259 lost units, resulting in an effective pipeline of 473 units (P15, P17, P18, P19 orders). Total inventory (on-hand 0 + effective in-transit 473) is likely insufficient to meet the next 3 periods (L=2) of demand (~555 units). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand mean (~185 * 3 = 555) and set L to calculate to account for the actual lead-time volatility (averaging ~2.2-2.3, which effectively rounds up to 3 in many cases). This will prompt the backend to place an order to bridge the gap and restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~185 units/period over P16-P19 (+85% from early game avg). Effective in-transit is 473 units (Reported 732 - 259 lost).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from a historical average of ~100 to an average of 186.4 over the last 5 periods (164, 194, 182, 199, 193). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the service level has been poor due to stockouts and lost shipments. Total reported 'In-transit' is 732, but Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P2 (155) and P6 (104) are lost, totaling 259 non-recoverable units. Thus, effective in-transit is 473 units. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.33; I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to capture this volatility. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime (avg ~186), which translates to a mu_hat of ~615 for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=5 to account for the increased variance in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: P16-P20 average demand is 186.4 (+86% over P1-P15 average). Effective In-transit is significantly lower than reported due to confirmed losses of P2 and P6 shipments (259 units total).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime starting from Period 16, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) being 192.3 units, compared to the early-game average of ~100. The most recent demand (P21) hit 222 units. Lead times remain volatile (ranging 1-3 periods), so an explicit L of 3 is used to ensure coverage for the maximum observed delay. Inventory is currently critical (on-hand 0). The reported 'In-transit' of 732 units includes 259 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective In-transit is 473 units (732 - 259). This pipeline includes orders from P15 (161), P17 (142), P18 (126), and P19 (44). Given the demand surge and a 0% service level over the last 5 periods, mu_hat is set using an explicit value of 770 units ((1+3) periods * ~192.5 units/period) to force the OR engine to reconcile the gap between the effective pipeline and the new demand level, accounting for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg increased from 104 to 192 (+85%) sustained over 6 periods. Effective in-transit is 473 (Reported 732 - 259 lost units from P2/P6).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime starting from Period 16. Using a recent_N window of 7 periods (P16-P22) yields an average demand of 188.1 units. The service level has been 0% for several periods due to inventory exhaustion and lost shipments. The reported 'In-transit' of 834 units includes 259 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 575 units (834 - 259). Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to use the historical average (approx 2.3). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are recovering from a stockout, mu_hat is set to reflect the current high-demand regime (188.1 * (1+L)) and sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of this same window to ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order to cover the increased demand and restore buffers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P22): Average demand is 188.1 units, representing an 81% increase over the early game average (~104). Service level remains critical (0% in recent periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is firmly established. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 23 is approximately 195.5 units (164, 194, 182, 199, 193, 222, 163, 247). This is an 88% increase over the early game average (~104). Service levels remain extremely poor (0% for several periods) due to this surge and the lost shipments from P2 and P6 (259 units). The reported in-transit is 732, but subtracting the 259 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 473. The arrival of the Period 22 order (102 units) with lead_time=1 confirms that the logistics channel is still functioning, albeit sporadically. I will set mu_hat using recent_N for the last 8 periods (the new regime) and use an explicit L of 2 to maintain a high base stock, ensuring the OR engine triggers an order to replenish the depleted on-hand inventory while accounting for the high demand volatility observed during this peak (sigma_hat recent_N=8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P23) at 195.5 units/period (+88% over early game). Effective In-transit remains 259 units lower than reported due to confirmed losses of P2 and P6 shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~104 to ~192 (+85%). The latest demand sample (P24) remains strong at 166, with a recent average (P16-P24) of ~193.3 units. We are currently experiencing an inventory crisis with 0 on-hand inventory and a 0% service level over the last 8 periods. Critical inventory audit: The 'In-transit' figure of 732 units includes 259 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost shipments. The effective pipeline is therefore 473 units (732 - 259). To recover service levels and account for the higher demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the shift from P16 onwards) to capture the ~193 units/period average. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3, reflecting the conservative edge of observed lead times (range 1-3) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock covering (3+1)=4 periods of demand (~772 units). This will help bridge the gap between the effective pipeline (473) and the required inventory to resume sales.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established over 10 periods (P16-P25), with an average demand of 197.4 units/period. This is a nearly 100% increase over the early-game average (~100). The current service level is critical (0% sales in P24-P25) due to stockouts and the carry-over effect of 259 lost units from Periods 2 and 6. At Period 26, the reported 'In-transit' of 862 units is artificially inflated; subtracting the 259 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 603 units. To recover, mu_hat must reflect this higher demand (approx 200/period) across the lead time + review period. I am setting L=3 (explicit) because, while the backend promised 2, the average observed lead time is ~2.3 with several 3-period instances, and we need to buffer for the current supply instability. mu_hat is set to 800 (calculated as (1+L)*200 = 4*200) to ensure the target base stock covers the demand surge. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in the new regime (Std dev ~27, adjusted for lead time).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P25) at 197.4 units/period (~100% increase over early game). Effective In-transit is 603 units (Reported 862 - 259 lost from P2/P6).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~104 to ~185 units. However, Period 26 saw a significant drop to 110 units, which may indicate the end of that peak or just high variance. I will use recent_N=11 to capture the high-demand regime while including the transition. Inventory remains critical with on-hand at 0. A major challenge is the 'In-transit' figure: 259 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and never arrived despite the promised L=2 and maximum observed L=3. The reported In-transit of 891 includes these phantom units, so effective pipeline is 632. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (roughly 2.3) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the current demand level. The \u03c3\u0302 is set to 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility seen since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 26 dropped to 110 after 10 periods averaging ~195 units. Inventory deficit is severe due to 259 lost units in pipeline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the system reports 891 units in-transit. However, based on the historical logs and past carry-over insights, 259 units (from Period 2: 155, and Period 6: 104) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have exceeded the maximum observed (3 periods) by more than 7x. This results in an effective pipeline inventory of 632 units. Demand has entered a high-volume, high-variance regime since Period 16. While the average during P16-P25 was ~195 units, the last two periods (P26, P27) saw a cooldown to 110 and 125 respectively. Given the 19/1 critical ratio (Profit $19, Holding $1), we must maintain high service levels. I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (encompassing the high-demand regime) to capture the trend while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period observed lead times, ensuring the OR engine calculates requirements for a 4-period window (P + L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift cooldown: Demand averaged ~197 (P16-P25) but dropped to an average of 117.5 in the last 2 periods (P26-P27), indicating possible stabilization at a lower but still elevated level compared to early game (avg ~104).

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a cooling trend over the last three periods (P26: 110, P27: 125, P28: 83), with an average of 106 units per period, returning closer to early-game levels after a sustained high-demand regime (P16-P25 avg: 197). On-hand inventory is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' is 862 units. However, consistent with previous audits, 259 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, and the P15 (161 units), P17 (142), P18 (126), and P19 (44) orders are now significantly overdue (10+ periods), suggesting they are also likely lost. Total effective pipeline is much lower than reported. To avoid over-ordering given the recent demand drop while acknowledging pipeline uncertainty, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the cooling trend. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile observed history (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly between P26-P28, averaging 106 units compared to the P16-P25 average of 197. Shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P19 are now highly suspect/lost due to exceeding 3x the max observed lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain disruption and a shifting demand profile. We have 862 units reported as 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms significant losses: Period 2 (155) and Period 6 (104) are definitely lost (259 units). Furthermore, shipments from P15 (161), P17 (142), P18 (126), and P19 (44) are now excessively overdue (10+ periods against a max observed lead time of 3), totaling 473 additional likely lost units. Combined, 732 units of the 862 reported in-transit are likely non-recoverable, leaving an effective pipeline of only 130 units (from P25). Demand has cooled from its P16-P25 peak (avg ~197) to an average of 97.25 over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this cooldown and using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful deliveries. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to maintain a buffer for the high volatility observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Collapse: Out of 862 in-transit units, approximately 732 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed or highly likely lost. Effective pipeline is only 130 units. Demand has reverted to a lower regime, averaging 97.25 units over P26-P29.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 31. Demand Analysis: The high-demand regime (avg ~197) observed from P16-P25 has ended. Demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has cooled significantly, averaging 95.4 units (samples: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88), which is closer to the early game average (approx 104). Pipeline Analysis: The situation is critical. The system reports 862 units in transit, but historical evidence suggests severe losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (155), P6 (104), P15 (161), P17 (142), P18 (126), and P19 (44) are now excessively overdue (promised LT=2, max observed=3, current delay 11+ periods). This totals 732 lost units. The 'effective' in-transit is only ~130 units (from P25). Strategy: We must use the 'explicit' method for L to signal the risk and effectively reset the base stock calculation, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime. Because the backend subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and the backend thinks pipeline is 862 (while effective is ~130), we must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap or force an order to overcome the ghost inventory, or use explicit values if necessary. However, since the OR backend logic is fixed, and it sees 862 units in transit, it will subtract 862. If our calculated base_stock (\u03bc + z\u03c3) is less than 862, it will order 0. Given the demand is ~95, a base stock for 3 periods (L=2) is around 300-400. To force order, we need to account for the 732 'ghost' units. Setting mu_hat to an explicit high value (current target + ghost units) to ensure the backend actually places an order.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Collapse confirmed at Period 30: 732 units in-transit are lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Current effective pipeline is only 130 units (ordered P25). Demand has reverted to ~95 units/period (P26-P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following a period of extreme volatility and high demand. Over the last six periods (P26-P31), the average demand is 88.3 units, significantly lower than the P16-P25 average of ~197 units. We will set mu_hat based on the last 6 samples (N=6) to reflect this shift. The inventory situation is critical due to massive pipeline losses. As documented in previous Carry-over Insights and confirmed by Period 31, approximately 732 units from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are lost. This leaves an effective in-transit of 355 units (the 130 ordered in P25 and the 225 ordered in P31) against a reported 1087. By using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and reflecting the current stabilized demand of ~88/period, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that attempts to cover the deficit. We maintain L=default (2) as recent arrivals (P26, P22) have shown lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P26-P31 average is 88.3 units/period (-55% from peak regime). Total confirmed lost inventory (in-transit) is 732 units.

The pipeline is severely compromised; historical analysis confirms that 732 units reported in 'In-transit' from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 are lost, as they have exceeded any reasonable lead time (some by over 20 periods). The effective 'In-transit' is 130 units (from Period 25), while the remaining 732 units in the reported inventory of 862 are non-recoverable. With 123 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 130 units, the current total inventory is 253 units. Given the new demand regime (approx. 90/period) and a lead time of 2-3 periods, the OR backend requires parameters that reflect this stabilization. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current lower demand level, and L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 862 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence and 'Period X conclude' messages indicate a massive pipeline collapse. Specifically, orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 732 units) are logically lost as they are now 15-32 periods past their order date, far exceeding the max observed lead time of 3. Only 130 units (ordered Period 25) are potentially viable, though even these are now 9 periods old. Demand has clearly shifted from a high regime (~197/period) back to a lower regime. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), mean demand is 91.5 units, which is much closer to the early game average (~104). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current unreliability of arrivals and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. By setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean effectively covers the next 4 periods of demand, while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering if the pipe suddenly clears.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Collapse Finalized: 732 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Effective 'In-transit' is 130 units (from P25), though these are also overdue. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~92 units/period since Period 26.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following a period of extreme volatility and a previous high-demand surge. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), average demand is approximately 93.1 units. The pipeline is heavily compromised: out of the reported 862 units 'In-transit', 732 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed lost, and the 130 units from Period 25 are now 10 periods overdue (promised lead time 2, max observed 3), making them highly likely lost as well. This leaves an effective pipeline of 0 units. Demand in P34 was 96 units, and on-hand is currently 0. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the recent 9-period average of ~93 units to stabilize inventory. I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the upper end of successful lead times observed, providing a safety buffer while internalizing that the 'In-transit' figure on the backend is inaccurate due to losses.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline fully collapsed: 862 units reported in-transit are likely 100% lost (732 confirmed, 130 from P25 now 3x past max observed lead time). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime stabilized at ~93 units/period (P26-P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 862 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these are almost certainly lost. This includes 732 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (confirmed lost/extremely overdue) and 130 units from Period 25 (over 10 periods past promised lead time). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is treated as 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged 97.1 units. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while excluding the previous surge. Setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to bypass the 'calculate' logic that might be skewed by the lost shipments, ensuring the OR backend focuses on restoring stock for the current (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline audit at Period 36: All 862 units reported 'In-transit' are considered lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Effective pipeline is 0. Recent demand regime (P26-P35) average is 97.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the 'In-transit' figure of 862 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P25). The effective pipeline is zero, and on-hand inventory is zero. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the Period 16-25 spike. Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the average demand is 97.7 units per period. The recent three periods (P34-P36) have shown slightly higher figures (96, 135, 112), bringing the recent average to ~114 units. To recover from the stockout caused by the pipeline collapse and recent demand volatility, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized lower-demand regime while including the recent slight uptick. Standard deviation (sigma_hat) will also be calculated over this 11-period window to capture current volatility. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average (approx 2.3 periods), which helps the OR engine account for the reality of 3-period arrivals despite the nominal 2-period promise. Explicit parameter override is necessary because the OR backend's default logic cannot 'see' that the 862 units in-transit are lost, and would otherwise prevent new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed that all 862 units in-transit are lost. Sustained demand regime (P26-P36) is ~98 units/period, with a slight upward trend in the last 3 periods to ~114 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 862 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms a total pipeline collapse for these specific orders. No units from Period 2 (155), Period 6 (104), Period 15 (161), Period 17 (142), Period 18 (126), Period 19 (44), or Period 25 (130) have arrived, with lead times now exceeding 12-35 periods. The effective pipeline is 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 37 is 98.6 units. In the last three periods (P35-P37), demand served as 135, 112, and 100 (average 115.6), suggesting a slight upward drift or return to early-game levels (~104). I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (P26-P37) to capture this stable regime, and use 'explicit' for L to force the OR backend to ignore the zombie pipeline units by setting L to a high enough value or managing the base stock. However, since the OR engine subtracts 'in-transit' from 'base_stock', and our actual 'in-transit' is 0 while the OR engine sees 862, we must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value high enough to trigger an order despite the 862 phantom units. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean + z*sigma. Lead time L=2. Target ~ (3 * 105) + 60 = 375. To get an order when the engine thinks we have 862, we must set mu_hat exceptionally high to overcome the 862 subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Effective pipeline is confirmed 0 units despite 862 units reported 'In-transit'. To bypass the OR engine's subtraction of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 862).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1315 units in-transit. Based on historical data and the pattern of non-arrival, 862 units from orders placed in Period 2 to Period 25 are confirmed lost. The remaining in-transit units consist of the Period 38 order (453 units). Effective pipeline inventory is therefore 453. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has stabilized at a higher regime (averaging ~119 units over P35-P38), we need to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the next 3 periods of demand (L+1). However, the OR engine subtracts all 1315 in-transit units from its target. To force an order, we must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 1315 > 0'. My target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (3 periods * 120 demand) + safety stock \u2248 450 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1765 (1315 + 450) to offset the 862 lost units effectively and aim for a net replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Pipeline audit confirms that reported In-transit (1315) contains 862 units of lost inventory from P2-P25. Effective pipeline is only 453 units (from P38). Recent demand (P35-P38) has trended upwards to an average of 119.25 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $887.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, On-hand inventory is 386 units after the arrival of the Period 38 order. The reported In-transit is 1,354, but we have confirmed 862 units from periods P2-P25 are permanently lost (Carry-over Period 36). Thus, the effective pipeline is 1,354 - 862 = 492 units (which is the order placed in Period 39). Demand has been volatile but shows a slight upward trend; the average of the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 108.8 units. To maintain availability while accounting for the OR engine's tendency to subtract the 'phantom' 862 units of lost inventory from the base stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. Target Base Stock = (1+L) * mu + Safety Stock + Lost Pipeline Correction. With L=2 (promised) and mu=110, Base Stock would be ~330 plus safety stock. To ensure an order is placed or current levels are maintained despite the 862 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 1,300 to clear the phantom inventory reporting and maintain a healthy steady state.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Current effective pipeline is 492 units (P39 order). The reported 1354 In-transit includes 862 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2-P25) which the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from base stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system reports 788 units on-hand and 862 units in-transit. A review of history confirms that the 862 units in-transit are all lost shipments from early periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25). My actual effective pipeline is 0. The OR engine, however, sees 862 units in-transit and will subtract them from any base stock calculation. Recent demand (P35-P40) has stabilized at an average of 105.6 units/period. To prevent the engine from ordering nothing when it subtracts the 862 phantom units, I must set mu_hat to cover both the desired base stock and the lost volume. Desired base stock for a lead time of 1-3 periods (avg 2) plus review period is (1+L)*demand. Given L=2, base stock should be ~316. To trigger a sufficient order, mu_hat must technically be (Base Stock + 862). However, with 788 currently on-hand, I am well-stocked for near-term demand. My goal is to maintain this level. mu_hat is set to an explicit value that accounts for the phantom inventory subtraction while reflecting the current demand regime (~106 avg).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Reported In-transit (862) consists entirely of lost units from P2-P25. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime (P35-P40) is stable at ~106 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~98 units/period) following the peak observed between Periods 16-25. In the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is 96 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 701 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of demand at the current rate. However, there is a significant data discrepancy problem: the system reports 862 units 'In-transit', but these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2-25 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Because the OR engine subtracts this phantom 'In-transit' quantity from the calculated base stock to determine the order size, it will effectively stop ordering until this inventory is 'cleared' or until the base stock requirement exceeds 862. Currently, my goal is to maintain a healthy stock level while accounting for this 862-unit subtraction. Since on-hand is already high (701), I do not need to order immediately. I will set parameters to reflect the current demand regime (recent 10 periods) and use L=2 to ensure the backend projects enough safety stock, but I won't use the 'explicit' mu_hat trick yet because on-hand inventory is more than enough to cover the lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized at a lower level compared to the mid-game peak, but shows higher variance recently. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 42 is approximately 102 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 547 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 862 units is confirmed to be comprised of lost shipments from Period 2 to Period 25 and should be treated as 0 for planning purposes. Because the OR backend subtracts the reported In-transit (862) from the calculated base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset this phantom inventory. A desired base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand at ~105 units/period with a safety buffer would be approximately 450 units. To bypass the subtraction of 862 units, mu_hat should ideally target (Desired Base Stock + Phantom In-transit) = 450 + 862 = 1312. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this correction is applied. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual recent performance which has fluctuated between 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed on-hand inventory is 547 units. Reported In-transit (862 units) remains 100% lost (phantom inventory). To maintain stock levels, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + 862) to counteract OR backend logic.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 35-43 has stabilized at an average of 110 units/period (P35: 135, P36: 112, P37: 100, P38: 130, P39: 67, P40: 90, P41: 87, P42: 154, P43: 116). Current on-hand inventory is 431 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. The reported 'In-transit' of 862 units is confirmed 'phantom inventory' consisting of lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 25. Because the OR backend subtracts all In-transit units from its base stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), it believes the system is overstocked by 862 units and will not place new orders despite the effective pipeline being 0. To counteract this and maintain a target base stock of approximately 330 units (3 periods of demand at 110), mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' at (Target Base Stock + 862) = 1192. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - 862) results in the desired protection level. No new order is expected to trigger immediately since on-hand (431) > target (330), but this parameter setup ensures the system remains responsive once on-hand inventory depletes further.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1249.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Status: Current on-hand is 347 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 862 units is confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 2-25) and must be treated as 0. The OR backend subtracts this 862 from the base stock calculation, so I must offset this by adding 862 to the mu_hat value. 

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P40-P44) has been 90, 87, 154, 116, 84, averaging 106.2 units/period. The regime is relatively stable around the ~100-110 mark but with high variance (sigma). 

Lead Time: Recent actual lead times (P38, P39) were 1 period, although the promised lead time is 2. I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance.

Strategy: Target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (estimated at ~110 * 3 = 330). To ensure the backend places an order or maintains stock despite the 862 phantom units, I set mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock + 862). Desired mu_hat = 330 + 862 = 1192. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory of 862 units persists in the In-transit total; mu_hat must be adjusted upward by 862 to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Recent demand regime (P40-P44) is stable at ~106 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2233.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a moderate level. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is approximately 106.9 units. The most recent sample was 129. In terms of lead time, recent successful arrivals (P38, P39) showed a lead time of 1 period. However, the system still reports 862 units of 'In-transit' inventory that were confirmed lost in earlier periods (P2-P25). These 'phantom' units are incorrectly subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend. To compensate, I set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + 862). With L=2 and a mean demand of ~107, the Target Base Stock = (1+L)*107 = 321. Adding the 862 lost units yields 1183. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility of the recent stable regime (approx. 25-30 units per period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1202.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26, currently averaging 97.4 units per period (P26-P46). Inventory management is complicated by 862 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P2-P25) that remain in the 'In-transit' figure, which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the calculated base stock. As of Period 47, reported In-transit is 1040, which includes 862 lost units and 178 active units (from P45 and P46 orders). Effective In-transit is therefore 178. On-hand inventory is 147. To maintain a target base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock (approx 400-450 units total) while bypassing the OR engine's subtraction of 862 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will target a base stock of roughly 1300 (438 actual target + 862 phantom offset). This ensures the OR engine places an order to replenish the physical stock rather than relying on lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1333.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late stage of the game (Period 48/50). The primary challenge continues to be the 862 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2-P25) appearing in the 'In-transit' total (1233 units). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation; if we don't adjust, it will skip ordering and cause a stockout. Effective pipeline is actually 371 units (1233 - 862), consisting of orders from P45 (73), P46 (105), and P47 (193). Recent demand (P45-P47) averages 91.3 units, while the broader regime since P40 is ~104 units. To maintain a target base stock that ensures availability for the final two periods while counteracting the 862-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety. With L=2, (3 * 104) = 312 units. Adding the 862 phantom units gives 1174. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure a small order is placed to top up the 73 on-hand units, as P45-P47 orders should start arriving in P48-P50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' is 1233 units. However, consistent with our historical audits, 862 units are 'phantom inventory' (lost units from Periods 2-25: 155+104+161+142+126+44+130). Subtracting these 862 units from the reported 1233 leaves an effective pipeline of 371 units (from orders in P45, P46, P47). Because these are within the 1-3 period lead time window, they are likely to arrive soon, but we are currently stocked out. The demand regime from Period 40-48 averages 102.4 units per period. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach a target base stock while being docked by 862 phantom units, we must set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + 862). With a lead time of 2 and 103 units per period, the Ideal Base Stock (1+L)*mu is ~309. Adding 862 phantom units gives 1171. To be conservative and capture the most recent variance, I will use mu_hat explicit = 1200.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final period. On-hand inventory is 0. Reported In-transit is 1279, which includes 862 units of confirmed lost 'phantom' inventory from periods 2-25. Effective In-transit is 417 units (from orders in P45-P47, P49). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~100 units/period) since Period 26. Since this is the final decision phase, and orders placed now (Lead Time >= 1) will arrive after the game ends, the goal is to set parameters that maintain information without triggering unnecessary costs, though the order will not impact the final reward. I will maintain the recent demand forecast of ~102 units and adjust for phantom inventory to reflect a zero-order intent since further arrivals are impossible within the timeframe.
