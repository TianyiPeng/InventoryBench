The demand samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) yield an average of 114.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 15.2. The OR algorithm suggests a capped order of 141 units based on the promised lead time of 2 periods. Since current on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0, we must place an order to meet future demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the cost of a stockout is significantly higher than the cost of holding inventory, favoring a slightly aggressive initial position. The OR recommendation of 141 units aligns with a strategy to build a base stock while respecting the cap intended to prevent over-ordering in the face of uncertainty.

Strategy: The goal is to cover L+1 periods (3 periods) of demand. Total demand for 3 periods (~342 units) minus pipeline (296) leaves a requirement of ~46 units. However, the OR recommendation is 112 units. OR calculates base stock using the mean (~114) and standard deviation from all samples. Given that we have had zero sales due to 0 inventory, we must ensure we replenish enough to avoid stockouts once the pipeline starts arriving.

Let's re-verify pipeline: Period 6 (125 units) is still in transit (ordered P6, currently start of P9). Period 8 (155 units) is in transit. Total reliable pipeline = 125 + 155 = 280 units. Period 2 is lost. Total units expected to cover future periods = 135 (on-hand) + 280 (pipeline) = 415 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand sequence: 46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, 93, 85. Average demand is approx 106 units/period. The current stock + reliable pipeline (415 units) covers roughly 3.9 periods of demand. 4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 units because the current on-hand (135) plus total in-transit (435, which still includes the lost 155 units) exceeds its target. However, removing the lost 155 units gives an adjusted pipeline of 280. Total available is 415. With an average lead time of approx 3 periods, we need to cover P9, P10, P11, and P12. 415 units is sufficient.

Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 190. In-transit inventory consists of P6 (125 units, 4 periods ago - likely lost or extremely delayed) and P9 (50 units, 1 period ago). \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand over the last 9 periods averages approximately 105 units/period (total 948 / 9). Recent demand (last 3 periods) is 93, 85, 100, showing relative stability. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units because the current stock (190) and pipeline (330) appear high. However, the pipeline is deceptive: P6 (125 units) is now 4 periods old; based on our lead-time pattern (max 3), it is likely lost. Treating P6 and the previously confirmed lost P2 as zero, the 'real' pipeline is only 50 units (P9). Total reliable stock = 190 (on-hand) + 50 (P9) = 240 units. This covers roughly 2.3 periods of demand (240 / 105). Given lead-time volatility up to 3 periods, we need a buffer. \n5. Decision: I will order 50 units. This keeps the replacement flow active without overstocking, as 190 on-hand is already roughly 2 periods' worth of supply.

Therefore, the reliable pipeline is 530 - 280 = 250 units (comprising orders from P15, P17, and today's P18). P15 (110 units) is expected to arrive in P18 or P19. 2. Demand Analysis: Demand has significantly increased in the last two periods (164, 194) compared to the long-term average (~110). Using a 3-period horizon (L+1), we need approximately 450-500 units to cover this higher demand regime and avoid stockouts. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 56. Reliable pipeline is 250.

However, a significant portion of the pipeline is currently categorized as 'lost'. 2. Inventory & Pipeline Analysis: Total system-reported 'In-transit' is 1130 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, we must discount lost shipments: P2 (155), P6 (125), P15 (110), P17 (140), and P18 (150), totaling 680 units. Additionally, P19 (150) is now 7 periods overdue (promised 2, max observed 3), so it is also highly likely lost. This brings total cumulative lost units to 830. The 'reliable' pipeline consists of P24 (150) and P25 (150), totaling 300 units. Current on-hand is 0. 3. Demand Analysis: The demand regime remains high. The last 10 periods average ~193 units, with the most recent Period 25 at 214 units. 4. Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 0 is heavily skewed by the 1130 'In-transit' units, most of which are ghosts. To cover demand for the lead time plus current period (L+1=3), and considering we only have 300 reliable units arriving in the pipeline, we are facing stockouts. Target stock for 3 periods at ~200 demand is 600 units. With 0 on-hand and 300 reliable units incoming, we need significantly more inventory.
