Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) gives a mean of 114.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 15.3. For the decision phase of Period 1, we must account for the current period's demand plus the lead time (L=2), meaning the base stock must cover 3 periods (1+L) of demand. Since there are no in-transit units and 0 on-hand inventory, an order is necessary to avoid stockouts as soon as the lead time elapses. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the length of the provided sample history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory and placed an order for 141 units. Demand in Period 1 was 86 units, which went unsatisfied (sold=0) because the order placed in Period 1's decision phase only arrives in Period 3 (given the promised lead time of 2). Period 1's conclude message shows 'arrived=0', which is expected for L=2. Historical demand data (P1-P5) provided in the prompt shows an average of ~114.6 units per period. Period 1 actual demand was 86, slightly below that average. Since we only have 1 period of game history and 5 periods of 'pre-game' historical samples, I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available data (historical samples + Period 1) to estimate mean and variance. This provides a stable baseline as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (141 units) and P2 (140 units), totaling 281 units in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. The historical demand for this SKU (P1-P5) averages 114.6 units per period. Since we have no confirmed arrival data yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise, I will use the default lead time (L=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 5 available historical data points (the 'default' method) to establish a baseline forecast, as there isn't enough game history to detect a regime shift from the provided samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in Period 3's 'conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and all units sold are 0 because on-hand remained at 0. This suggests a potential delay in the actual lead time (it is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is lost). Currently, there is 367 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first 3 periods was 86, 132, and 100 (avg ~106). Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 sales so far due to stockouts, we must ensure the OR backend continues to place orders to cover demand. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent demand level (avg 106).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 141 units did not arrive by end of Period 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of previous orders. From 'Period 4 conclude', the Period 1 order arrived with an actual lead time of 3 periods (X-Z = 4-1 = 3), while the Period 3 order arrived shockingly early with a lead time of 1 (4-3 = 1). The Period 2 order (140 units) is still in transit and is now at L=3 relative to its placement, echoing the delay seen in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [131, 92, 118, 125, 106] (Note: the 'conclude' messages show demand values 86, 132, 100, 75 but the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided 131, 92, 118, 125, 106; I will prioritize the provided data block for statistical calculations). The mean is 114.4 and std is approx 15.6. Although the promised lead time is 2, the evidence of L=3 for the first large order suggests we should prepare for a lead time of 3 to avoid stockouts. I will set L to 3 and use recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: Observed L=3 (P1 order) and L=1 (P3 order). Recommend planning for L=3 to mitigate stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the lead-time and demand patterns. We have seen significant volatility in lead times: the Period 1 order took 3 periods (L=3), while the Period 3 order arrived in just 1 period (L=1). The Period 2 order (140 units) and Period 4 order (97 units) are still in transit. Given the high stockout penalty (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must protect against the longer observed lead time of 3 periods. Historical demand (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) averages 114.4 units. Since demand is relatively stable across all 5 samples, I will use 'default' (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For lead time, I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand, accounting for the demonstrated risk of delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 416 units in-transit. In Period 6, we stocked out (sold 46 out of 77 demanded). History shows highly volatile lead times: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, but P2 (ordered 140 units) and P4 (ordered 97 units) are still missing. P2 is now 4 periods late (beyond the observed max of 3), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. To protect against this uncertainty and the stockout observed in P6, I am setting L=3 (explicitly) to calculate the pipeline requirement over a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (P2-P6: 132, 100, 75, 106, 77) average 98. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the current demand regime. By setting L to 3, the backend will target a base stock level that covers (1+3)=4 periods of demand (~392 units), which helps ensure we order enough to recover from the stockout and the potentially lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 6 stockout confirmed (demand 77, sold 46). Period 7 potential lost shipment: Order from P2 (140 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (promised 2, max observed 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a complex supply situation for chips(Regular). The on-hand inventory is 30 units, and we have 335 units in-transit. A critical issue is the order from Period 2 (140 units), which is now 6 periods since ordering and has not arrived, despite the longest observed lead time being 3 periods. This shipment is likely lost. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. However, given the lost shipment and previous stockout in Period 6, I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the safety stock covers the high uncertainty in arrival. Demand has been relatively stable with a 7-period average of 91.8; using a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat will capture this average, while default sigma_hat will account for the historical volatility. This conservative approach aims to rebuild inventory buffers to prevent further stockouts despite the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 2 (140 units) is presumed lost after 5 periods of delay (max observed lead time was 3 periods). Supply chain remains highly unreliable; base stock planning should assume L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The inventory is at 0 due to a stockout in Period 8 (demand 127 vs 93 units available). The shipment from Period 2 (140 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost. Recent observed lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 period (P3, P7) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). Given the unreliability and the lost P2 shipment, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to safeguard against stockouts during longer delivery legs. Demand remains relatively stable with an 8-period mean of ~96 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand volatility (std ~25-30) while forecasting for the (L+1)=4 period window. Pipeline inventory currently shows 313 units (from P6, P8, P9), but excluding the lost P2 order is essential for the OR backend's logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P2 shipment (140 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, max L=3). Stockout occurred in P8 despite arrivals due to high demand (127) and unreliable supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme lead-time volatility (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and confirmed shipment loss (Period 2 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after consecutive stockouts in Period 8 and 9. Demand is averaging approximately 98 units per period (last 9 periods). To prevent further stockouts given the unreliable lead times and the current 0 on-hand balance, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed delay) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough units for the lead time plus the review period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture recent demand levels (~100/period) and for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (364 units) is high, so the OR backend should moderate new orders while still targetting a safe inventory level for a 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 5: 97.4), but inventory remains at zero due to 1-period vs 3-period lead time flips and a lost P2 order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 11. Demand is stable, averaging 97 over the last 5 periods (97.4) and 98 over the last 10. However, supply chain reliability is poor. We have confirmed a lost shipment from Period 2 (140 units) and volatile lead times. Observed lead times have been 1 period (P3, P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). Order from Period 6 (132 units) is now at lead time 4 and is likely lost or significantly delayed, similar to the P2 order. Order from Period 9 (92 units) is at lead time 2. With on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple stockouts, we must assume a lead time of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the frequent '3-period' delivery mode. I will use L=3 and set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (approx 97 units/period * (1+3) = 388). Setting sigma_hat to the standard deviation of the last 10 periods scaled for L=3 provides the necessary safety stock (approx sqrt(4)*22.4 = 44.8).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Order from Period 6 (132 units) is presumed lost or severely delayed (5 periods elapsed, max successful L=3). Supply chain continues to oscillate between L=1 and L=3 with frequent losses.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable, oscillating between L=1 and L=3 with frequent lost shipments (P2 and P6 orders are confirmed lost after 10 and 6 periods respectively). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system has suffered continuous stockouts. Demand is relatively stable, with an average of approximately 106 units over the last 5 periods (P7-P11: 67, 127, 110, 108, 125). To recover from the current stockout and account for the high lead-time volatility (max L=3), I am setting L=3. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand, using the mean of the last 5 periods (107.4 * 4 = 429.6). sigma_hat is calculated for 4 periods using the standard deviation of the last 5 periods (std \u2248 23.4, sqrt(4)*23.4 \u2248 46.8). This aggressive safety stock is necessary to buffer against the demonstrated risk of lost shipments and lead time delays.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw arrivals from Period 9 (L=3) and Period 10 (L=2), bringing on-hand inventory to 28 units. However, the order from Period 6 (132 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is definitely lost. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 120.4 units, which is a significant increase from the previous mean of ~97. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime. Given the extreme lead time volatility (observed L values of 1, 2, and 3) and frequent lost shipments (P2 and P6), I will continue to use an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock level to cover the maximum observed lead time plus the one-period review cycle (L+1=4 periods of demand). This conservative approach is necessary to mitigate the high risk of stockouts caused by supply chain unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg increased to ~120 units (last 5 periods) from ~97. Order from Period 6 (132 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) continues to be highly unreliable, with actual lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and multiple orders (Period 2 and Period 6) lost. In Period 13, on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending on-hand: 0), and demand remains elevated compared to the early periods (mean of last 5 periods ~117.4). Currently, there are 449 units in-transit (from Periods 11, 12, and 13). Specifically, the order from P11 (0 units) is irrelevant, but P12 (38 units) and P13 (139 units) are pending. Given the L=3 history, I will continue to set L to an explicit value of 3 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the frequent 3-period delays and lost shipments. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (covering periods 9-13) to capture the sustained higher demand regime of ~120 units. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly volatile and unreliable. After a period of stockouts (Periods 13 and 14), we are entering Period 15 with zero on-hand inventory. The lead time oscillates significantly between 1 and 3 periods, with several shipments (Period 2 and Period 6) definitively lost. Historically, observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2. While the mean lead time is ~2.1, the frequent 3-period arrivals and missing shipments necessitate planning for a lead time (L) of 3 to provide a safety buffer against stockouts. Demand has shifted slightly upwards. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 115 units, compared to the earlier average of ~97. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the backend calculates a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set to 460 (115 * 4 periods) using the explicit method to account for the recent demand increase and lead time risk. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Supply chain remains high-risk with frequent 3-period lead times and lost shipments (P2 and P6). Demand stable at new mean of ~115 (Periods 10-14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly volatile and unreliable, characterized by lead times oscillating between 1 and 3 periods and confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P2 and P6). Effective inventory management is currently hindered by 'stockout cycles' where arrivals are immediately consumed by backlogged/current demand. Current on-hand is 0, with 450 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 115 units over the last six periods (P10-P15). Given the risk of 3-period lead times and losses, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the current demand regime (~115 units/period), resulting in a targeted protection level of ~460 units (115 * 4), which aligns with the current pipeline. This approach acknowledges the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) while accounting for supply unreliability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $556.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly volatile with lead times alternating between 1 and 3 periods, and frequent lost shipments (P2, P6, and possibly P14). Demand has spiked significantly in Period 16 to 195, though the recent average (P11-P16) is approximately 129 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 341 units in transit (P14, P16, and P17 orders). I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed maximum lead time and supply unreliability. Demand mu_hat will be set using the last 5 periods (avg ~130) to account for the recent volume increase. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture the high volatility seen in the latest period.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 16 (195 units); recent 5-period mean increased to ~130 units. Supply chain remains high-risk with lead times of 1-3 periods and continued shipment losses (P2, P6, and P14 now at L=3 with no arrival).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly higher regime. Period 17 saw demand of 251, following a spike of 195 in Period 16. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 154 units, a substantial increase from the previous ~115 average. The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable: while some shipments arrive in 1 period (P16 order), most successful deliveries take 3 periods, and orders from Period 2 and Period 6 are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With total in-transit at 466 and a lead time effectively oscillating between 1 and 3, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to safeguard against frequent stockouts and using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent sharp demand surge. The OR backend will target a base stock covering (3+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike confirmed: Periods 16-17 show a high-demand regime (avg ~223) compared to Period 11-15 (avg ~112). Base stock must adjust to this ~100% increase in volume.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime triggered at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (195, 251, 189) averages ~211.7 units per period, compared to the previous mean of ~115. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced multiple stockouts. The supply chain remains highly volatile with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and several confirmed lost orders (P2, P6). Based on the most recent 3-period lead time observed for substantial orders (P13, P14) and the risk of loss, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for sufficient pipeline inventory. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sharp increase in both mean and volatility observed since Period 16. This should help the OR engine calculate a base stock target that reflects current high-volume reality and the 3-period lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at P16: mean increased from ~115 to ~212 (+84%) with significantly higher volatility. Maintain L=3 planning due to continued delivery instability.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the last 4 periods (16-19), the demand is 195, 251, 189, and 177, averaging 203. This is a significant increase from the previous mean (~115). I will use recent_N=4 for Mu_hat to capture this shift. The supply chain continues to be highly volatile with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and several confirmed lost orders (P2, P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite heavy demand. Since shipments often take up to 3 periods to arrive and are frequently lost, I set L=3 via the explicit method to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer pipeline needs (L+1 periods of demand coverage). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this high-demand period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~115 to approximately 213 units per period (Periods 16-20 mean: 213.2). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a massive in-transit pipeline of 905 units (orders from P17, P18, P19), no arrivals occurred in Periods 18, 19, or 20. Historical data confirms the supply chain is highly unstable, with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and multiple lost orders (P2, P6). To protect against this volatility and the higher demand floor, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent maximum lead time. Mu_hat is set to the mean of the last 5 periods (213.2) scaled by (1+L), and Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture the increased demand volatility (~36.3) scaled by sqrt(1+L). This conservative approach aims to build enough stock to cover the extended lead times seen in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: High demand regime (avg ~213) sustained for 5 periods (P16-P20). Massive delivery gap detected: zero arrivals in P18-P20 despite large orders in P17-P19, confirming L can exceed 3 or reflect significant batching/delays.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis. We are in a high-demand regime (P16-P21 average ~217 units) but have received zero arrivals since Period 17, despite orders of 194, 262, and 177 units in Periods 17, 18, and 19. Inventory on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 915 units. The actual lead time has clearly drifted beyond the previously observed L=3; orders from P17, P18, and P19 are now 5, 4, and 3 periods old respectively without arriving. I will explicitly set L=5 to reflect this sustained delay and prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the 2-period promised lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the current high-demand regime, which has stabilized at a much higher mean (~217) than the historical average. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. This approach forced the OR backend to target a higher inventory level to compensate for the massive pipeline and higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 21: Lead times for larger orders (P17-P19) have extended to 5+ periods, causing a prolonged stockout since P18. Pipeline inventory is currently 915 units.

The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption. There have been no arrivals since Period 17 (6 consecutive periods of zero arrivals), despite 1189 units being in-transit. The orders from Period 17 (194 units), Period 18 (262 units), and Period 19 (177 units) are now all beyond the previously observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, with L now reaching 6 periods for those specific orders. This indicates either a massive logistics bottleneck or a series of lost shipments. Simultaneously, demand has shifted to a significantly higher regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 226.5 units over the last 6 periods (P17-P22). To address this, I will set an explicit lead time of 6 periods to reflect the current delay and use an explicit mu_hat based on the new high-demand mean (~226) multiplied by (1+L). This results in (1+6) * 226 = 1582. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for heightened volatility in this high-demand, high-uncertainty phase. The OR backend will likely cap the order due to the large pipeline, but these parameters signal the extreme demand and lead-time pressure.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis: No arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23) despite 1189 units in-transit. Actual lead time for active orders now exceeds 5 periods. Demand regime remains elevated at ~226 units/period (P17-P22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, a significant arrival of 284 units (from P21 and P22) finally broke a 6-period stockout streak, though large orders from P17-P19 (totaling 633 units) remain missing and are likely lost given the elapsed time. The lead time remains highly volatile, showing a recent 'flip' to shorter durations (L=1 and L=2) despite previous long delays. Demand is consistently high; excluding the recent arrival period, the mean demand since the P16 regime shift is approximately 222 units. To prevent over-ordering in case the missing P17-P19 units eventually arrive, while acknowledging the current high demand, I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility (N=8 to capture the high-demand regime). I will set L to 3 periods explicitly to provide a safety buffer against the supply chain's known unreliability, as planning for the promised L=2 has historically led to stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered from a 6-period arrival drought in Period 23, with L=1 and L=2 for recent orders, but orders from P17, P18, and P19 are now presumed lost (4-6 periods elapsed). High-demand regime (avg ~222) sustained since Period 16.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered from the zero-arrival drought (P18-P22), but reliability remains low. Orders from P17 (194 units), P18 (262 units), and P19 (177 units) are now 5-7 periods old and significantly exceed the maximum successful lead time of 3 periods; I am treating these 633 units as lost. Current pipeline inventory is 1225, but after subtracting the lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is 592 units (from P22-P23 orders). Demand has stabilized in a high-regime state since Period 16, with the last 5-period mean at approximately 232 units. To prevent further stockouts given the high volatility and risk of loss, I will maintain planning for a lead time of 3 periods and use the high-demand regime (last 9 periods, P16-P24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~230 unit average rather than the long-term average of ~150.

Carry-over insight: P17, P18, and P19 orders (633 units total) are confirmed lost after 5+ periods of delay. Effective pipeline inventory should exclude these units for accurate base stock calculation.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the first 15 periods. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 213 units, compared to the early-game average of ~100. Supply chain instability remains a primary concern. We previously confirmed that orders from P17 (194 units), P18 (262 units), and P19 (177 units) are lost (633 units total). Although 'In-transit' shows 905 units, the functional pipeline is only 272 units (905 total - 633 lost). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an adjustment for the confirmed lost pipeline. With L=3 (to account for frequent delays) and a target mean of ~215, the required base stock is high. By providing a high explicit mu_hat of 1493 (approx (1+3)*215 + 633 to offset the lost units), I ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order that compensates for the lost inventory while maintaining a service level for the current high-demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a high-volume state that began around Period 16. While demand in Period 26 dropped significantly (95 units), the average demand over the last 10 periods (including stockout periods with recorded demand) is approximately 201 units. We rely on the recent 10-period mean to capture this higher volatility while smoothing out the outlier in Period 26. The supply chain has recovered from the complete drought, but remains unreliable; we stick with a lead time planning value (L) of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of further lost shipments. Current on-hand inventory is 54. The in-transit inventory of 1335 units is misleading because we've confirmed P17, P18, and P19 orders (633 total units) are lost. Effective pipeline inventory is 1335 - 633 = 102 units. The OR backend will use the parameters to target a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), adjusted for the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-drought demand volatility: Demand dropped to 95 in P26 after averaging ~220 for 10 periods. Monitoring for a potential regime shift or mean-reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently zeroed out following a demand period of 84 units. Analyzing recent performance, demand has significantly dropped in the last two periods (95 and 84) from a long-sustained high-demand regime of ~220. However, the supply chain remains the primary concern. In Period 25, we confirmed that orders from P17 (194 units), P18 (262 units), and P19 (177 units) were lost (total 633 units). While the 'In-transit' figure is reported as 1335 units, the functional pipeline is effectively 702 units (1335 minus the 633 lost units). Using L=3 based on historical volatility and recent supply failures ensures we account for the lead time variance. For demand (mu_hat), I am transitioning to a shorter lookback (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent sharp decline in demand while maintaining a buffer against the previous high-volatility regime. This avoids over-ordering if the demand drop is permanent while staying protected given the zero on-hand status and the 633-unit hole in the reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction detected: Periods 26-27 averaged 89.5 units, down from ~220 (P16-P25). Adjusting forecast lookback to prioritize recent shifts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a high-demand regime (~220 units, P16-P25) into a lower-demand regime. The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand of 95, 84, and 121, averaging 100 units/period. The lead time behavior seems to have stabilized back toward the promised 2 periods (P26 order arrived in P28, L=2; P23 order arrived in P25, L=2). Inventory is currently high (309 on-hand) due to the arrival of the large P26 order (430 units) just as demand dropped. To avoid excessive holding costs in this new low-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to use a recent_N of 3, capturing the current ~100 unit/period mean. I will maintain L=3 as a conservative buffer for the backend calculation, reflecting historical volatility, even though recent arrivals was L=2. The pipeline inventory (905) likely still contains the stale/lost units from P17-P19 as noted in the history; however, the OR backend's capped policy and the current surplus on-hand will naturally prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: mean decreased from ~220 to ~100 (-55%). Lead time has stabilized at L=2 for the last two major arrivals (P23 and P26 orders).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a lower demand regime (mean ~100) that began around Period 26, contrasting with the high-demand period (mean ~220) observed between Periods 16-25. Recent demand values (P26-P29: 95, 84, 121, 98) average 99.5. Lead times have stabilized significantly, with the last three major successful deliveries (P21, P22, P23, P26 orders) arriving within 1-2 periods. However, the supply chain history shows frequent shifts and lost shipments (P17, P18, P19 orders), justifying a conservative lead time setting of L=2 or L=3. On-hand inventory is healthy (211), and there are 905 units in-transit. A large portion of the in-transit inventory (633 units from P17-P19) is confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 272 units. For Period 30, I will use a recent_N lookback of 4 for mu_hat (N=4 corresponds to the start of the current low-demand regime) to avoid over-ordering based on the previous high-demand spike. I use default for L to leverage the backend's promised lead time (2) while the system stabilizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following the high-demand period (P16-P25). For the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 103 units, which is a significant drop from the previous average of ~220. My current on-hand inventory is 94 units. The 'In-transit' balance shown in the snapshot (905 units) is highly misleading because it includes several orders confirmed lost (P6, P17, P18, P19 total 765 units). The actual active pipeline consists of orders placed recently that are yet to arrive. Given the history of lead time volatility (1 to 3+ periods) and the critical need to avoid over-ordering during this low-demand regime while accounting for potential lead time delays, I will set L=3 as a safety measure. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture the new demand average (~103 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the supply chain's known unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~103 units/period (P26-P30). Significant pipeline inflation: 'In-transit' includes 765 units from lost orders (P6, P17-P19), which should be ignored in inventory calculations.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a new mean of ~105 units/period following a regime shift at Period 26 (mean from Period 26-31 is ~103.7). The supply chain remains unpredictable, frequently oscillating between L=1 and L=3 with a high rate of lost shipments. Specifically, the 'In-transit' figure of 905 units is heavily inflated by lost orders from Period 6 (132), Period 17 (194), Period 18 (262), and Period 19 (177), totaling 765 'phantom' units. To account for this, the OR backend must be configured to place a replenishment order despite the high visible pipeline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand level. Because the backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the order quantity, and the pipeline is artificially high, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to increase the base stock calculation, compensating for the expected non-arrival of the older pipeline units. This ensures we order enough to prevent another stockout given the 0 on-hand inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26. The last 7 periods (P26-P32) show a mean demand of approximately 104 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112). I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 905 units is heavily distorted by significantly overdue shipments that are presumed lost based on historical performance (P6, P17, P18, P19 orders total 765 units). The actual active pipeline is much smaller. However, since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'over-order' and force the system to account for the lost stock. The target base stock for L=3 (to protect against volatility) at ~104 units/period is (3+1)*104 = 416. To counteract 765 lost units being subtracted from this 416 target, I will set mu_hat explicitly high so that (Target - 905) results in a meaningful order. Specifically, I want a target around 1100 units to trigger an order of ~200. Calculating mu_hat as (1+L)*350 approx.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 905 units includes 765 units from lost orders (P6: 132, P17: 194, P18: 262, P19: 177). Only 140 units are realistically in the active pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26, stabilizing at a mean of ~105 units/period (last 8 periods mean is 105.1). The supply chain is notoriously unreliable with many lost shipments. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1173 units is misleadingly high due to historical lost orders (P6, P17, P18, P19 totaling 765 units). Subtracting these, the realistic pipeline is 408 units (P33 order of 268 + other smaller active flows). I am setting L=3 explicitly to account for the frequent lead-time extensions observed in the history (flipping between 1 and 3 periods). Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures the current lower demand level after the spike peaked at Period 25. This setting should help the OR backend calculate a base stock that ignores 'ghost' units in the pipeline and focuses on current demand levels and historical lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Subtract 765 'ghost' units from the in-transit total (lost orders from P6, P17, P18, P19). Active pipeline as of Period 34 is 408 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an 'In-transit' total of 1173 units. However, as documented in previous carry-over insights, 765 of these units are from lost orders (P6: 132, P17: 194, P18: 262, P19: 177) that have failed to arrive for over 15 periods. The active pipeline consists only of the order from Period 33 (268 units). The demand regime has clearly shifted back to a lower level since Period 26, averaging approximately 101 units over the last 9 periods. Given the high unreliability of the supply chain (frequent losses and lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime (P26-P34). The OR backend uses a pipeline inventory that includes the 765 'ghost' units, which will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the expected demand plus the ghost inventory gap to force an order that replenishes stock.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 104 units per period (mean of P26-P35). The supply chain remains high-risk with a history of lost shipments (P6, P17, P18, P19 totaling 765 units). While recent successful arrivals showed lead times of 1-2 periods, the system frequently reverts to 3-period lead times or complete losses. To mitigate stockout risk given the current zero on-hand inventory, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. For demand, I am using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current stable regime (P26-P35). The in-transit inventory of 1194 includes 765 'ghost' units, leaving an active pipeline of 429 units (P33 order of 268 + P35 order of 21 + P27-P31 zero orders + some older residual). Since base stock = (1+L)*mu_hat, the target is roughly 4*104 = 416. With 429 active units in-transit, the OR backend might order little or nothing, which is appropriate given the large P33 shipment still pending.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: In-transit inventory continues to be inflated by 765 'ghost' units from historically lost orders (P6, P17, P18, P19). Active pipeline monitored at ~429 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 103 units per period since Period 26 (mean of P26-P36 is ~103). The 'In-transit' inventory of 1194 units is highly misleading because it includes 765 units from orders that are confirmed lost (P6, P17, P18, P19). When excluding these 'ghost' units, the active pipeline is 429 units (orders from P33 and P35). Despite this active pipeline, no arrivals have occurred for 8 consecutive periods (P29-P36), even though the most recent successful deliveries had a lead time of 2 periods. This indicates either a new supply chain drought or that lead times have again extended significantly beyond the promised 2 periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L=3 to account for the frequent delays. I set mu_hat to 721 (calculated as (1+L)*103 + 309 to buffer for the current stockout and the 3-period lead time). I set sigma_hat to 30 based on recent volatility. This configuration aims to overcome the pipeline inflation and secure stock for the stabilization of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: 8-period arrival drought confirmed (P29-P36). Active pipeline (excluding 765 ghost units) is 429 units. Supply chain remains extremely unreliable.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly volatile with frequent arrival droughts. We are currently in a drought that started after Period 28 (except for a small arrival in P37). There is a massive 1173 units recorded 'in-transit', but historical analysis indicates that 765 units are 'ghost' units from lost orders (P6, P17, P18, P19). Therefore, the active pipeline is actually 408 units (1173 - 765). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime of approximately 100 units/period since Period 26 (recent 5-period mean: 88; recent 10-period mean: 98). Despite the low on-hand inventory (0), the active pipeline of 408 units is theoretically enough to cover about 4 periods of demand at the current rate. However, given the extreme unreliability and the fact that the P33 order (268 units) is now 4 periods late (exceeding the longest successful L=3), I will maintain L=3 for planning. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the shift to ~100 units while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat to handle the high lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Order from Period 33 (268 units) is now 4 periods late, approaching 'lost' status if it does not arrive next period. Active pipeline consists only of P33 (268) and P35 (arrived) units; with 765 units still confirmed as ghost/lost stock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 100 units/period (mean of P26-P38 is ~101). Supply chain instability remains the primary challenge. We are currently in another arrival drought (only one small order of 21 units arrived in the last 10 periods). 'In-transit' is reported as 1173 units, but 'ghost' units from lost orders (P6, P17, P18, P19) total 765, meaning the active pipeline is only 408 units (P33 order of 268 and any subsequent small orders). Since on-hand is 0 and the P33 order is now 5 periods late (exceeding our max successful lead time of 3), it is likely lost. I will set L to 3 to account for historical delays and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=13) to capture the current 100-unit demand regime while ignoring the high-demand peak (P16-P25). Given the massive pipeline inflation, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would normally result in 0; however, by using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am attempting to ensure the inventory target is set high enough to eventually trigger replenishment once the backend reconciles the pipeline, or simply continuing the defensive stance for the next review period.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 33 (268 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed (6 periods elapsed, max successful L=3). Ghost units in pipeline now total 1033 (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). Active pipeline is effectively 0.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Period 39 confirms that the order from Period 33 (268 units) is lost, joining previous lost orders from P6, P17, P18, and P19. The total 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline is now 1,033 units (132+194+262+177+268). With a reported In-Transit of 1,173 units, the active pipeline is only 140 units (likely the orders from P35/P37-P39, though only 21 units from P35 arrived and P37-P39 had zero orders). On-hand inventory is 0 and demand has stabilized at ~100 units/period (mean of P26-P39 is 100.2). To break the stockout caused by the lost P33 order, I must force a new order. By setting L=3 (to account for frequent delays) and using a recent_N lookback of 14 (P26-P39) for demand, the OR backend will calculate a base stock. However, since the internal OR logic subtracts the 'In-transit' (1173) from the base stock, it will likely result in a zero order. To override this and account for the 1033 'ghost' units, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand across (L+1) periods plus a significant buffer to offset the ghost pipeline inventory, ensuring the backend triggers an order approximately equal to the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory reaches 1,033 units (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). Effective pipeline is currently near zero. Demand remains stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. There is a confirmed list of 'ghost' inventory totaling 1,033 units (orders from P6, P17, P18, P19, and P33) which are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are presumed lost. These units are still reflected in the 'In-transit' total of 1,485, making the active pipeline effectively 452 units (largely from the P40 order of 312). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 100 units per period since Period 26 (mean of last 5: 99). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the 'ghost' inventory inflation, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods, while being aware that the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. I will use L=3 to account for the frequent delays, and set mu_hat based on the current regime (100 units/period * 4 = 400). Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of the recent stable regime to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory remains at 1,033 units (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). Effective pipeline is currently 452 units. Supply chain remains high-risk with frequent losses and a suspected maximum lead time of 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary concern. Since Period 29, we have experienced several arrival droughts, with the most recent order from Period 35 arriving in Period 37 (L=2). Orders from Period 33 (268 units) and much older orders (P6, P17, P18, P19 totaling 765 units) are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory (lost/severely delayed), which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure of 1485. The real active pipeline consists only of the order from P40 (312 units). Demand has stabilized in a regime of approximately 100-110 units (mean of last 5: 110.4). I will set L to 3 periods to account for the frequent shipment failures and delays. I use recent_N (N=16, dating back to the regime shift at P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized demand level which is slightly higher in the very recent samples (P40-P41). Setting L=3 and mu_hat to 4 periods of demand ensures a robust base stock to protect against the 0 on-hand status and supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain volatility remains high; active pipeline excludes 1033 units of 'ghost' inventory from P6, P17, P18, P19, and P33. Actual active pipeline is only 312 units (P40).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with periodic 'droughts' and significant lost shipments. Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33) totals 1,033 units. While the displayed in-transit is 1,485, the active pipeline is only 452 units (P40 order). Demand has returned to a stable regime averaging approximately 106 units per period since P26 (P26-P42 avg = 106). Since on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is thin, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected lead time plus review period. Although the promised L is 2, historical actuals often hit 3 or result in loss. I will use L=3 to ensure the backend targets a higher base stock to buffer against these frequent delivery failures. Using N=15 for mu_hat captures the post-spike demand stability (since P26).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains 1,033 units (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). Demand stable since P26 at ~106 units/period. Supply chain continues to toggle between L=2 and total loss.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 106 units per period since Period 26 (mean of P26-P43: ~106, std: ~24). The supply chain remains highly unstable, characterized by frequent shipments that are either lost or significantly delayed. Specifically, orders from P6, P17, P18, P19, and P33 (totaling 1,033 units) are confirmed 'ghost units' that inflate the 'In-transit' figure but never arrived. In P43, we saw an arrival from P40 (L=3), leaving the current effective pipeline at 0 units. To account for the 1,033 ghost units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the target base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods) as: 4 * 106 = 424. To this, I add the 1,033 ghost units to 'neutralize' them in the backend subtraction (Base Stock - Pipeline), resulting in a mu_hat of 1,457. I set L=3 to reflect the high-risk reality of the supply chain and sigma_hat explicitly to cover volatility during the 4-period risk horizon.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units per period since the significant drop in Period 26 (recent 10-period avg: 108.5). The supply chain remains unreliable with a delivery pattern toggling between L=2, L=3, and total loss. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1308 units, but 1033 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost orders (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). The active pipeline consists only of the Period 44 order (135 units) and potentially recent unscheduled orders if any. I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to capture the post-spike stability (approx 420 for L+1=4) and maintain L=3 for the inventory policy to buffer against the frequent 3-period lead times and high loss risk. Setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent demand volatility (std ~30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 26, with the last 5 periods (P41-P45) averaging 99.8 units (142, 79, 122, 65, 91). I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period window to capture this stability. For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 3, as the most recent successful delivery (P40 order) arrived with L=3, and the history shows frequent delays and losses. The 'In-transit' figure of 1308 is heavily inflated by 1033 'ghost' units from historically lost or extremely overdue orders (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). The true active pipeline consists only of the order from P44 (135 units). By setting L=3, I provide enough cushion for the OR backend to target a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand (~400 units), accounting for the current on-hand of 34 and the active pipeline of 135.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost inventory (lost orders) confirmed at 1,033 units (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33). Active pipeline as of P46 is 135 units (from P44). Demand stability around 100 units/period continues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary risk factor. Current in-transit inventory (1308) is heavily inflated by 1033 units from 'ghost' orders (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33) which are confirmed lost or severely delayed beyond any useful horizon. The only valid active pipeline unit is the order from Period 44 (135 units). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 103 units over the last 20 periods (P26-P46), with recent fluctuations between 65 and 142. My strategy is to set L=3 to account for the frequent maximum observed lead time, while using an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current demand regime (~103 units per period) projected over the (L+1) horizon. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1308) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for the 1033 ghost units to trigger an actual order, as the active pipeline is currently insufficient to cover the next 4 periods of demand.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with periodic total shipment losses. Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (orders confirmed lost from P6, P17, P18, P19, and P33) remains at 1,033 units. In-transit inventory is currently 1,487 units, but the active pipeline is only 454 units (1,487 - 1,033 = 454). Demand is stable in the current regime (Period 26 to Period 47), averaging approximately 101 units per period. Lead times for successful deliveries range between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2; however, due to the high frequency of complete losses, planning should continue to assume an effective L=3 buffer to protect against service level drops. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Period 47 had a demand of 82 and 0 sales due to a stockout. Setting parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers the 4-period window (L+1) while being mindful of the significant ghost inventory in the system balance.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period since Period 26, though recent periods (P44-P48) show a slightly lower average of ~86 units. The supply chain remains high-risk with 'ghost' inventory totaling 1,301 units (orders from P6, P17, P18, P19, P33, and now P41, which is 7 periods late). The current in-transit of 1,487 includes these 1,301 ghost units, meaning the active pipeline inventory is only 186 units (the P44 order of 135 and the P47 order of 179 are currently in legitimate lead-time windows). Given the game ends at Period 50, and our current on-hand is 0, we need to ensure enough is ordered to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the unreliable lead time (L=3 is the safest successful max). However, with only 2 periods left in the game and on-hand at 0, large orders are unlikely to arrive and fulfill demand before the game ends. I will set parameters to maintain a baseline but recognize that shipments placed now will likely not arrive in time for the final period's resolution.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost inventory (lost orders) increased to 1,301 units (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33, and P41). P41 order of 312 units is now 8 periods late and presumed lost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted with multiple lost shipments and significant delivery delays. Ghost inventory (lost orders) has reached a total of 1,301 units (P6, P17, P18, P19, P33, and P41). Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 1,487 units reveals an active pipeline of only 186 units (largely from orders in P44 and P47). Demand has been stable since P26, averaging approximately 100 units per period. Despite the promised lead time of 2, actual successful lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, while many other orders are lost entirely. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and the active pipeline is only 186 units, we need more stock to cover a planning horizon of 4 periods (L=3 + 1 review period), which requires roughly 400 units. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the high-risk environment and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=20) to capture the stable regime of ~100 units/period since Period 26. This setup ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for delivery volatility while ignoring the inflated ghost inventory.
