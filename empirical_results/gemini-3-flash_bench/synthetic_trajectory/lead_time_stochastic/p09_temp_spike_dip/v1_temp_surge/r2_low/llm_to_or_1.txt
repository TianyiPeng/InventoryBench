Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no prior history or concluding message to review. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 is provided: [131, 92, 118, 125, 106]. The average demand over these 5 samples is 114.4 units per period. Since L=2, the review period plus lead time (L+1) is 3 periods. To minimize the risk of a stockout early on, especially starting with 0 inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the provided historical average. The OR backend will compute the base stock. Given Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning z* = 0; the backend will target the mean demand. The cap mechanism will further protect against over-ordering.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 141 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. The Period 1 conclude message shows demand was 46, but since arrivals occur after the decision phase and the starting inventory was 0, those 46 units were lost sales (sold=0). The 141 units are currently in-transit. Based on the 5 pre-game samples (Avg: 114.6) and Period 1's actual demand (46), the mean demand appears lower than the initial samples suggested, but with only one period of data, it is too early to declare a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to incorporate the lower P1 demand while still weighting the pre-game samples, and stay with 'default' for lead time (2 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making them visible in Period 4's start). Orders placed in Period 2 (136 units) are expected in Period 4. Therefore, 'arrived=0' in Period 1 and 2 concludes is normal behavior for L=2. Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts because demand (46 in P1, 131 in P2) could not be met. Total in-transit is 277 units (141+136). Historical demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106], while actual realized demand in P1 and P2 was 46 and 131. The mean of all 7 samples is 107. Since we are in the early stages and have no confirmed lead-time drift or regime shift, I will use default settings to establish a baseline. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. No arrivals have been recorded yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (Order from P1 is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible in P4's start-of-period conclude, but P1 conclude happened at the start of P2). Specifically: P1 order (141 units) should arrive during P3 resolution and be reported in the P3 conclude message, but P3 conclude reports arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. On-hand is 0 and we have lost sales in Periods 1, 2, and 3 because arrivals haven't started. Demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106]. Mean demand is ~114. Given the 100% loss of sales so far due to stockouts, I need to ensure the pipeline is healthy. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the delayed arrival of the Period 1 order, and use all 5 demand samples (recent_N=5) to forecast future demand. This increases the base stock to cover a longer lead time (L+1=4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is longer than promised: P1 order (141 units) did not arrive by P3 conclude, implying L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of previous orders. The P1 order arrived after 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived after only 1 period. This indicates high lead-time variability (actual lead times of 3 and 1 against a promise of 2). The P2 order (136 units) is still in transit after 2 periods, suggesting it might arrive in the next period (L=3). The demand history (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) shows a relatively stable mean around 114. Given the inventory on-hand (55) and the large P2 order still in transit (136), total pipeline inventory is 191. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to incorporate the observed variability. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use all 5 available samples (N=5) to establish a baseline forecast, as no significant demand shift is detected.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly variable (observed L=1 and L=3); P2 order (136 units) remains in transit after 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand and 345 units in-transit. Historical demand over 5 periods is: 131, 92 (inferred Period 2), 118 (inferred Period 3), 125 (inferred Period 4), 106 (Period 5), with mean ~114 units. Lead time is highly volatile: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in just 1 period. Notably, the Period 2 order (136 units) is still in-transit after 3 periods (ordered Period 2, not arrived by Period 5 conclude), further confirming a lead time that can exceed the promised 2 periods. To protect against this variability and the current stockout, I am setting the lead time (L) parameter to an explicit value of 3. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average demand of 114 units per period across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the observed demand volatility in the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 order (L=3), P3 order (L=1), and P2 order (L>3) show extreme variance compared to promised L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (P1-P6) shows a mean of approximately 112 units per period (46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171). The lead time behavior is highly unstable: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), while P2 (ordered in P1, 136 units) is still missing after 5 periods and is likely lost. P4 (75 units), P5 (134 units), and P6 (55 units) are currently in transit. Given the high probability of lost shipments or significant delays, I will set L explicitly to 3 to increase the base stock level and pipeline buffer. For demand (mu_hat), utilizing a recent_N of 5 provides a mean of 125 per period, which captures the recent spike (171). Sigma_hat is set via recent_N to account for the high volatility in sales data.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (136 units) likely lost: remains undelivered 5 periods after ordering. Demand shows rising volatility with a peak of 171 in P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The history shows significant lead-time instability and a lost shipment (Period 2 order of 136 units is now 6 periods overdue). Observed lead times are: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), and P4 (L=3). The average of converged shipments is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Given the risk of lost orders and the current zero on-hand inventory, I will set L to 3 explicitly to provide more buffer in the pipeline calculation. For demand, the recent mean (P1-P7) is ~109 units. However, we have experienced stockouts (P5, P6, P7) where demand exceeded sales or availability. In P6, demand spiked to 171. To better mirror this variance and avoid constant stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and higher demand peaks (mean of last 5: 117). This will raise the base stock level to account for both the increased lead time and the supply chain unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean shift: Calculated lead time (avg of P1, P3, P4) is 2.33 periods; explicitly using L=3 to mitigate stockout risk from high variance and lost orders.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 149 units on-hand and 235 units in-transit (orders from P6 and P8). Historically, lead times have been highly volatile (observed values: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1), averaging 2.2 periods. The order from P2 (136 units) is still missing after 7 periods and is considered lost. The demand is currently averaging ~106 units per period. Given the high probability of delivery delays (sustained L=3 in several instances) and the risk of lost orders, I am maintaining an explicit lead time estimate of L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the most recent 5 periods (P4-P8) to capture the current demand mean (~116) and volatility, which is more representative than the full history.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (136 units) confirmed lost (7 periods since order). Demand mean for most recent 5 periods is 116.8 (up from 88 in first 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 93. Looking at the history, lead times are highly variable: L=3 (P1, P4, P5) and L=1 (P3, P7, P8). The average observed lead time is 2.0 periods ((3+1+3+3+1+1)/6), matching the promised L=2, but the variance is significant and the P2 order is confirmed lost. My previous explicit setting of L=3 was to buffer against volatility, but since recent arrivals (P7, P8) have been fast (L=1), I will use the 'calculate' method to let the backend utilize all observed lead-time data. Demand has stabilized after the P6 spike: the last three periods (P7-P9) show 93, 85, and 100 units. A recent_N window of 5 covers the post-spike period effectively (P5-P9 avg: 110.8). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand level and its associated volatility while ignoring the early-period zeros caused by stockouts.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 (demand 97, sold 93). The pipeline inventory is 332 units, comprising orders from P2 (136 - likely lost), P6 (55), P9 (84), and P10 (57). Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1 periods. While the average is 2, the variance is high and the 'lost' P2 order (now 9 periods old) creates a phantom in-transit balance that the OR engine will count as available. This risk of stockout due to high lead-time volatility and lost shipments justifies a conservative approach. I will maintain L=3 explicitly to force a higher base stock. Demand mean over the last 7 periods (P4-P10) is 111.57, which is higher than the initial average. I'll use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this slightly higher regime and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (e.g., the 171 spike in P6).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Period 11 (81 units of demand missed). The pipeline inventory is currently 447 units (from orders in Periods 6, 9, 10, 11). Lead time remains highly volatile and unreliable: recent observed lead times are P4 (L=3), P7 (L=3), P8 (L=3, L=1), and P9 (L=1). The P2 order (136 units) from Period 2 is definitively lost. The P6 order (55 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost as well. To counter this reliability issue, I will continue using an explicit lead time of L=3, which is more representative of the longer arrivals seen in the history. Demand mean over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 91.2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and prevent over-indexing on earlier data.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (55 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods since ordering with no arrival. Lead time remains highly volatile (range 1-3 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, P9 and P10 orders arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. P2 and P6 orders are definitively lost. The lead time is extremely volatile, showing values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with a high risk of lost shipments. To protect against stockouts given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), I am setting L to explicit value 3 to reflect the realistic upper bound of successful deliveries and accommodate the pipeline requirement (L+1 periods of coverage). Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) shows a stable mean of 91.2 units (85, 100, 97, 81, 93). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand regime while maintaining a high safety buffer for the delivery uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution stabilized between 1-3 periods for successful deliveries, but 15-20% of orders (P2, P6) are lost completely.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 13 (demand 125 vs on-hand 48). The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 317 units includes orders from Period 11 (115 units), Period 12 (0 units), and Period 13 (11 units). The lead time remains highly volatile and prone to loss: P2 (136 units) and P6 (55 units) are definitely lost. Successful lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods (Average ~2.22). Given the significant loss rate (~15%) and the current zero on-hand status, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the upper bound of delivery and provide a safety buffer for the backend calculation. For demand, the last 5 periods (P9-P13) show a mean of 99.2 units per period with a slight increase in variance. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while excluding the outlier demand of 171 from Period 6.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe on-hand inventory of 8 units with 282 units in-transit. Historical lead times for delivered orders (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11) are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3], averaging 2.22 periods. However, significant order loss (P2, P6) and frequent 3-period lead times necessitate a conservative approach. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for this 'effectively' longer lead time and the risk of loss. For demand (mu_hat), the mean of the last 10 periods (P5-P14) is 108.7. Using recent_N=10 allows us to capture the current demand regime which is slightly higher than the initial periods. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to maintain a high enough base stock to cushion against both late deliveries and potential order losses, balancing the equal costs of understocking and overstocking (Profit=$1, Holding=$1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stockout (On-hand: 0) and high lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods, plus lost orders). In Period 15, we had an ending inventory of 0 after selling only 8 units against a demand of 123. The total in-transit is 415 units, but historical evidence (Carry-over insights) confirms that Period 2 and Period 6 orders were lost. Removing these from the pipeline (136 + 55 = 191 units) leaves an effective 'In-transit' of 224 units (Orders from P13, P14, P15). Given the promised lead time of 2 and actual observations often hitting 3, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is 106.6 units, reflecting a stable yet significant demand level. I will use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and volume, while using an explicit L=3 to account for the risk of delivery delays and prevent further stockouts in this high-uncertainty environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand is spiking (Period 16 demand 164), leading to stockouts. Arrivals have been infrequent: the order from Period 14 (80 units) is now one period past its promised lead time (2 periods) but within the observed maximum lead time of 3. The P2 and P6 orders are confirmed lost, establishing a pattern of ~15% order loss. 

Lead Time Analysis: Observed successful lead times are 1, 2, and 3 periods. To mitigate against the high variance and the specific risk of 3-period arrivals or lost shipments, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the pipeline length.

Demand Analysis: Demand has increased significantly in the last few periods (Mean of last 5: 122.4 vs historical mean: 106). Period 16 was a notable outlier (164). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent upward trend and volatility. 

Risk Mitigation: High holding costs ($1) relative to profit ($1) suggest a safety stock level around the 50th percentile (z=0), but the frequency of lost orders and stockouts necessitates a slightly more robust inventory position to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Average demand of last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 122.4, an increase from early periods (~100). Period 16 demand (164) is a historical peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has trended significantly upward, with the last two periods showing 164 and 194 respectively (historical peaks). The average demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 140.6 units, a sharp increase from the early 100-unit average. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a history of lost orders (P2, P6). Currently, 395 units are in-transit, including the large P15 order (133 units) which is expected this period or next. Due to the significant increase in both demand mean and volatility, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher consumption rate and using explicit L=3 to maintain a safety buffer against the consistent lead-time delays and potential losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Period 16-17 demand averaged 179 (+79% over baseline), with P17 hitting a new peak of 194. Pipeline inventory is heavy (395 units) but reliability is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a period of sharply increased demand. The last three periods (P16-P18) show a mean of 180 units (164, 194, 182), which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100-115. On-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to recent deliveries (P13, P14, P16) being much smaller than demand. Although 571 units are in transit, historical data (P2, P6) shows a ~15% order loss rate and extreme lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods). To protect against stockouts during this high-demand regime, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 to reflect a mean of 180 over (1+L) periods. I am choosing an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 3-period maximum observed delay and the high loss risk, effectively building a buffer while the pipeline catches up.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P18 avg: 180 vs baseline ~110). Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods with a persistent ~15% order loss rate.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has averaged 184.75 (164, 194, 182, 199), significantly higher than the early baseline. Despite heavy pipeline inventory (720 units), the on-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to demand spikes and the inherent volatility of lead times (range 1-3 periods) and order losses (P2 and P6 confirmed lost). Given the high loss rate and 3-period maximum lead time, I will set L to 3 periods to ensure mu_hat covers a sufficient horizon (L+1 = 4 periods). Setting mu_hat to 740 based on recent_N (N=4) captures the current average demand of ~185 per period across the lead time horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: P16-P19 average demand is 185 (+68% vs baseline ~110). Lead time remains unstable (1-3 periods) with a ~15% loss rate.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, with the average demand for the last 5 relevant periods (P16-P20) approximately 186.4, compared to the earlier baseline of ~110. Inventory is currently critical: after three consecutive periods of stockouts (P18-P20) where demand was high (182, 199, 193) but no arrivals occurred, on-hand inventory is 0. However, the pipeline is extremely high (739 units). Lead times have proven to be highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a persistent risk of lost orders (P2 and P6 confirmed lost). Given the high pipeline and the current stockout status, the goal is to stabilize the inventory level to meet the new higher demand while accounting for delivery variance. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the observed upper bound of lead time and ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the sustained high demand regime (P16-P20). sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 average demand is 186.4 (+69% over baseline ~110). Inventory stockouts for 3 consecutive periods (P18-P20) due to lead time volatility and high demand.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (P16-P21 average: ~192 units) compared to the historical baseline (~110 units). Stockouts have persisted for four consecutive periods (P18-P21) because the large pipeline (746 units) has failed to arrive, likely due to a combination of lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and the ~15% order loss rate previously observed. For Period 22, the 'in-transit' volume is extremely high (746 units), which is nearly 4x the current average demand. If even a fraction of this pipeline arrives, on-hand inventory will spike. However, we must maintain a high mu_hat to account for the current demand surge and protect against further losses. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (P16-P21). For L, I will use 'explicit' value 3, as history shows deliveries often take 3 periods when they don't arrive immediately, and this provides a safer buffer for the base-stock calculation given the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak sustained: P16-P21 average demand is 192.3 (+75% over baseline), with P21 reaching a new historical high of 222. Pipeline inventory is extremely high (746 units), but 4 consecutive periods of stockouts (P18-P21) confirm severe delivery delays or losses.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of severe supply chain instability and a high demand regime. No units have arrived since Period 17, and we have experienced 5 consecutive periods of total stockouts (P18-P22). However, there is a massive pipeline inventory of 770 units. The demand mean has shifted significantly: from P16 to P22, the average demand is roughly 189 units per period, compared to the early baseline of ~110. The lead time is extremely volatile (1-3 periods) with a significant historical loss rate (~15%). Since there are 770 units in transit (which is about 4 periods of the current high demand at ~190/period) and 0 on hand, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely result in a order of 0 or a very small amount if the base_stock calculation doesn't exceed 770. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed upper bound of lead time and mitigate stockout risk once arrivals resume. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 samples (P16-P22) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~189). Sigma_hat is set to the recent 7 periods to reflect the heightened volatility (demand peak of 222).

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival blackout: No units arrived from Period 18 through Period 22 despite a massive pipeline (770 units); high risk of either severe congestion or further lost orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (P16-P23 avg demand ~193). There has been a massive disruption in the supply chain: despite a pipeline inventory of 720 units, virtually nothing arrived between Period 18 and Period 22. In Period 23, we finally saw the arrival of orders from P20, P21, and P22, but the large orders placed in P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 529 units) are still missing. Given that P15 was ordered 8 periods ago and P17 was 6 periods ago, there is a high probability these major shipments are lost or indefinitely delayed. However, the OR backend's capped policy will prevent new orders if the 'In-transit' figure remains high. To trigger the OR engine to place necessary replacement orders despite the stalled pipeline, I am setting L to 4 to reflect the current delivery reality and using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to cover the high demand regime (~193 units/period * (1+4) = 965), and sigma_hat is increased to account for the extreme volatility in arrival reliability and demand spikes (P23 demand reached 247).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis P18-P23: Significant portion of pipeline (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 totaling 529 units) is significantly overdue (>3 periods past max observed L) and likely lost or severely delayed. P23 demand (247) marks a new historical peak, confirming the upward demand trend.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 and facing a massive supply chain disruption combined with a sustained high-demand regime. Average demand since Period 16 has risen to approximately 190.7 units/period. The pipeline inventory is technically 965 units, but as of Period 24's conclusion, orders from P15 (133), P17 (71), P18 (176), and P19 (149) totaling 529 units are severely overdue (lead times would now be 9, 7, 6, and 5 periods respectively). Historical data shows a maximum successful lead time of 3 periods; anything beyond that in this environment strongly suggests lost shipments. To rectify this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the actual maximum delay for successful deliveries. I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P16-P24) to capture the high-demand regime (avg ~191, so mu_hat approx 764). Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed in this peak demand period (approx std of 30, scaled for L+1). This configuration forces the OR backend to acknowledge that a large part of the 'In-transit' inventory is likely non-existent, triggering necessary replacement orders to meet the new service level requirements.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 529 units) are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they exceed 5+ periods versus the max observed lead time of 3. Demand regime stable at higher mean of ~191 (P16-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the supply chain remains in a state of severe disruption. We have 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 965 units. However, as noted in previous carry-over insights, a significant portion of this pipeline (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 totaling 529 units) is confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of approximately 436 units (965 - 529). Demand has stabilized at a significantly higher regime; the average demand from P16 to P25 is 195.4 units per period. Lead time remains highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a persistent loss rate. I will use L=3 to protect against stockout risk given the current volatility and high demand. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (avg ~195). sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed in this period (std dev of last 10 periods is ~29, so sqrt(1+3)*29 is approx 58). The OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size relative to the pipeline, but the high mu_hat and L will signal a need for replenishment once the backend reconciles the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~195 units/period (P16-P25 avg: 195.4). Effective pipeline reconciliation: 529 units from P15-P19 are confirmed lost, reducing actionable in-transit inventory from 965 to 436.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the supply chain remains in a critical state. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with a persistent history of stockouts. The demand regime has transitioned from a baseline of ~110 to a sustained average of ~195 units/period (P16-P25), despite a lower demand in P26 (110 units). Lead times have been highly volatile (1-3 periods), but more importantly, a large block of pipeline inventory (529 units from orders in P15, P17, P18, P19) is now confirmed lost as they are far beyond the maximum observed 3-period lead time. After adjusting the 'In-transit' figure by removing these 529 lost units, the effective (actionable) pipeline is 436 units. To protect against the ~15-20% order loss rate and the high volatility of lead times (range 1-3), I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for 4 periods of coverage (L+1). mu_hat is set to 780 (195 * 4) to reflect the current high-demand mean, and sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for demand variance and the risk of further lost shipments, forcing the OR engine to place a significant replenishment order to bridge the stockout gap.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure confirmed: 529 units from P15-P19 are permanently lost; actionable pipeline is current 'In-transit' minus 529. High demand regime (avg 195) is stable despite P26 dip.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and a demand regime that averaged approximately 195 units between Periods 16-25, though the last two periods (P26-P27) saw a decline to an average of 117.5. Given the extreme supply chain instability, I am treating the lower demand in P26-P27 as potential noise or lost demand rather than a permanent downshift, maintaining a focus on the recent high-demand regime to ensure availability. The supply chain situation is critical: 529 units (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost, as confirmed in previous carry-overs. Total 'In-transit' is 965, but after subtracting the 529 lost units, the actionable pipeline is 436 units (comprised of P20=19, P21=7, P22=24 which arrived, and P24=245, leaving P24's 245 units and some residual accounting). However, the system's 'In-transit' reflects all undelivered units. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its math, and it doesn't know about lost orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' inventory. I set L=3 based on the observed maximum lead time for successful arrivals. For mu_hat, I forecast a mean demand of 190 per period; over (1+L)=4 periods, this equals 760. To counteract the 529 units of lost inventory that the OR backend still thinks will arrive, I add 529 to the target. Thus, explicit mu_hat = 760 + 529 = 1289. This forces the system to ignore the lost 529 units when calculating the order quantity. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to account for high demand volatility (range 110-247).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the supply chain remains in a state of severe crisis. While on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 1289 units, 529 units (from P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost, and several more recent orders (P20-P24) are significantly overdue or potentially lost based on the lack of arrivals in the P28 conclude message. Demand has entered a high-mean, high-volatility regime starting around P16; although the last three periods (P26-P28) showed a temporary dip (avg 106), the broader regime average (P16-P25) was 195.4. Due to the high risk of order loss (~15-20%) and the current stockout streak, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend captures the maximum observed lead time. mu_hat is set to explicit (600) to account for (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the high-regime average (~150/period), providing a safety buffer for potential losses. sigma_hat is set to explicit (150) to manage the high variance observed in both demand and delivery reliability.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure persists: orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (529 units) are permanently lost. Recent orders from P20-P24 are also showing delays, suggesting a sustained increase in effective lead time or loss rate.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe systemic collapse for 'chips(Regular)'. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0 for the 6th consecutive period despite a huge 'In-transit' pipeline of 1289 units. Critical analysis shows that orders from P15 (133), P17 (71), P18 (176), and P19 (149) totaling 529 units have not arrived after 10+ periods and are effectively lost. Furthermore, orders from P24 (245) and P28 (324) are pending. Demand has shifted from a high regime (avg ~195) to a lower recent trend (avg of P26-P29 is 97.25), possibly reflecting seasonal shifts or customer attrition due to prolonged stockouts. I am reducing the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=4 to match this lower demand while maintaining a high sigma_hat (explicitly set to 100) and an explicit lead time (L=4) to account for the ongoing supply unreliability and to force larger replenishment orders from the OR backend to break the stockout cycle once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand drop: P26-P29 avg demand is 97.25, significantly lower than the P16-P25 peak avg of ~195. Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (529 units) remain confirmed lost. Global 'In-transit' including these losses is 1289 units; actionable pipeline is 760.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (Period 26-30) shows a significant decrease, averaging 95.4 units per period, compared to the peak surge seen in Periods 16-25 (~195 units). The supply chain remains unstable, with 529 units (from P15, P17, P18, P19) confirmed lost. Current 'In-transit' of 965 includes these lost units plus the P24 order (245 units) which is now at L=6 (likely lost) and the P28 arrival which was processed last period. Subtracting the confirmed losses (529) and the likely lost (245), the actionable pipeline is 191 units. On-hand sits at 236. To avoid over-ordering during this lower demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 26-30) to reflect the recent mean of ~95, and continue using explicit L=3 to account for historical volatility and ensure enough coverage given the inconsistent delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: P24 order (245 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, joining the previously lost 529 units (total likely loss: 774 units). Sustained demand drop confirmed: P26-P30 average demand is 95.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a massive supply chain disruption and demand shock. Demand has significantly cooled from its peak (~195) to a new lower regime; the average of the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is 88.3 units. In terms of lead time, orders from P28 arrived with L=2, but a large portion of the pipeline remains compromised. Specifically, units from P15, P17, P18, P19 (529 units) and P24 (245 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost (total 774 lost). The current 'In-transit' of 965 units includes these 774 lost units, meaning the actionable pipeline is only 191 units. With 183 units on-hand and 191 units of valid in-transit, the total effective inventory is 374. Given the current demand mean of ~88 and L=2, a base stock of (1+L)*mu is approximately 264. Since effective inventory (374) exceeds this, no new orders are needed. Parameters L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=6 to reflect this new lower demand regime and the observed stability of L=2 for the most recent delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean: P26-P31 average is 88.3 (-55% from peak). Total likely lost shipments now include P24 (245 units) plus previous 529 units, totaling 774 lost units permanently occupying the 'In-transit' metric.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly stabilized at a lower level following the Period 16-25 peak. The average demand for the last seven periods (P26-P32) is approximately 90.3 units per period. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to reflect this current regime. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: we have 965 units in-transit, but based on past observations, 774 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P24) are confirmed or likely lost. This leaves an actionable pipeline of 191 units. On-hand inventory is 81 units, which covers nearly one period of current demand. Given the persistent risk of lost orders and lead time volatility (1-3 periods), I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to provide sufficient safety cover and maintain a higher base stock level, ensuring we don't stock out if recent arrivals face delays similar to historical patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower: P26-P32 average is 90.3 units/period (-54% from peak). Actionable pipeline reconciliation: Total units likely lost increased to 774 (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24), leaving only 191 units of reliable in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime following a significant peak period. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is 90.1 units, a sharp drop from the previous high-demand regime (~195 units). The system currently shows 965 units 'In-transit', but a massive reconciliation is required. Based on historical data, orders from P15 (133), P17 (71), P18 (176), P19 (149), and P24 (245) are effectively lost, totaling 774 units. This leaves an actionable pipeline of 191 units (calculated as 965 total in-transit - 774 lost). The on-hand inventory is currently 0. To meet the current regime's demand (approx. 90 units/period) across the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 4), we need roughly 360 units of total inventory coverage. With only 191 units in the reliable pipeline and 0 on hand, we are significantly under-covered. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflective of the new 90-unit mean and maintain L=3 explicitly to account for the observed volatility (1-3 periods) and prevent stockouts during the recovery phase, while ignoring the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline reconciliation: 774 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are confirmed lost and should be subtracted from 'In-transit' for order logic. Current demand regime stabilized at ~90 units/period (P26-P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the peak seen around Period 20. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has averaged 90.8 units, contrasting with the previous high-demand regime (~195). The supply chain remains unreliable. As of Period 35, the official 'In-transit' metric is 965 units, but history confirms a major systemic failure: orders from P15 (133), P17 (71), P18 (176), P19 (149), and P24 (245) have exceeded all reasonable lead times and are considered lost. These total 774 units. Therefore, the actionable pipeline inventory is 965 - 774 = 191 units (this likely includes the 324 from P28 which already arrived, or recent balances). Since on-hand is 0 and demand has dropped, I must use current demand statistics (N=9) to avoid over-ordering based on the old peak, while setting L=3 to protect against lead time variability (which has ranged from 1 to 3 periods). The OR backend will use these to target a safety stock appropriate for the new ~91 units/period mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~91 units/period since Period 26. Total confirmed lost units in transit: 774 (from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26, with an average of approximately 94 units per period (P26-P35: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53, 102, 88, 96, 135). The systemic supply failure continues to affect inventory metrics: 774 units from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 965. This leaves an actionable pipeline of 191 units (from the Period 28 order, though that already arrived in P30, implying those 191 units are actually from later orders P28-P35?). Re-evaluating: 'In-transit' is 965. Likely lost: P15(133)+P17(71)+P18(176)+P19(149)+P24(245) = 774. Remaining pipeline = 191. On-hand is 0. With total available (0 on-hand + 191 reliable pipeline) and demand at ~94/period, we are undersupplied for the next 3 periods (L=2 promised). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current lower demand regime and use the 'explicit' L=3 to account for the observed volatility and prevent stockouts while waiting for arrivals.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face a critical inventory situation with 0 on-hand units and a depleted actionable pipeline. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the Period 26 shift, with an average of approximately 94 units per period (P26-P36). Significant supply chain disruptions have occurred: 774 units from orders P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 are confirmed lost. Total reported In-transit is 965; subtracting the 774 lost units leaves an actionable pipeline of 191 units. However, there have been no arrivals since Period 30, and the last remaining potentially valid orders from the high-demand period (P20-P23) should have arrived by now based on the max observed lead time of 3. This suggests the reliability of the current pipeline is near zero. To restore inventory levels and meet the current demand regime of ~94 units/period, I am setting L=3 (the max observed functional lead time) to build a safety buffer against volatility and setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods (1+L) of the current demand regime (4 * 94 = 376). Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that refills the base stock while effectively ignoring the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~94 units/period (P26-P36 avg). Total confirmed lost/stranded units in transit: 774 (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24). Actionable pipeline effectively zero as no arrivals observed for 6 consecutive periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 94 units. Periods 26-37 show mean demand is significantly lower than the previous peak. The supply chain remains in a state of severe failure: 774 units from orders placed in P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24 are confirmed lost or stranded (no arrival in 13+ periods for the oldest). Subtracting these 774 lost units from the recorded 'In-transit' of 965 leaves an actionable pipeline of 191 units. However, we haven't seen an arrival for 7 consecutive periods (since P30). The current on-hand inventory is 0. To restore service level against the current demand of ~94 units/period and accounting for high lead time volatility/loss risk, I will set L to 3 and re-forecast demand using recent_N=10 to capture the current stable regime. The goal is to trigger a replenishment order that overcomes the 'lost' units inflating the internal pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed: 774 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24) are permanently lost; only 191 units of the 965 in-transit are potentially valid. Demand is stable at ~94 units/period since P26.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following a peak; the average demand from Period 26 to Period 38 is approximately 100 units per period. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. While 'In-transit' shows 965 units, historical data confirms that 774 units are permanently lost (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). The remaining 191 units are also severely overdue (last arrival was P30), making the 'actionable' pipeline zero. With zero inventory on-hand and no dependable arrivals, a new order is necessary. To handle the high lead time variance and high risk of loss, L is set to 3. \u03bc\u0302 is set to (1+3) * 105 = 420 to cover the forecast mean plus a safety buffer for the 100-unit/period demand. sigma_hat is set explicitly to a higher value (120) to account for the extreme volatility in arrival reliability and the resulting service level risk.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed at 0: the 965 units 'In-transit' consist of 774 units confirmed lost and 191 units that are severely overdue (>8 periods). Demand regime stabilized around 100 units/period (P26-P38).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the Period 16-25 peak. Since Period 26, demand has averaged 96.6 units per period (P26-P39), a significant drop from the previous ~195 units/period. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0. Although the 'In-transit' metric shows 965 units, historical reconciliation confirms that 774 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24) are permanently lost. The remaining 191 units in the pipeline are now over 10 periods old, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, and are also considered lost. Consequently, the actionable pipeline is effectively 0. To restart supply and meet the stabilized demand of ~100 units/period, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for historical volatility and an explicit mu_hat based on the current regime (100 units/period * (L+1)) to ensure sufficient stock-up while managing holding costs. An explicit sigma_hat is used to maintain service levels amidst supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed at 0: all 965 units currently 'In-transit' are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (exceeding 10+ periods lead time). Demand regime has been stable at approximately 97 units/period for the last 14 periods (P26-P39).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 965 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are permanently lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, 529 units from P15/P17/P18/P19 and 245 units from P24 are well beyond the maximum observed 3-period lead time. No arrivals have occurred since Period 30. The actionable pipeline is effectively 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 97 units per period (P26-P40). To resume service and counter the 0 on-hand inventory, I will set L to an explicit value of 3 (the observed maximum functional lead time) to ensure the base stock covers a 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set to 388 (4 periods * 97 avg demand) and sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle current demand volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place a new order despite the phantom 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline confirmed at 0: all 965 units currently 'In-transit' (from P15-P28) are lost or indefinitely delayed (12-25 periods old). Demand regime remains stable at ~97 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 26, following a significant peak between Periods 16-25. The average demand over the last 16 periods (P26-P41) is approximately 95 units. The supply chain remains severely compromised; the current 'In-transit' balance of 965 units consists entirely of orders placed between Period 15 and Period 24 that are now 17-26 periods overdue. Since the maximum historical lead time for a successful delivery was 3 periods, these units are confirmed lost or permanently stranded. Consequently, the actionable pipeline is 0, and the current on-hand inventory is 0. To resume service and meet current demand, I am setting L=3 (to account for historical lead-time variance and avoid stockouts), mu_hat based on the most recent 10 periods to capture the current stable regime (avg ~96), and sigma_hat based on the same period to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline remains 0 as all 965 units in-transit (orders P15-P24) are confirmed lost (>17 periods overdue). Demand regime is stable at ~95 units/period (P26-P41).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe supply chain failure state. All 965 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are from orders placed between Periods 15 and 28 (14 to 27 periods ago), far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. These units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed and no longer represent actionable inventory. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 26, with an average of approximately 97 units per period. However, without any arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (since P30) despite a massive theoretical pipeline, placing new orders is likely futile and only incurs potential risk if the bottleneck is systemic. However, since the goal is to maximize reward and we have 0 on-hand inventory, I will set parameters to target the current demand regime (~100 units/period) while using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the high historical variance, effectively signaling the backend to attempt procurement despite the stalled pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged supply chain failure. All 965 units 'In-transit' are from orders placed between Period 15 and Period 28 (at least 15 periods ago). Given that the maximum observed lead time for successful deliveries was 3 periods, these units are confirmed lost or indefinitely stranded. No arrivals have occurred since Period 30. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from Period 26 to Period 43 is approximately 96 units/period. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 'In-transit' figure (965) from the base stock calculation, and as long as that 965 remains in the pipeline, the backend will never place a new order (since 965 > base stock for any reasonable forecast). To force the backend to place an order and resume sales, I must use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 965-unit 'ghost' pipeline. My target base stock is (L+1) * 96 \u2248 384. To force an order of ~384 units when the system thinks it has 965 in-transit, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1350 units. This allows the system to bridge the gap and start restocking.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline remains 0: all 965 units currently 'In-transit' (from P15-P28) are lost or indefinitely delayed (>15 periods old). Demand regime is stable at ~96 units/period (P26-P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a mean of approximately 96 units/period (average of P26-P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' metric of 1345 units is misleading because 965 units (orders from P15-P28) are confirmed lost, as their age exceeds 15+ periods (max lead time observed was 3). The only potentially active shipment is the order of 380 units placed in Period 44. Since the promised lead time is 2, this Period 44 order is expected to arrive during Period 46 (viewable at Period 47). I will maintain the lead time parameter at L=3 to account for historical volatility and provide a safety buffer. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 96 units) while filtering out the high-demand peak from Periods 16-25. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand until the Period 44 order arrives, while potentially placing a supplemental order if the net-inventory (adjusted for losses) falls below the calculated target.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at a lower mean of approximately 105 units/period over the most recent 20 periods (P26-P45). The massive 'In-transit' figure of 1,345 units is misleading because at least 965 units (orders from P15 to P28) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, having exceeded any reasonable lead time (17-30+ periods). The order placed in P44 (380 units) is the only active part of the pipeline. Since Period 46 is nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50) and lead times have historically ranged from 1-3 periods, the P44 order is expected to arrive between P45 and P47. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and P44's order of 380 units covers roughly 3.6 periods of demand (380 / 105), no new order is necessary this period to avoid excessive holding costs at the game's conclusion. I maintain the lead time at 3 to account for the upper end of the observed arrival window for successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline reconciliation: 965 units (orders P15-P28) are confirmed lost. Only the P44 order (380 units) is considered active. Demand regime is stable at ~105 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower mean of approximately 105 units/period since Period 26 (P26-P46 avg: 101). The most recent demand (P46) was 71. We have a significant supply chain issue: out of 1345 units 'In-transit', 965 units (orders P15-P28) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (>18 periods overdue). The only viable order in the pipeline is from Period 44 (380 units), which is within the observed lead time window (promised 2, max observed 3). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high chance of a stockout if P44 is delayed or lost, I am setting L=3 to account for historical volatility and using recent_N (N=20) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the post-spike demand level. By assuming only the P44 order is 'real', the OR backend will calculate a base stock around (1+3)*105 = 420. Since it sees 'In-transit' as 1345, it would normally order 0. To force an order, I would need to use explicit values, but the engine is capped. However, given we have 3 periods left and a massive (mostly phantom) pipeline, the best move is to let the OR engine calculate based on the most realistic demand window.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline reconciliation: 965 units (orders P15-P28) are confirmed lost; in-transit units from these periods should be ignored. Demand regime is stable at ~101 units/period since Period 26.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are managing chips(Regular) as the game nears its end (Period 50). The supply chain remains dysfunctional: although the 'In-transit' metric shows 1345 units, historical analysis confirms that orders from P15 to P28 (totaling 965 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed (>20 periods). The only potentially viable order is from P44 (380 units), which is now 4 periods old (beyond the nominal lead time of 2, but within the observed window of 3). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 101 units per period (P26-P47). To ensure we capture remaining sales for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50) while respecting the OR backend's order caps and accounting for the zero actionable on-hand inventory, I will keep L at 3 (reflecting the realistic delay) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable demand regime (N=22, covering P26 thru P47). This approach will signal a need for stock to cover the final periods without being misled by the ghost 'In-transit' inventory.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 100 units/period since Period 26 (P26-P48 average is ~99 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' metric shows 1345 units, but history confirms that 965 of these (from orders P15-P28) are permanently lost or indefinitely delayed (over 20+ periods overdue). Only the order placed in P44 (380 units) is potentially active. Since the promised lead time is 2, and the order from P44 has not arrived by the start of P49 (it would have concluded in P45-P47 if lead time was 1-3), the actionable pipeline is effectively zero or unreliable. To ensure the backend places an order to meet the current demand regime (mu ~100) and covers the lead time risk, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the maximum observed successful lead time) and use recent_20 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand level while excluding the massive peak from P16-P25. Sigma_hat is set to recent_20 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline remains 0: all 1345 units currently 'In-transit' are likely lost; 965 units (P15-P28) are >20 periods overdue, and 380 units (P44) are >4 periods overdue. Current demand regime stable at 99 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, inventory remains at 0 with a total 'In-transit' of 1345 units. Analysis of order history confirms that 965 of these units (from orders P15 through P28) are between 22 and 35 periods overdue and are definitively lost. The remaining 380 units from Period 44 are now 6 periods overdue, exceeding the maximum observed successful lead time of 3 periods, suggesting they are also likely lost or severely delayed. Demand has been stable since Period 26, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods average = 100.2). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is effectively unreliable, I must set the OR parameters to trigger a replenishment order. I am setting L=3 to account for the historical lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and mu_hat to (1+L)*100 = 400 to cover demand through the review and lead period. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand standard deviation to manage service levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 1345 is treated as zero actionable pipeline in my logic due to the massive delays.

Carry-over insight: Actionable pipeline reconciliation: 1345 units (all current in-transit orders P15-P44) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as of Period 50. Effective lead time for successful orders is 1-3 periods, but systemic loss rate is extremely high.
