Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The history shows historical demand samples from 5 periods (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), which have a mean of 114.4 and a standard deviation of 15.2. Since this is the first decision period and no conclusive lead-time evidence exists beyond the promised L=2, I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to leverage the provided historical samples for setting the base stock. The (L+1) factor (total 3 periods of risk) is appropriate for a 2-period lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. Looking at 'Period 1 conclude', demand was 46 units, but since arrivals happen after the decision phase and on-hand was 0, sales were 0. The inventory remains 0 until the Period 1 order arrives (expected during Period 3's arrival phase, visible in Period 4). Historical demand data provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggests an average demand of approximately 114.4 per period. However, the observed demand in Period 1 was significantly lower at 46. Given only one observation of actual gameplay demand, I will rely on the provided historical samples for the forecast. I use default settings which allow the OR backend to use all available historical data (5 samples + Period 1) to determine the base stock. The current in-transit (141) is roughly 1.2x the average demand, which is a reasonable starting point for a lead time of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (141 units) and P2 (155 units) are currently in-transit and totaling 296 units. According to the strict execution sequence, the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (P+L, 1+2=3). Confirmation of this arrival will not be visible until the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. The historical demand for this SKU (chips(Regular)) across P1-P5 (provided in the prompt context) shows a mean demand of approximately 114.6 (131, 92, 118, 125, 106). Since we are only at Period 3 in the live game, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the available historical samples (131 and 92 from conclude messages plus any internal data seeds) to estimate demand and keep L at the promised value of 2.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No orders have arrived yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible in Period 4's conclusion). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 366 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable across the first three periods (46, 131, 87). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the average demand seen so far (approx 88 per period). Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (promised = 2). The OR backend calculation of (1+L)*mean will set a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (approx 264 units). Since 366 are in transit, the order quantity will likely be capped or zero, allowing the pipeline to flush into on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time is volatile. Order 1 (placed P1) arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), while Order 3 (placed P3) also arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 81 units on hand and 155 units in transit (ordered in P2). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows values: 46 (P1 demand was 131 in samples, but history says 46, let's look at samples: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. Wait, the history says P1 demand=46, P2 demand=131, P3 demand=87, P4 demand=130 - these differ slightly from the provided samples. I will use the actual history: 46, 131, 87, 130. Average demand is ~98.5). Since the lead time has varied between 1 and 3 periods, setting L=2 (default) is reasonable as an average, but I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed dynamics. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the specific demand trend from the history which shows a jump from P1(46) to a higher level in P2-P4.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 46 (P1), 131 (P2), 87 (P3), 130 (P4), and 105 (P5). The mean demand is approximately 100 units per period. Regarding lead times: the P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), and the P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (155 units) is currently overdue as of P5 conclude, as the promised lead time is 2. However, it remains in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To ensure we recover from the stockout in P5, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (avg=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 available samples (recent_N with N=5) to capture the current demand distribution, as no clear seasonal trend or regime shift is yet confirmed.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, demand samples are [46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171]. Note: Period 1 demand was provided as 131 in the prompt but recorded as 46 in the history conclude; I will use the history conclude values for statistical calculations. The average demand over 6 periods is ~111.7. Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), Period 3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is 2. Currently, inventory is 0 and 459 units are in transit (orders from P2, P5, and P6). The stockout in P6 (demand 171) highlights the need to account for demand volatility. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed shifts (3 and 1), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the recent upward trend in volatility and volume (especially the 171 peak).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 553 units in-transit. Historical lead times have shown significant variability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The order from P2 (ordered 155 units) is now at lead_time 6 and hasn't arrived, suggesting it might be lost or severely delayed. Recent demand (P1-P7) averages ~109 units (Sample data provided: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106; Concluded data: 46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, 93). Current in-transit (553) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead period (L+1=3). Specifically, 553 units cover about 5 periods of average demand. However, the OR backend's capped policy and base stock calculation need correct parameters to account for the erratic arrivals. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 7 concluded samples to capture the variance caused by the stockouts resulting from lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed 1-period and 3-period arrivals despite promised 2-period lead time. Possible lost shipment: Period 2 order (155 units) has not arrived after 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead-time instability and evidence of lost shipments. Promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have occurred at 1 and 3 periods. Most critically, the Period 2 order (155 units) is now 7 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it is likely lost. The Period 6 order (138 units) is also overdue (promised at P8). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed upper bound of lead-time variability, which increases the pipeline coverage requirement. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~111 units (excluding Period 1 data which seems erratic). I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. Setting L to 3 (explicit) will force the OR engine to recalculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, helping to buffer against the gaps left by lost or delayed shipments and ensuring on-hand levels are sufficient for the next several cycles.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment risk: P2 order (155 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods. Actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting high variability and unreliable 2-period promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 105 units (based on recent periods and the provided 5-period seed data). Our carry-over insights highlight a critical issue: lead time is highly variable (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and shipments can be lost (Period 2 order). Current on-hand inventory is 75, with 336 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 8, and 9). The Period 6 order (138 units) is currently at L=4 and has not arrived; if it follows the pattern of the lost Period 2 order, our pipeline might be overinflated. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and to increase the base stock safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while acknowledging the high volatility caused by stockouts and lead time swings.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Potential lost shipment risk for Period 6 order (138 units) as it exceeds the longest observed lead time of 3 periods without concluding.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 with a high risk of stockouts. History analysis shows significant supply chain unreliability: the promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual arrivals occur at either 1 or 3 periods (Average ~2). Crucially, multiple shipments appear lost: the P2 order (155 units) is now 9 periods overdue, and the P6 order (138 units) is 5 periods overdue. The in-transit total of 403 units includes these 293 likely-lost units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 110 units (P9 and P10 orders). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the slower delivery mode and adjust mu_hat. Demand is stable (Mean ~110 over last 5 periods). By setting a higher L, the base stock targets a higher safety level to cover for the lost units and unreliable delivery speed.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (138 units) is now confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed, exceeding max observed 3-period lead time). Active pipeline is significantly lower than reported 'In-transit' value.

We are currently at Period 12. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 496 units is misleading due to lost shipments. Specifically, the P2 order (155 units) and the P6 order (138 units) are confirmed lost based on our carry-over insights (exceeding the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods). The effective pipeline consists of orders from P9 (43), P10 (67), and P11 (93), totaling 203 units. Total demand samples are N=11 (excluding P12), with a mean of ~102 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, making the promised L=2 unreliable. Given our current stockout (on-hand=0) and the high probability of delivery delays, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime (~92.8 units/period), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the moderate volatility observed.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the chip inventory is low (17 units). A critical analysis of the pipeline shows that the 'In-transit' figure of 386 is misleading due to lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (155 units) and P6 (138 units) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. The actual functional pipeline consists only of the P11 order (93 units). Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods, suggesting a mean lead time slightly higher than the promised 2 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to capture this empirical average (currently approx 2.2). Demand remains stable with no clear seasonal shifts (mean ~101). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to compensate for the 'phantom' inventory (the 293 lost units it incorrectly thinks are coming), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + lost_inventory, which is (1+2.2)*101 + 293 \u2248 616. This forces the inventory position high enough to trigger an order that fills the gap left by the lost shipments. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation to maintain a standard safety stock level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after failing to meet demand in Period 13. The 'In-transit' figure (586) is highly inflated due to lost shipments from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (138 units). Subtracting these 293 lost units leaves a realistic pipeline of 293 units (from Period 11 and 13). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of 2.17 for successful deliveries. To combat the stockout and the unreliability of the 'In-transit' data, I am setting L to 2 (promised). For demand (mu_hat), since recent demand (Periods 9-13: 100, 97, 81, 93, 125) averages ~99 units, I will use a conservative recent_N of 5. This results in a mu_hat of ~297 (3 periods of demand). Given the stockout and the OR backend's use of 'In-transit' (586), which it currently believes is full, it may not trigger a large enough order. However, by maintaining reasonable L and mu_hat parameters based on actual demand, we aim to stabilize the replenishment cycle as soon as valid orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation: 293 units (P2 and P6 orders) are confirmed lost and persistently inflate the system's pipeline inventory view.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports 493 units in-transit. However, based on carry-over insights, 293 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, meaning the viable pipeline is actually 200 units (ordered in P13). Historical demand for the last 14 periods averages ~102 units, but recent demand is slightly more volatile. The observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 2, or 3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (493) from its base_stock calculation, it will likely order nothing. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming lead time (L+1), I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (~306 units) plus the lost inventory offset of 293 units, totaling 599. This compensates for the backend's inflated view of the pipeline while targeting a stock level that accounts for the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 16, we start with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 637 units in-transit. However, historical analysis proves that orders from Period 2 (155 units) and Period 6 (138 units) are lost, totaling 293 ghost units. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 637 - 293 = 344 units (consisting of orders from P13 and P15). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed arrivals. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 106 across the last 15 periods, but with recent demand spikes (P13-P15), a recent window (N=5) better captures the current trend (avg ~105-110). To compensate for the 293 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Units. With L=2 and mean=110, mu_hat = (110 * 3) + 293 = 623. This ensures the OR backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $620.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 36. The system reports 455 units in transit, but historical analysis confirms that 293 units are permanently lost (Period 2 order of 155 units and Period 6 order of 138 units). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 162 units (455 - 293). Lead times have been volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of roughly 2.5 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3). Demand has remained relatively stable but slightly elevated in the most recent periods (P13-P16 avg: 130). To compensate for the 293 unit 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include a one-time replenishment buffer. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time of ~2.4 periods rather than the promised 2. mu_hat target = (1+L)*E[D] + lost_units. With L=2.4 and E[D]=110, target is ~374 + 293 = 667.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend recently, with Period 16 and 17 recording 164 and 194 units respectively, compared to the initial average around 110. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift while maintaining some stability. The lead time remains highly variable (observed 1, 2, and 3 periods). The 'In-transit' total of 651 is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (155) and Period 6 (138), totaling 293 units. Additionally, the order from Period 15 (144 units) has not arrived after 2 periods, which is within the observed 3-period max lead time but contributes to the current stockout. To compensate for the 293 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and recent avg demand \u2248 140, base mu_hat is 420. Adding the 293 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 713. This ensures the backend places a meaningful order despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Inflation of in-transit inventory remains at 293 units due to lost orders (P2, P6). Period 15 order (144 units) is still within the 3-period arrival window. Recent demand (P16-17) indicates a higher mean (avg ~179) compared to historical baseline (~110).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand surge. Recent demand (P16-P18) has averaged 180 units/period, compared to the historical average of ~115. We must forecast using this higher regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 773 is severely inflated by lost orders (P2: 155, P6: 138) and the yet-to-arrive Period 15 order (144 units), which is now 4 periods old and likely lost given the maximum observed lead time is 3. Total ghost inventory is approximately 437 units (155+138+144). Effective pipeline is closer to 336 (P17: 214, P18: 122). To compensate for the OR backend's inability to see 'lost' orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) periods of demand (L=2 promised + 1 review = 3) at the new mean of 180, plus a buffer for the lost P15 order to trigger a replacement. Target mu_hat = (3 * 180) + 144 = 684. Sigma is adjusted via recent_N to reflect higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Period 15 order (144 units) confirmed lost (exceeded max 3-period lead time). Total lost inventory currently inflating In-transit: 437 units (P2, P6, P15). Sustained high demand regime confirmed (P16-P18 avg: 180).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (Periods 16-19 avg: 184.75 units) compared to the initial baseline (~110 units). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 773 units is severely misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (155), Period 6 (138), and Period 15 (144), totaling 437 phantom units. The true pipeline consists of orders from Period 17 (214) and Period 18 (122), totaling 336 units. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a deduction (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'offset' the 437 units that don't exist, effectively tricking the system into placing an order. I estimate the base stock needed for a 3-period lead time (observed max) at the current demand level: (1+3) * 185 = 740 units. Adding the 437 lost units to this to negate the backend's subtraction leads to a mu_hat target of ~1177. Using L=3 explicitly based on historical max observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: P15 order (144 units) confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' is now 437 units (P2, P6, P15). Demand mean shifted from ~110 to ~185 (+68%) starting around Period 16.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system faces a critical inventory shortage with 0 units on-hand and high demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1093 is heavily inflated by 437 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2: 155, P6: 138, P15: 144) and potentially more, as the Period 17 order (214 units) and Period 18 order (122 units) have exceeded the promised 2-period lead time. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; anything exceeding 3 periods is likely lost. Demand has shifted into a high-growth regime (Period 16-20 avg ~186), a 69% increase from the initial baseline (~110). To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory that prevents the OR backend from ordering enough, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus an 'adjustment' that offsets the 437 lost units (Current L=2, so mu_hat target = 186 * 3 + 437 \u2248 995). I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time which has been trending higher than 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: P17 (214 units) and P18 (122 units) are now overdue (exceeded 3-period max observation), increasing possible lost inventory from 437 to 773 units. Total In-transit is highly unreliable.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and rising historical demand. As of Period 22, demand has shifted to a high regime averaging approximately 192 units over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), compared to the baseline of ~110. The 'In-transit' balance of 1093 units is massively inflated by lost or significantly delayed orders. Specifically, orders from P2 (155), P6 (138), P15 (144), P17 (214), and P18 (122) have all exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, totaling 773 units of 'phantom' inventory. This leaves a real pipeline of only 320 units (from P20). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline (since final order = base_stock - pipeline), I am using the 'explicit' method. For \u03bc\u0302, I am targeting a base stock that covers the 2-period promised lead time plus the current period (L+1=3) at the new demand mean (~192 * 3 = 576), plus an additional 773 units to offset the phantom inventory being subtracted by the backend. Total \u03bc\u0302 = 576 + 773 = 1349. This ensures the engine places an order that accounts for both the demand shift and the systemic shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline inflation confirmed: Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' reached 773 units by Period 22 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime mean is ~192 (P16-P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by extreme shipment unreliability and high pipeline inflation. As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0 and the official 'In-transit' is 1381 units. However, based on the history of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18), approximately 773 units in that pipeline are 'phantom' and will never arrive. The orders placed in Period 20 (320 units) and Period 22 (288 units) are still within the potential arrival window but have not yet 'concluded'. Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a higher mean (avg ~187). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I've set L=2 (promised), but I am setting mu_hat to a significantly higher value that targets a base stock of roughly 900-1000 units. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and current reported pipeline is 1381, mu_hat must be high enough so that (mu_hat + safety_stock) - 1381 > 0 to trigger any order. Given the critical stockout since Period 18 and recent demand averaging ~190, I will forecast mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) at the high regime plus a buffer to overcome the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed extreme pipeline inflation. Expected 'real' pipeline is 608 (P20, P22) vs reported 1381. 773 units are confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Demand mean remains high (~190).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we must address extreme pipeline inflation while maintaining inventory for a high-demand regime. Current 'In-transit' is 1019 units, but historical evidence confirms significant losses: P2 (155), P6 (138), P15 (144), P17 (214), and P18 (122), totaling 773 units of 'phantom' inventory. The reliable pipeline consists only of orders from P22 (arrived) and P23 (246 units). Since the OR backend subtracts full 'In-transit' from its base stock calculation, we must use 'explicit' methods to override this and ensure replenishment. Demand shifted from a mean of ~110 to ~190 (+72%) starting at P16. Recent demand (P23) was 247, the highest yet recorded. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat=1140 (approx 190 * (2+1) * 2 to compensate for the 773 phantom units), and sigma_hat=150 to ensure the backend places an order that ignores the dead 'In-transit' stock and maintains a safety buffer for the high variance and demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' has reached 773 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime mean is established at ~190 units (P16-P23). Actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the 'In-transit' figure of 1019 units is severely inflated. Historical analysis confirms multiple lost shipments: P2 (155), P6 (138), P15 (144), P17 (214), and P18 (122), totaling 773 units of 'phantom inventory'. The true active pipeline consists of orders from P23 (246 units) and the unsampled P24 (0 units), for a realistic pipeline of 246. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting around P16, with an average of approximately 190.4 units (P16-P24). Lead times are erratic, effectively ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 1019 units, I must use 'explicit' values. I set L=3 to account for the maximum observed arrival window. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 190.4 \u2248 762. Adding a safety buffer for the high variance (std dev approx 30), I use sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * 30 * 1.5 \u2248 90. Because the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and it uses the 'In-transit' field (1019) for pipeline, I must set the mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger a replenishment despite the 773 phantom units. Target base stock should be ~900 to ensure we cover demand during the 3-period lead time while subtracting the 1019 'In-transit'. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to force the backend to place a substantial order to keep up with the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory remains 773 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand regime mean is established at ~190 units (P16-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the 'In-transit' count is 835 units. However, based on the history of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18), 773 of these units are confirmed or highly probable phantom inventory. The 'true' pipeline inventory is only 62 units (ordered Period 25). The demand regime has shifted significantly since P16, with a mean demand of approximately 192 units (avg P16-P25). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this higher demand despite the phantom In-transit inflation, I am menggunakan an 'explicit' L to reflect the volatile actual lead time (ranging 1-3 periods) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Forecast_Mean = (1+2.5) * 192 \u2248 672. I use L=2.5 to buffer against the frequent 3-period lead times while reflecting the average. sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high demand volatility (range 163-247) and lead time uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a structural demand shift and severe pipeline unreliability. Demand since Period 16 has averaged ~190 units (compared to ~110 initially), though Period 26 saw a dip to 110. Real 'In-transit' inventory is significantly lower than the reported 835 units due to 773 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline is only 62 units (the P25 order). The current on-hand inventory is 117. With a lead time varying between 1 and 3 periods, we must set parameters that force the OR backend to order, despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. By setting an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1050 ((L+1) * 262.5), we compensate for the 773 phantom units. This effectively signals to the backend that we need a base stock high enough to trigger an order to cover the current demand regime and account for the pipeline gap. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent higher-volatility demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Effective pipeline is actually 62 units. The 'In-transit' value of 835 remains inflated by 773 units of lost stock (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Current demand mean remains ~190, though P26 showed volatility (110). Parameters are adjusted explicitly to bypass phantom inventory calculation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we face zero on-hand inventory and a demand regime that averaged ~190 units (P16-P25), although the last two periods (P26-P27) saw a dip to ~117. The 'In-transit' figure of 997 is heavily inflated by 773 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). The 'effective' pipeline includes ONLY the orders from P25 (62 units) and P27 (162 units), totaling 224 units. To bypass OR backend logic subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit value, I set mu_hat explicitly to the desired base stock. Target base stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + safety stock. With L=2, and expected demand ~160 (blending recent dip with the high regime), base stock should be roughly 3 * 160 + safety stock \u2248 600. To force an order that covers demand while correcting for the 773 lost units, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 1373 (600 base stock + 773 lost units).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Effective pipeline is 224 units (P25, P27). The system 'In-transit' of 997 remains inflated by 773 lost units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Explicit parameters are required to offset this loss and maintain stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1432 units and 0 On-hand inventory. Based on the history, 773 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Furthermore, orders from P20, P22, P23, and P25 have already arrived. This leaves only the orders from P27 (162 units) and P28 (435 units) as valid future arrivals, totaling 597 'real' pipeline units. The reported 1432 is inflated by 835 units (773 lost + 62 from P25 which arrived but seems stuck in the count/resolving). Demand recently showed a dip (Period 26-28), but prior to that, the mean was ~190. I will adopt a slightly more conservative demand mean of ~150 to bridge the gap between the high regime and the recent lows. To bypass the backend's flawed 'pipeline inventory' calculation (which uses the inflated 1432), I use the 'explicit' method. To target an arrival that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at 150/period (450 total), while accounting for the 597 units already coming, I must set mu_hat high enough that 'mu_hat - inflated_pipeline' results in a meaningful replenishment. However, a simpler way to force the system to order is to set mu_hat to a value that offsets the phantom inventory: Target (450) + Phantom (835) = 1285. This ensures the OR logic doesn't stop ordering due to imaginary stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Valid pipeline inventory is 597 units (P27, P28). The 'In-transit' of 1432 is inflated by 835 phantom units (773 confirmed lost + 62 units from P25). Recent demand (P26-28) shifted lower (avg 106) compared to the P16-P25 regime (avg 190).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1,270 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms extreme pipeline inflation due to lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). The actual valid pipeline consists only of the P28 order (435 units). Total confirmed/highly probable lost units = 1270 - 435 = 835 units. Demand has clearly shifted: the high-demand regime (P16-P25 avg ~190) has given way to a lower-demand regime (P26-P29 avg ~97). For Period 30, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to avoid over-ordering during this apparent downturn. Lead time remains variable between 1-3 periods, so L=2 (default) is maintained. To bypass the 'In-transit' inflation in the OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], I set mu_hat explicitly high. This ensures the base_stock (calculated as 604 based on the recent demand mean of ~97 at L=2 and target service level) overcomes the phantom inventory subtraction and the cap, allowing a necessary replenishment order to trigger.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean decreased from ~190 to ~97 (-49%). Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' view is now 835 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower demand regime (starting Period 26) with an average demand of approximately 95 units (P26-P30: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88). The 'In-transit' figure of 1010 units is heavily inflated by 835 units of confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). Subtracting these lost units from the reported In-transit gives an effective pipeline of 175 units (exclusively the P30 order). With On-hand inventory at 438 units, our effective inventory position is 613 units. This is very high relative to the current demand regime (~95 units/period), covering over 6 periods of supply. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce ordering to prevent overstocking, but to ensure the base stock calculation doesn't over-react to the phantom pipeline and to align with the current lower demand, I am using explicit parameters. L is set to 2 (promised). Mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of recent 5 samples (3 * 95.4 = 286). Sigma_hat is set to sqrt(3) * std of recent 5 samples (~37). This informs the backend of the lower demand environment while the excess on-hand stock is absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean settled at ~95 units (P26-P30). Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' is 835 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-173.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted to a lower mean since Period 26, averaging approximately 85 units per period over the last 6 observations (110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53). Previous high demand of ~190 is no longer present. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 1010 units remains heavily inflated by 835 phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). The actual valid pipeline is 175 units (from P30). The current on-hand inventory is 385 units. Given the new demand mean (~85) and current stock levels (on-hand + valid pipeline = 560), the stock is sufficient to cover approximately 6+ periods of demand, which exceeds the L+1 window. However, to ensure the OR backend does not stop ordering entirely due to the inflated 1010 'In-transit' value, I am providing explicit parameters. Using L=2, mu_hat=255 (3 * 85), and sigma_hat=35 (sqrt(3) * ~20) to reflect the new lower demand regime and ensure the system maintains a target base stock of approximately 300-350 units. Since 560 (real inventory) > 350 (target), the order will appropriately be zero or minimal this period, preventing further overstocking while training the backend to ignore the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~85 units (P26-P31), confirming a -55% shift from the previous regime. Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains constant at 835 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~85 units since Period 26, significantly lower than the previous high-demand period. Current on-hand inventory is 283 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1010 units is heavily inflated by 835 units of historical phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). This leaves a real pipeline of 175 units (from P30). The total real inventory (on-hand 283 + real pipeline 175) is 458 units. At a demand of ~85 units/period, this covers roughly 5.4 periods, which is more than the maximum observed lead time + review period (3+1=4). Therefore, no new order is required. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously suppressing orders in the future due to the 835 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*85 = 255. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L)*25 = 43.3 (using a standard deviation of ~25 observed in the recent regime). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 90 units (P26-P33 mean: 91). Currently, the 'In-transit' figure (1010) is heavily inflated by 835 units of confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). The actual 'real' pipeline inventory is 175 units (the order from P30). With on-hand inventory at 195 units and the expected arrival of 175 units (P30 order), the effective inventory covers the next several periods of the current low-demand regime (~90 units/period). To prevent the OR backend from erroneously stopping orders due to the 835 units of phantom inventory, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=2 (consistent with promised lead time and recent arrivals) and mu_hat = 270 (3 periods * 90 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to 40 based on the recent volatility of the new regime. This ensures a base stock level of approximately 315 units, which allows the OR engine to order once the effective inventory (on-hand + real pipeline) drops below that threshold, despite the phantom In-transit inflation.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P33) mean confirmed at ~90 units/period. Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' remains 835 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 35 is stable, originating from the shift around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 91 units. Current on-hand inventory is 99 units. Total 'In-transit' as reported by the system is 1010 units; however, historical analysis confirms that 835 units of this are phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). The actual active pipeline consists only of the order from Period 30 (175 units), which is now overdue (4 periods since ordering, max observed lead time is 3). Given the high loss rate and the fact that on-hand inventory (99) is nearly equal to one period of demand (~91), I will use 'explicit' parameters to force an order. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (1010) from the base_stock, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the phantom inventory + desired stock. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Using L=2, mean=91, and a high service level, target is ~350 units. To overcome the 1010 'In-transit', I set mu_hat explicitly to 1400. This ensures the backend calculates (1400 - 1010) = 390, which results in a net order to replenish the lost units and cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 835 units. Order from Period 30 (175 units) is now 4 periods old, exceeding the max observed lead time of 3, potentially lost. Demand remains stable in the ~90 range.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has exceeded available stock. The reported 'In-transit' of 1332 units is heavily inflated by known lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25), totaling 835 units. Additionally, the P30 order (175 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P30, now P36) and is confirmed as a new lost shipment. Total phantom inventory is now 1010 units (835 + 175). The true pipeline consists only of the P35 order (322 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to phantom stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The demand regime (P26-P35) averages 97 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. For a Lead Time (L) of 2, the target base stock (assuming a 0.8 service level for chips) should be approximately 3.5 periods of demand (L+1 + buffer). I set mu_hat to 1010 (phantom stock) + 350 (required base stock) = 1360. This 'fools' the logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) into ordering the necessary units. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx sqrt(3)*25) using recent data.

Carry-over insight: P30 order (175 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' view is now 1010 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). Demand regime (P26-P35) mean remains stable at ~97 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from Period 26, with an average of approximately 95 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this specific regime (Periods 26-36). The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1396 units is severely inflated. Based on the history, 1010 units are definitely or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). The true pipeline consists only of the orders from P35 (322 units) and P36 (64 units), totaling 386 units. With on-hand inventory at 0, the total reliable inventory position is 386 units. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly zeroing out orders due to the 1010 lost ('phantom') units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at ~95 units/period plus a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 1300 creates a base stock approximately equal to (Current System In-transit + Desired On-hand), effectively instructing the system to order what is missing without being blinded by the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' view is confirmed at 1010 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30) as of Period 37.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 93 units and a standard deviation of 22. In-transit inventory remains significantly inflated by 1,010 units of confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). The current on-hand inventory is 286 units. Based on a 2-period promised lead time (L=2) and the current mean, the required base stock to cover demand until the next delivery (L+1 = 3 periods) is approximately 279 units (plus safety stock). Since current on-hand (286) already exceeds this, and we have no valid shipments currently in the pipeline (actual pipeline is 0 units), the OR engine would naturally order 0 if it were not for the phantom inventory. I am using 'explicit' parameters to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current demand regime and account for the fact that the 'In-transit' it sees is entirely composed of lost stock. No new order is needed this period as on-hand stock is sufficient for the immediate three periods of demand (~280 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a mean of approximately 95 units per period (P26-P38 average is ~99, but median is lower). The system 'In-transit' figure of 1010 units is entirely composed of phantom inventory (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, and P30). With 156 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0 (no outstanding orders from P37 or P38), we need to maintain stock against a base demand of ~95. Since Profit ($4) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1), the target critical fractile is 0.8. Using explicit parameters: \u03bc\u0302 is set to 285 (3 periods * 95) to cover lead time (L=2) + current period, and \u03c3\u0302 is set to 50 to allow for moderate volatility around the mean. This bypasses the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' value which would otherwise prevent ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' remains 1010 units. Current demand regime (P26-P38) mean is ~99 units/period. Effective pipeline inventory is currently 0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 40. Demand remains in the stable lower regime that began around Period 26, with a mean of approximately 99 units and moderate standard deviation. On-hand inventory is 89 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1010 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30), as no orders were placed in Periods 37-39. This means the actual pipeline inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting this phantom inventory from the target base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3), and then manually adding the phantom inventory amount (1010), I ensure the backend generates an order that maintains the necessary stock level. I estimate the base stock target should be around 380 units (3 * 100 mean + safety stock). Adding 1010 results in an explicit mu_hat of 1390. This bypasses the logic where the system sees 1010 in transit and stops ordering.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system reports an In-transit inventory of 1339 units. Based on historical tracking, 1010 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30) are confirmed lost, as their ages far exceed the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The 'real' pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 40 order (329 units). The current demand regime (since Period 26) is stable, with a mean of approximately 95 units per period. Since On-hand is 0, the total available inventory (On-hand + 'real' In-transit) is 329 units. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), the base stock requirement is approximately 285 units (3 * 95). However, because the OR backend subtracts the inflated In-transit value (1339) from the base_stock calculation, it would effectively order 0 unless the parameters are adjusted. To force an order and maintain stock continuity, mu_hat is set to 550, which targets a base stock level that accounts for the phantom inventory while ensuring we cover demand for the remaining 10 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom inventory inflating 'In-transit' remains confirmed at 1010 units. Real pipeline is 329 units (P40). Demand regime (P26-P40) is stable at ~95 units.

In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. The demand regime (P26-P41) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 95 units and a standard deviation of 19. The 'In-transit' figure of 1339 units is heavily inflated by 1010 units of confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 329 units (the P40 order). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I continue to use L=2. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive 'In-transit' total and deciding not to order, I use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I set the parameter to (1+L) * 95 = 285. For sigma_hat, I set it to sqrt(1+L) * 19 \u2248 33. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the variability of arrivals. Using explicit values allows the controller to target the correct stock level regardless of the corrupted 'In-transit' metric.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1339 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion is confirmed lost or highly probable lost. Specifically, 1010 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30) have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered phantom inventory. The effective pipeline consists of the P40 order (329 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P26-P42) has stabilized in a lower regime with a mean of approximately 98 units/period, down from the previous ~190. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am uses 'explicit' methods to target a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock, manually offsetting the 1010 phantom units. Targeting a 3-period coverage (L=2) at ~100/period plus safety stock (~1.5 * std), I set mu_hat to cover the expected demand and sigma_hat to handle volatility, effectively instructing the backend to order since (base_stock - reported_pipeline) will be adjusted by my explicit value selection.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 44. Demand context: The demand regime remains stable around ~95-100 units/period (mean of P26-P43 is ~98). Lead time context: Actual lead times vary from 1 to 3 periods; the Period 40 order arrived in Period 43 (3 periods). In-transit reconciliation: Reported In-transit is 1019. Known lost/phantom shipments: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30 total 1010 units. Therefore, the 'real' pipeline inventory is 1019 - 1010 = 9 units (the order from P43). On-hand inventory is 213 (after P43 arrival/demand). Strategy: To handle the phantom 'In-transit' inflation, I use 'explicit' methods to ensure the OR backend ignores the 1010 lost units when calculating the order. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = (2+1) * 100 = 300 units. To achieve this when the system thinks pipeline is 1010, I must set the mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or use explicit overrides. Given on-hand=213 and real-pipeline=9, total real inventory=222. Target for L+1 (3 periods) is ~300. Thus, I want an order of ~78 units. To force this, I set mu_hat explicitly to cover the phantom stock plus the desired base stock (1010 + 300 = 1310).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing a demand regime that stabilized around 95-100 units starting in Period 26. Recent demand (P40-P44) has an average of 106 units, showing slight volatility but remaining within the expected range. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' inflation. Current In-transit is 1137 units. Based on historical analysis, 1010 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). Subtracting these phantom units from the reported 1137 leaves a real pipeline of 127 units, which corresponds to the orders from P43 (9 units) and P44 (118 units). With on-hand inventory at 129 units and a real pipeline of 127, the total effective inventory is 256 units. The target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1) at a mean of ~100 is roughly 300-350 units. To override the OR backend's use of the inflated 'In-transit' (1137), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (mean ~100, std ~30) and bypass the phantom inventory calculations. This ensures the backend places an order to bridge the gap between effective inventory and the required safety level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 104 units (averaging P40-P45: 90, 87, 154, 116, 84, 129). The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1246 units remains heavily inflated by 1010 lost units identified in previous periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). Subtracting these phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is 236 units (orders from P44 and P45). With 9 units on-hand, total available inventory is approximately 245 units. The base stock target for a 3-period lead-time window (L=2 + current period) at ~104 units/period is roughly 312 units plus safety stock. Due to the backend's capped policy and its failure to recognize lost orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order that bridges the gap between the real 245 units and the desired inventory level, bypassing the 1010 units of phantom pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at around 95-100 units per period (P26-P46 mean: 97.4). Lead times show variability (1-3 periods), with recent arrivals (P43, P45) confirming a 2-3 period range. The most critical factor is 'phantom inventory': of the 1246 units reported 'In-transit', 1010 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P44 (118 units) and P45 (118 units), totaling 236 units. On-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout, I use 'explicit' methods to bypass the inflated 'In-transit' figure. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at a mean of ~100. mu_hat = 300. To account for the 236 units already in the real pipeline and aiming for a base stock around 350-400 (including safety stock), I set mu_hat to 350. Since the system subtracts the reported 1246 'In-transit', I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for this: mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock) + (Phantom Inventory) = 400 + 1010 = 1410. This forces the system to recognize the need for new stock despite the high reported in-transit value.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 1010 units. Real pipeline is 236 units (P44, P45). Consistent demand mean ~98.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1448 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 1010 of these are 'phantom' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). The 'real' pipeline inventory consists of P44 (118 units), P45 (118 units), and P47 (202 units), totaling 438 units. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 26, with an average of approximately 98 units per period. The inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand at the start of Period 48. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive phantom 'In-transit' and failing to order, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate a base stock target that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) at ~98 units/period plus a safety buffer, adjusted to counteract the 1010 phantom units. Target Base Stock \u2248 (3 * 98) + (1.64 * sqrt(3) * 25) \u2248 365 units. To force the OR engine to order approximately enough to reach this target while it subtracts 1448 in-transit, I provide an explicit mu_hat that effectively hides the phantom stock: mu_hat = 365 + 1010 = 1375.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. Total In-transit is 1448 units. Based on historical analysis, 1010 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30). Additionally, the orders from P44 (118 units) and P45 (118 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods; they are highly likely lost. The P47 (202 units) order is 2 periods old and still within the arrival window. Real pipeline is approximately 202 units. The demand regime (P26-P48) has stabilized with a mean of ~99 units. Since this is the penultimate period (P49 of 50), any order placed now (L=2) would arrive during Period 51 arrival resolution\u2014AFTER the final Period 50 demand resolution. Therefore, placing an order now is useless as it won't satisfy Period 50 demand and only incurs holding costs if it arrived. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 to prevent the OR backend from placing an unnecessary terminal order.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: P44 and P45 orders (236 units total) are likely lost, increasing phantom inventory from 1010 to 1246 units. System enters terminal phase; orders placed in P49 will not arrive in time for P50 demand resolution.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. Crucially, any order placed in the decision phase of Period 50 will only arrive, at the earliest, during the Arrival Resolution of Period 50 (if lead time is 0) or more likely in subsequent periods. However, the simulation ends after Period 50's demand resolution. Given the promised lead time is 2 and the minimum observed lead time is 1, a Period 50 order will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand. Additionally, current on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual 'real' pipeline is likely empty, as the 'In-transit' of 1448 is almost entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P30, P44, P45 totaling 1246 units, plus recent orders P47 that are not yet arrived). Since ordering now incurs a cost but cannot generate revenue within the game's horizon, the optimal decision for Period 50 is to order 0. We achieve this by setting L to 'default' and mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value of 0, which results in a base stock of 0 and an order of 0.
