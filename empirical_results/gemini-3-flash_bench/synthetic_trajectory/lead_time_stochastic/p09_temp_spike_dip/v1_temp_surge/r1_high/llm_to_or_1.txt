Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 2. There is no historical performance yet available beyond the initial 5 samples, which show a mean demand of 114.4 and a standard deviation of 15.6. Since we have no evidence of lead time deviations or demand regime shifts, I am using the default settings. The OR backend will compute the base stock using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*114.4 = 343.2, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*15.6 = 27.0. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 86 units, which resulted in lost sales since the starting on-hand inventory was 0. Because the lead time is 2, we do not expect and have not seen any arrivals yet (arrivals happen during the period and are reported in the next period's 'conclude' message). The historical mean demand across the first 5 samples provided is approximately 114.6 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. For now, I will use 'default' settings for lead time and sigma, but use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the historical data set) to ensure the baseline demand forecast is grounded in the provided samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (136 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 277 units. According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because arrivals haven't occurred yet. Demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game data) was 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 (avg 114.4). Recent demand in the game history (P1: 86, P2: 132) averages 109. There is no evidence yet that the promised lead time of 2 is incorrect. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the latest baseline while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution and its arrival is confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which we read at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, we have had 0 sales because on-hand inventory has remained 0. Demand for the first three periods was 86, 132, and 100 (average ~106). Since the promised lead time of 2 is not being met (no arrivals yet from P1), I will explicitly set L=3 to account for this delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the observed demand mean (~106) and volatility, which will be scaled by (1+L) in the backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1244.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the history for chips(Regular). Analysis of arrivals in Period 4 shows significant lead-time variability: the P1 order arrived after 3 periods (delayed), while the P3 order arrived after 1 period (early). The average lead time from these two arrivals is (3+1)/2 = 2, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the first 4 periods (86, 132, 100, 75) averages 98.25 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 181 units, with 246 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Since the mean demand is stable around 100-110 units and there is no strong evidence yet for a structural shift or seasonal trend from the provided sample data (Period 1-5 mean is ~114), I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the OR backend average observed data. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the base demand level and current variance, providing a balanced stock-up signal against the high current pipeline.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time patterns of chips(Regular). Current on-hand inventory is 75 units, with 290 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods remains stable (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), yielding an average of approximately 114.4 units per period. The lead-time observation shows variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period, averaging 2 periods (consistent with the promised lead time). The 'arrived=0' in Period 5 conclude is normal for an order placed in Period 4 with a lead time of 1+. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the stable recent history. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that covers demand for L+1 periods (343.2 units) and maintains a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 290 in-transit. Looking at the history, demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~96 units (P1-P6 demand: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77). Lead times are volatile: P1 order arrived after 3 periods, P3 order arrived after 1 period, and P2 (ordered 136) is currently missing/overdue (it should have arrived by P5 if L=2 or P6 if L=3). This suggests potential lost shipments or high lead-time variance. The in-transit 290 units consist of the P2 order (136), P4 (110), and P5 (44). Since we are out of stock and demand is steady, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend factor in the observed variability. However, because we have lost/delayed stock (P2 order), I need the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock to cover current and future periods while we wait for arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable: observed L=3 and L=1; P2 order (136 units) is currently overdue as of P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1230.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we are managing a situation with highly unstable lead times. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, respectively. Crucially, the order for 136 units placed in Period 2 is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it is likely lost or significantly delayed. The on-hand inventory is 43 units, while the in-transit pipeline (excluding the likely lost P2 order) consists of P5 (44), P6 (0), and P7 (137), totaling 181 units. Average demand over the 7 periods is approximately 92 units. To prevent stockouts given the volatility, I am setting L to explicit value 3 (the observed maximum) and mu_hat to a recent average (N=7) to stay responsive to demand levels. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures the high variance caused by the erratic order arrivals and demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 2 (136 units) confirmed overdue (5 periods elapsed vs promised 2); lead time variance documented as 1-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2316.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The current demand history (including provided pre-simulation samples and simulation history) shows a relatively stable mean of ~102 units/period. The key issue is lead-time instability. Observed lead times are: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), P5 (L=3), P7 (L=1). The order from Period 2 (136 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly past the observed max lead time (3) and promised lead time (2), so I am treating it as lost. Total pipeline (In-transit) is 218 units, which consists of the likely lost P2 order (136) and the P8 order (82). Since on-hand is 97 and only 82 units are realistically in transit, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will use L=2 (promised) for the backend formula but account for the lost stock by allowing the OR engine to order up. Setting mu_hat to the mean of the last 8 periods (approx 102 * (1+L)) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 2 order (136 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Future pipeline should discount this specific quantity to avoid under-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2021.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lost shipment of 136 units from Period 2. The 'In-transit' figure of 179 units currently includes the 136 lost units plus 43 units ordered in Period 9. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (179) from the target base stock, it will significantly under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculation mu_hat as (1 + L) * average_demand + lost_units. With L=2 (promised) and an average demand (~105 units), the base needs to cover 3 periods (~315 units). Adding the 136 lost units brings the target to approximately 451. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=9 to capture the observed demand volatility since the start. For L, I use 'calculate' to let the backend factor in the high variance (lead times of 1 and 3 periods observed).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' is out of stock (on-hand: 0). Recent demand (Periods 4-10) is stable with a mean of 96 units/period. The lead time is highly variable: observed arrivals show lead times of 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time closer to 2 periods, but with significant instability. The Period 2 order (136 units) is long overdue and confirmed lost, and the Period 9 order (43 units) is currently past its promised lead time. Following the lost order adjustment, I am set to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95). I am using 'recent_N' for demand (N=7) to focus on post-startup stability and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed shifts (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: P9 order (43 units) is potentially delayed; lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

In Period 12, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with high demand pressure. Lead time analysis shows historical values of 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1 periods. The average lead time is 2.0, aligning with the promised 2, but the variance is high. Significantly, the Period 2 order (136 units) is definitively lost (10 periods elapsed), and the Period 9 order (43 units) is overdue (3 periods elapsed). Currently, 'In-transit' is 431 units, but this includes the lost 136 units from P2. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 295 units (431 - 136). The OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' figure, which will cause it to under-order by 136 units unless we adjust parameters. I will use 'explicit' lead time L=2 to reflect the average, and use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full demand profile which averages ~102/period. To compensate for the 136-unit ghost inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the expected (1+L)*mean demand plus the 136-unit deficit: (3 * 102) + 136 = 442.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Period 2 order of 136 units is lost; logic must account for a 136-unit inflation in the 'In-transit' metric provided by the system.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a mean of ~104 units over the last 12 periods. The critical issue remains the supply chain: lead times are erratic (varying between 1 and 3 periods), and the Period 2 order (136 units) is definitively lost. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 307 units, but 136 of these correspond to the lost Period 2 shipment, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 171 units (307 - 136). To compensate for the lost units and maintain service levels under lead-time uncertainty (L can be up to 3), I will set L to 3. I will use a recent demand window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the most stable recent demand regime. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit quantity of 307 from the base_stock, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target stock by 136 units. Target mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + 136 = (4 * 104) + 136 \u2248 552.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14. Historical demand analysis (all samples) shows a mean of approximately 105 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant volatility (L=1 to L=3). I will use L=3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts during delivery delays. A critical factor is the 'In-transit' metric: the Period 2 order of 136 units is definitively lost (12 periods elapsed), meaning the system's 'In-transit: 483' is actually 'Effective In-transit: 347'. To compensate for this 136-unit hole in the inventory logic and avoid under-ordering, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. My target base stock for a (L+1)=4 period window is ~420 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough, I set mu_hat to 556 (calculated as 420 expected demand + 136 lost unit correction). sigma_hat is set to 30 to cover demand volatility over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 15. The 'In-transit' metric is 510 units, but this includes 136 units from Period 2 which are confirmed lost (now 13 periods overdue). The effective pipeline inventory is actually 374 units (510 - 136). The inventory on-hand is currently 0. Demand for the last 14 periods has averaged ~104 units, with recent periods (P10-P14) averaging ~115 units. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2.22 based on arrivals). To account for the lost shipment in the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must increase mu_hat by the lost quantity (136) so the OR engine orders enough to cover the shortfall created by the ghost 'In-transit' units. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand forecasting to capture the current mean (~114) and set lead time to 3 to be conservative against the frequent 3-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline discrepancy: The system-reported 'In-transit' includes 136 units from a lost Period 2 order. Period 15 effective pipeline is 374, not 510.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0. The system-reported 'In-transit' is 586 units, but this includes a 136-unit order from Period 2 that has been confirmed lost (14 periods elapsed). Therefore, the actual effective pipeline is 450 units (586 - 136). Historical lead times are highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P11=3, P12=3). I will use L=3 to ensure safe coverage given this volatility. Demand has remained relatively stable; the mean of the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is approximately 107.7 units. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this recent baseline while providing enough variance to account for stockout risks, as we are currently in a stockout state (ending inventory 0 for the last three periods). The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand, adjusted for the (inflated) pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 17, On-hand=0, In-transit=410. Demand has spiked in Period 16 (195 units), significantly higher than the previous average of ~108. I must account for this potential regime shift or volatility increase. Pipeline Analysis: The reported In-transit (410) includes the 136-unit lost order from Period 2. The effective pipeline is actually 410 - 136 = 274 units. These units represent orders from Period 14 (123) and Period 15 (151). Lead Time: While the promised L=2, observed lead times are frequently 3 periods (e.g., P11, P12, P13 all arrived with L=3). To be safe, I will set L to 3. Demand Forecast: Given the Period 16 spike, I will use a recent N=5 to capture mean demand (approx 123) and allow for higher variance. mu_hat needs to cover L+1 = 4 periods of demand. 4 * 123 = 492 units. Parameters: L=3 (explicit to account for consistent 3-period arrivals), mu_hat = 492 (explicit for 4 periods of demand), sigma_hat = 110 (explicitly high to handle the recent demand spike and erratic lead times). By setting a high mu_hat and an explicit L, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that should trigger a replenishment order to cover the effective pipeline deficit after accounting for the lost 136 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 17 sales, and demand has spiked significantly (195 in P16, 251 in P17) compared to the historical average (approx. 100-110). This requires an upward adjustment of mu_hat to prevent stockouts during this high-demand regime. Regarding arrivals, the Period 14 order arrived in 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 501 units is inflated by 136 units from the lost Period 2 order (confirmed lost for 15+ periods), making the effective pipeline 365 units (orders from P15 and P17). Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1-3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent recently; however, I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to average these observations. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) captures the current demand surge (last 3 periods: 114, 195, 251).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 16: demand surged from an average of ~108 to ~223 over the last two periods (+100%). High demand is sustained for 2 periods so far.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system is facing a significant shortage (On-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) has surged to 211.7 units, compared to the previous average of ~108. The lead time remains unstable, with 3 periods being the most frequent observation for delayed arrivals. The system reports 801 units in-transit, but 136 of these are known to be lost (ordered Period 2), making the effective pipeline 665 units. To address the demand surge, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the 200+ demand level. Given the frequent 3-period lead times, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). This higher target is necessary to recover from the current stockout and provide a safety buffer against the volatile arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: 3-period average increased to 211.7 units (~100% increase). Effective pipeline remains -136 units relative to system 'In-transit' due to the lost Period 2 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 203 units (195, 251, 189, 177), a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~108. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating an 'explicit' lead time setting of 3 to ensure sufficient stock coverage for the current period and the arrival duration. The system-reported In-transit of 960 units includes a 136-unit order from Period 2 that has been confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 824 units. To ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order that accounts for the higher demand and the lost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Using a 3-period lead time, mu_hat represents (1+L) * mean_demand. With L=3 and mean_demand ~203, mu_hat = 4 * 203 = 812. However, because the system's pipeline inventory is over-reported by 136 units (lost P2 order), it will erroneously reduce the order size. To compensate, I increase mu_hat by 136, resulting in a target of 948 units. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high-demand volatility (std approx 33), calculated as sqrt(1+L) * 33 \u2248 66.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 1057 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, 136 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, making the 'effective' pipeline 921 units. Lead times have been erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average closer to 2-3; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed data. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting Period 16. The average demand across Periods 16-20 is 213.2 units, a ~100% increase from the previous baseline of ~108. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime fully. To handle the inventory shortage (on-hand is 0) and the higher volatility associated with the demand surge, I'll use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat as well. Setting mu_hat to explicitly account for the new demand mean (approx 213 * 3 = 639) ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that can cover the current 3-period lead-time window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 mean is 213.2 units (+97% vs baseline). Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods. Pipeline correction: Subtract 136 lost units from system 'In-transit' for all availability calculations.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system records on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 1057. Adjusting for the 136-unit lost order from Period 2 (confirmed in Carry-over Insights), the effective pipeline is 921 units. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16; the average demand from Periods 16 to 21 is approximately 217.3 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238), which is more than double the initial baseline (~108). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with several recent orders (P17, P18, P19, P20) still in transit. Given the current stockout and the high demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this surge. We use L=3 'explicit' to account for frequent delays and ensure the base stock covers the longer replenishment cycle. This aggressive setting helps the OR engine overcome the stockout quickly once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P16-P21): average demand increased to ~217 units (+100% vs baseline). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods). Pipeline correction: actual in-transit is (System In-transit - 136).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 224 units over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), representing a ~100% increase over the initial baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there have been no arrivals for the last 5 periods (P18-P22), indicating significant stockouts and potential delivery clusters or delays. The system 'In-transit' figure of 1057 units is inflated by 136 units from a lost Period 2 order, making the 'effective' pipeline 921 units. Lead times are extremely volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent orders from P17 (214 units), P18 (300 units), and P19 (159 units) all overdue if we strictly followed a 2-period promise. To account for the sustained high demand, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=7 to capture the shift accurately. Lead time L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of historical arrivals and the current observed delays, ensuring the OR engine calculates a target stock level sufficient to cover the extended delivery window.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime persists: P16-P22 average demand is ~224 units. Total pipeline continues to include 136 units from a lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24. Since Period 16, demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-demand regime, with an average of approximately 219 units per period (P16-P23 range: 177-254). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports 960 units in-transit. However, based on sustained observations (Period 9-23), 136 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost, making the effective in-transit quantity 824 units. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using an explicit L value of 3 to provide more coverage against delays. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand levels seen since Period 16 (avg ~219 units per period), resulting in a base stock targeted at covering (1+3) periods of that demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) remains stable at ~219 units/period. Lead time remains erratic but generally 3 periods for safety. Effective pipeline is System In-transit minus 136 lost units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the window from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 221 units, representing a sustained ~100% increase over the initial baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 981 units in-transit, but as documented since Period 9, 136 units from Period 2 are lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 845 units. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=4). Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target of roughly 884 units (4 periods * ~221 demand); after subtracting the effective pipeline of 845, the system will place a corrective order to reach the desired service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1, q=0.95).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that started around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (10 samples), the mean is approximately 214.7 units, which is a ~100% increase over the baseline observed in Periods 1-15. Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; a defensive estimate of L=3 is used to ensure sufficient base stock. A critical pipeline correction is required: Period 2's order of 136 units is confirmed lost (now 24 periods overdue) but remains in the system's 'In-transit' figure. Consequently, the effective pipeline is (985 - 136) = 849 units. To compensate for this 136-unit ghost inventory in the OR engine's logic (where base_stock - pipeline = order), I will provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that accounts for the high demand regime and the need to offset the lost 136 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock for L=3 is (1+3) * 214.7 = 858.8. To force the OR backend to order correctly despite the 136-unit overstatement in In-Transit, the mu_hat must be set to (Base Stock + 136) = 994.8. Sigma is calculated using the standard deviation of the last 10 periods (~32) scaled by sqrt(1+3), resulting in ~64.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P25) stabilized at ~215 units/period. The 136-unit Period 2 order remains 'In-transit' but is lost; all manual calculations must subtract this from the system total.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 Context: On-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' is 1101, but the Carry-Over Insights confirm that 136 units from Period 2 are lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 965. Demand Analysis: The high-demand regime (starting Period 16) showed an average of ~215-220 units. However, Period 26 demand dropped to 95 units. To avoid overreacting to a single point while acknowledging the previous high-demand regime, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (P16 to P26) which averages ~189 units. Lead Time: Actual lead times have consistently been 3 periods. To account for this and ensure the OR backend covers enough demand during the replenishment cycle, I will explicitly set L=3 and mu_hat based on the last 11 samples. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to capture the high volatility observed between the high-demand peaks (250+) and the recent low (95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 (avg ~215) showed a significant drop in Period 26 to 95. Effective pipeline remains System In-transit minus 136 lost units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1101 units In-transit, but this includes a 136-unit shipment from Period 2 that must be treated as lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 965 units (1101 - 136). The high-demand regime (Period 16\u201325) which averaged ~215 units per period has clearly shifted. Demand in Period 26 was 95 and Period 27 was 84, suggesting a return to the baseline levels observed in Periods 1-15 (avg ~105). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and the effective pipeline (965) is significantly higher than any reasonable forecast for the next 4 periods (max lead time 3 + review period 1), implying heavy over-ordering occurred during the late high-demand phase. I will set the lead time to 3 to account for the frequent observed delays, and use a 4-period demand window (recent_N=4) to capture the sharp downturn from the high-demand peaks. No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend given the massive pipeline inventory relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: demand dropped from high-regime (~215) back to baseline levels (~90). Effective pipeline remains (System In-transit minus 136 units) due to the lost P2 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted back to a lower baseline as of Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 26-28), demand levels are 95, 84, and 121, averaging approximately 100 units/period. This represents a significant drop from the high-demand regime (~215 units) seen between Periods 16-25. Consequently, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with this new lower-demand regime. Regarding lead time, it remains erratic, with recent observations showing a return toward the promised 2 periods (P26 order arrived in 2 periods), though history suggests 3 is a common upper bound. I will use L=2 (default) but ensure the statistical buffer handles the variance. Critically, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 985 units includes 136 units from a shipment placed in Period 2 which is long-lost. The effective pipeline to the OR backend should be 849. However, the backend logic for (base_stock - pipeline) uses the system's internal tracking. My parameter choices (L, mu, sigma) will result in a lower base stock target that accounts for the lower demand, though the 'ghost' inventory from Period 2 will continue to suppress new orders slightly. Given the current On-hand is 0 and high-volume arrivals are likely pending from the large orders placed during the high-demand peak, a conservative parameter set is necessary to avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we are managing a recovery from a stockout. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit/cost ratio supporting a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95). A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 26, where average demand dropped from ~215 back to baseline levels (~100). The average demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 99.5. Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use a 3-period lead time (L=3) for safety to cover the pipeline. As consistently noted in Carry-over Insights, the 'In-transit' metric (985) is inflated by 136 units from a lost Period 2 order. The effective pipeline is actually 849 units. This effective pipeline is currently very high relative to the new demand levels (approximately 8 periods of coverage), so the OR backend should naturally suppress new ordering. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime and 'explicit' for lead time to ensure the safety buffer accounts for historical delays.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high stockout risk with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has returned to baseline levels (approx. 100 units/period) following a significant high-demand regime that ended around Period 26. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to guard against the risk of longer arrivals and ensure sufficient pipeline coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 985 units is inflated by a 136-unit order from Period 2 that is definitively lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 985 - 136 = 849 units. Since the backend OR uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide orders, and 849 units far exceeds the required inventory for baseline demand (approx. 400 total units over a 3+1 period window), I expect the backend to place zero orders. This is appropriate as the system is correcting for previous large orders placed during the high-demand surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized baseline demand (Periods 26-30).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at baseline levels (avg ~103) for the last 5 periods (P26-P30). Effective pipeline inventory must always be calculated as (System In-transit - 136) to account for the lost Period 2 shipment.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a baseline level following a temporary high-demand regime. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P26-P31), the average demand is 105.3. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this current regime. Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure sufficient buffer against potential delivery delays. The 'In-transit' figure of 985 units is highly inflated due to a 136-unit lost shipment from Period 2 and a massive backlog of orders placed during the previous high-demand period (P17-P25) that are presumably still in transit. Given on-hand is 0 and demand is baseline, the OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers (1+L) periods of demand. Setting L=3 and using the recent mean (~105) tells the OR backend to target a pipeline that can handle the next 4 periods (~421 units). Since the corrected pipeline (985 - 136 = 849) already exceeds this target, the OR engine will likely result in a zero order, which is appropriate given the current massive over-supply in transit.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 33. On-hand inventory is 0. System reports 'In-transit' as 985 units, but history confirms that 136 units from Period 2 are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 849 (985 - 136). The system has recently experienced a major demand regime shift: from P16-P25, demand surged to ~215/period, but since P26, it has returned to a baseline of ~103/period. The last 7 periods (P26-P32) show a very stable mean of 104.8. 

Lead Time: Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for older shipments. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the backend base-stock calculation covers enough safety stock for the persistent variability. 

Forecast: Demand has been back at baseline for 7 periods. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization and ignore the P16-P25 spike. This results in mu_hat targeting ~(1+3)*105 = 420. Given the effective pipeline of 849 units exceeds the required base stock, the OR engine will likely place zero or minimal orders until the arrivals from previous periods (P15-P25) clear out of the pipeline resolving the massive backlog.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at baseline levels (avg ~105) for 7 consecutive periods (P26-P32) following the P16-P25 surge. Lost shipment from P2 (136 units) remains in system 'In-transit' count; effective pipeline = System In-transit - 136.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following a significant surge between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, the demand samples are 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this stable 'baseline' regime. Lead time remains erratic, often hitting 3 periods; I will explicitly set L=3 as a conservative measure to ensure the backend covers a sufficient lead-time window. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 985 units is extremely high, and historical tracking confirms that 136 units from Period 2 are permanently lost. However, even accounting for the lost units, the pipeline (985 - 136 = 849) is massive compared to current demand (approx 105/period). With L=3, the (L+1) window requires ~420 units, meaning the current pipeline is more than double what is needed. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods will lead the OR backend to realize we are over-stocked in the pipeline and reduce/stop new orders until the excess is cleared.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its baseline level following the Period 16-25 surge. For the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is approximately 103 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 985 units, but this includes the 136-unit shipment from Period 2 that has been confirmed lost (now overdue by 33 periods). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 849 units (985 - 136). The lead time remains volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using L=3 to ensure the order covers the risk of longer delivery times. I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture only the current stable baseline regime (P26-P34), ignoring the previous high-demand surge. This setting ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (3+1) periods of demand at ~103 units/period, correctly accounting for the lost units in the pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following the surge in Periods 16-25. For the last 10 periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged 104.8 units. The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 985 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 136 units from an order placed in Period 2 are confirmed lost but still included in the system's in-transit metric. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 849 units (985 - 136). With On-hand inventory at 0 and current demand stability, the existing pipeline of 849 units (mostly from recent orders not yet arrived) is substantial relative to a (L+1) demand requirement of roughly 420 units (assuming L=3). No new order is needed this period as the effective pipeline significantly exceeds the likely base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stabilized demand mean and variance while maintaining an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the observed volatility and prevent stockouts during the current zero-inventory state.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 37. The historical data shows a demand regime shift back to a baseline of ~103 units/period since Period 26, following a high-demand spike (P16-P25). For the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is approximately 102.6 units. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but have also shown significant delays; notably, orders from P17, P18, P19, and the older lost P2 order remain in the 'In-transit' count without arriving. Total system In-transit is 985, which includes the 136 units from the P2 lost shipment and likely several other stalled high-volume orders from the P17-P19 period (214+300+159 units). Since On-hand is 0 and recent demand is ~103, I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 samples (the stable period) to reflect the current regime. I'll use L=3 to account for the observed volatility in arrivals. The OR backend will see a high Pipeline Inventory (System In-transit) and may not order if 985 > base_stock; however, by setting mu_hat for the current regime and using recent variance, we ensure the safety stock is appropriately sized for the current 103-unit demand level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the post-surge baseline regime (approx. 100 units/period). However, the critical issue is a massive pipeline inventory imbalance. Current 'In-transit' is reported as 985 units, while average demand is ~100. Even after subtracting the 136-unit lost shipment from Period 2, the effective in-transit is 849 units. With on-hand at 0 and demand at ~100, we are expecting nearly 8.5 periods' worth of stock to arrive. This massive backlog likely stems from previously delayed orders finally moving through the system or over-ordering during the Period 16-25 surge. Given the current inventory position and the return to lower demand levels, the inventory is significantly over-extended. I will set L=3 (the upper end of observed lead times) to reflect ongoing volatility, and use recent_N (N=12, covering the post-surge period from P26-P37) to capture the current stable demand (mean ~98). No new orders should be placed until this massive pipeline is resolved.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 39. The demand has stabilized at a baseline level (avg ~101 units) since Period 26. However, the system reports 985 units in-transit, which includes a 136-unit order from Period 2 that the history and carry-over insights confirm as lost. Therefore, the effective in-transit quantity is 849 (985 - 136). The inventory on-hand is currently 0, largely because no orders have been placed since Period 26. As the promised lead time is 2 but physical arrivals often take 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety cover. To re-establish the stock position for this baseline demand, I am using recent_N for both mean and variance (N=13, covering the stable period P26-P38). This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~400 units). Given the effective pipeline (849) already exceeds this, the OR backend (correctly adjusted by my L=3 setting) will likely recommend a zero or small order, bleeding off the massive incoming pipeline which consists of earlier large orders (P15, P17, P18, P19) that have not concluded yet but are expected to arrive based on the 'In-transit' signal.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the baseline level following a surge during Periods 16-25. For the last 14 periods (P26-P39), demand has averaged approximately 100.3 units. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue to assume L=3 for the safety buffer. A critical persistent issue is the Period 2 order of 136 units, which is confirmed lost but remains in the system's 'In-transit' count. Currently, the system shows 985 units in transit. After subtracting the 136 lost units, the effective pipeline is 849 units. Given the baseline demand of ~100/period and a lead time of 3, the desired base stock is roughly 400-500 units. Since the effective pipeline (849) significantly exceeds this, no new orders are required. mu_hat is set to reflect the current baseline using recent_N=14 (P26-P39) to ensure the OR backend utilizes the correct demand profile.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 40, a very large volume of stock (effective 849 units) is in-transit following multiple periods of zero orders, likely due to previous over-ordering during the high-demand regime or logic to flush the back-order. Substantial arrivals are expected soon which will satisfy demand for several periods. The P2 lost shipment (136 units) remains a phantom in system 'In-transit' metrics.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at the baseline level (approx. 104 units/period) following the high-demand surge from periods 16-25. The most recent demand (Period 40) was 136, but the average since Period 26 is approximately 104 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but the system reports a very high 'In-transit' of 985 units. Accounting for the 136-unit lost shipment from Period 2, the effective pipeline is 849 units. This massive pipeline is the result of previous orders that have not yet arrived due to ongoing lead time delays/volatility. Since this effective pipeline (849 units) far exceeds the base stock level required for a 3-period lead time (approx. 416 units), the OR backend should order 0 units. I am setting parameters to reflect the current baseline demand (mean ~104) and a conservative lead time of 3 periods to ensure the OR logic recognizes the inventory surplus.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a baseline level (approx. 104 units/period) following the high-demand surge seen between Periods 16-25. Currently, the system reports 985 units 'In-transit'. Accounting for the known 136-unit lost shipment from Period 2, the effective pipeline is 849 units. This represents approximately 8 periods of demand. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and several large orders from previous periods (including Period 15, 17, 18, 19, and 24/25) are effectively stuck or significantly delayed but still counted as in-transit, I must maintain zero new orders until the existing pipeline begins to arrive to avoid excessive holding costs. The OR engine will naturally produce a zero order as long as base_stock (calculated from mu_hat) is less than the pipeline inventory. I am setting L=3 to reflect the observed historical maximum lead time, and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent 16-period regime (P26-P41) where demand has returned to normal levels (mean ~104.3, std ~22).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 985 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, 136 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 849 units. Despite these 849 units being in-transit for many periods, we have seen zero arrivals since Period 28. This suggests a systemic failure in the supply chain or an extremely elongated lead time for previous orders (Periods 15-25). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts. Since demand has returned to the baseline (average ~105 since Period 26), and the effective pipeline (849 units) is already more than 8x the average periodic demand, any further ordering would be reckless given the holding costs and the massive volume of pending stock that could arrive at any moment. I will set L to a high explicit value of 3 to reflect the current delivery delays and keep demand parameters at the baseline levels (using recent_N=17 to cover the period since the last surge ended) to prevent the OR backend from generating new orders.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival drought: No shipments have arrived since Period 28 despite 849 effective units being in-transit. Supply chain remains highly unreliable.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 985 units. Accounting for the long-lost Period 2 shipment (136 units) which remains in the system count, the effective pipeline is 849 units. No shipments have arrived since Period 28, indicating a severe supply chain disruption or extremely delayed lead times. Current demand has consolidated around a baseline mean of ~105 units (P26-P43 average is ~106). Since the effective pipeline of 849 units is enough to cover roughly 8 periods of demand at the current rate (849 / 105 \u2248 8.08), and there are only 7 decisions left in the game (P44-P50), no further orders are required. The OR backend needs to be instructed to wait for the arrival of this massive pipeline. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable recent history (N=18, covering the post-spike period) and set the lead time to an explicit value that reflects the current prolonged arrivals without triggering fresh orders. Setting L=3 (the upper bound of typical transit) and using recent_N for demand ensures the base_stock calculation remains realistic while the high pipeline suppresses new ordering.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall: No arrivals since Period 28. Effective pipeline of 849 units (System 985 - 136 lost) is sufficient to cover all remaining periods (P44-P50) once it arrives.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 50. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 985 units. However, as documented since Period 9, 136 units from a Period 2 order are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 849 units. Demand has returned to a baseline regime since Period 26, with the average demand for the last 19 periods being approximately 104.9 units. At this average, 849 units are sufficient to cover demand for more than 8 periods, which exceeds the remaining 6 periods of the game (P45-P50). No orders have arrived since Period 28, indicating a significant supply chain stall; however, placing more orders while having a massive (though stalled) pipeline would only increase future holding costs without solving the immediate stockout, as the backend policy would likely cap or zero out anyway. I will maintain a mu_hat and sigma_hat reflective of the current baseline demand (P26-P44) and use explicit L=3 to account for the erratic and currently prolonged lead times. No new orders are expected or desired given the current inventory position and time remaining.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 50. The game is near its end. The most critical issue is the massive supply chain failure: no shipments have arrived since Period 28, despite an 'In-transit' balance of 985 units (including a phantom 136 units from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 849 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the effective pipeline (849 units) is more than enough to cover the remaining demand for periods 46-50 (estimated at ~100 units/period, requiring ~500 units total), and since orders placed now (L=2 promised, but actual is much longer/unpredictable) likely won't arrive before the game ends at Period 50, placing additional orders is unnecessary and would only risk further inventory holding costs if the logjam clears. We set parameters to reflect the baseline demand regime (avg ~105) observed since Period 26 to maintain a stable base stock, but with the massive in-transit volume, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains completely stalled; no arrivals since Period 28. Effective pipeline (849 units) exceeds total projected demand for the remainder of the game (Periods 46-50).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The supply chain has been completely stalled with no arrivals since Period 28. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 985 units. Accounting for the 136-unit lost shipment from Period 2 (confirmed in Carry-over insights), the effective pipeline is 849 units. Demand has stabilized at a baseline average of approximately 105 units per period (P26-P46). With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), the total projected demand is approximately 420 units. Since the effective pipeline (849 units) is more than double the remaining projected demand, any further ordering would only result in high holding costs if the stock arrives, or exacerbate the 'phantom' inventory issue. Therefore, the strategy remains to place zero orders. To prevent the OR engine from generating an order, I will set mu_hat to a minimal value (0) and sigma_hat to 0, ensuring the base stock calculation remains below the currently reported in-transit level.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The supply chain has been completely stalled since Period 28, with no units arriving for 19 consecutive periods. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 985 units. Accounting for the 136-unit lost shipment from Period 2, the effective pipeline is 849 units. Total demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50) is expected to be approximately 315 units based on the current baseline average (~105/period). Because the effective pipeline (849 units) vastly exceeds any plausible demand for the remainder of the game, and we currently have zero on-hand inventory to pay holding costs on, the focus is purely on managing the arrival of the massive backlog. No further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current baseline demand and lead time uncertainty, though the 'cap' logic in the OR backend combined with the large pipeline will naturally result in zero orders.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, which is the penultimate period of the game. The primary objective is to avoid any new orders that would arrive after the game ends and minimize holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 0, but there is an 'In-transit' balance of 985 units. Accounting for the known lost shipment of 136 units from Period 2, the effective in-transit inventory is 849 units. Even though there hasn't been a delivery since Period 28, the effective pipeline is more than enough to cover the remaining two periods (49 and 50) given the baseline demand average of ~100. Any new order placed now would not arrive until Period 51 or later (L=2 promised, actual L can be up to 3), which is past the game's horizon. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current baseline demand and ensure no new orders are triggered by maintaining L at the default.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 50). The primary objective throughout the later stages of the game has been managing a massive supply chain stall and a 'phantom' 136-unit in-transit shipment. As of Period 49, no shipments have arrived since Period 28, resulting in a 0 on-hand inventory position for 21 consecutive periods. The system reports 985 units in-transit, 849 of which are genuine orders placed between Periods 15 and 25 (the high-demand regime). Since this is the final period of the game, any new order placed now will not arrive within the game's horizon (promised lead time is 2, meaning it would arrive after Period 50). Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final period is to set parameters that result in a zero order to avoid unnecessary pipeline commitment and focus on the conclusion of the game's logic. I will maintain the baseline demand parameters (P26-P49 mean) to reflect the recent stable period.
