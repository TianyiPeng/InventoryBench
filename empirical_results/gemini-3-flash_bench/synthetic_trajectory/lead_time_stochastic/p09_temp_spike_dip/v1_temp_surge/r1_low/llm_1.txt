The promised lead time is 2 periods. To maximize reward, I must account for demand during the current period (P1), plus the periods until an order placed now arrives (P2 and P3). This requires covering 3 periods of demand (L+1). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~342 units. However, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I need to place an order immediately to begin filling the pipeline. Since the first order won't arrive until Period 3 (if lead time is 2), I will experience lost sales in P1 and P2 regardless. I will order 350 units to establish a stock level that covers the 3-period lead time window and provides a small buffer for variance.",
