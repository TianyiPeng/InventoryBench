Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no history of arrivals or concluded periods to assess actual lead time. The promised lead time is 2. Demand for the first five periods (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) shows an upward trend, particularly in the most recent two periods. The mean of these initial samples is 95.6. Since we are at the very beginning (Period 1), I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 2) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data points (N=5). This sets the base stock level to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand. This approach provides a stable starting point while we wait for the first delivery to confirm the actual lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 140 units. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, those units are scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we lost sales for Period 1 (demand 85, sold 0). Historical demand samples are [82, 89, 65, 106, 136, 85]. The average demand is approximately 94 units per period. With a lead time of 2, the 'lead + review' period is 3 (L+1). My goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) covers the expected demand over those 3 periods. The current pipeline is 140 (in-transit) + 0 (on-hand) = 140. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~282 (94 * 3). The OR backend will order 'base_stock - pipeline', so I will set mu_hat to cover this demand. Since we only have 6 demand samples (5 initial + 1 from game history), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available data while maintaining the promised Lead Time of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand was Period 1: 85, Period 2: 129, and the seeded data shows Period 3: 65, Period 4: 106, Period 5: 136. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the arrivals from orders in Period 1 and Period 2 have not yet occurred. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (140 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. The order from Period 2 (135 units) is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit is 275. Demand appears to be trending upwards from the initial sample of 85. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture this recent variance while keeping the lead time at default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (140 units), Period 2 (135 units), and Period 3 (81 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a lead time longer than 2 periods or a lost shipment. Given that no arrivals have occurred yet, the on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed all demand so far (Periods 1-3). Demand appears to be increasing: 85, 129, 132 (averaging ~115). I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the delay, setting it to 3 to reflect the reality that the P1 order hasn't arrived by P3's conclusion. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the upward trend observed over the first 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $319.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival history for orders placed in Period 1 and Period 3. The Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). This averages to the promised lead time of 2, but suggests variability. The Period 2 order (135 units) is still in-transit and is overdue if L=2; it should have arrived in Period 4. Its absence suggests it might be lost or delayed. Demand data for the first 5 periods are: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136 (mean ~95.6). However, the conclude messages show slightly different demand figures: P1: 85, P2: 129, P3: 132, P4: 108. Using the conclude message data (more reliable as it's the realized demand), the mean is 113.5. Considering the recent trend (132, 108, 136), I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the higher levels seen recently, setting N=3 to cover the slight upward trend.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are faced with 0 on-hand inventory and 402 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (P1: 85, P2: 129, P3: 132, P4: 108, P5: 128), with an average around 116.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual performance has been erratic: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered P2) is currently overdue as of P6. We need to account for this lead time volatility. Given the recent demand samples, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the higher demand level compared to the initial seed data. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability (1 and 3 periods). This setting will help the OR backend target a base stock level that accounts for both the increased demand and the unreliable supply chain timing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (observed 1 and 3 periods); Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-game samples, averaging ~116 over the first 5 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 with 0 units on hand and 500 units in transit. The demand over the last 6 periods averages 113.8, which is significantly higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg 95.6). More critically, the lead time has proven highly volatile: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period, and the orders from P2 (135 units), P5 (117 units), and P6 (98 units) have not yet concluded. This suggests the promised lead time of 2 is unreliable. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR model incorporate the observed variance and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to focus on the higher active game demand levels while weighting the recent stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from pre-game: avg increased from ~96 to ~114 (+18%); Lead time is confirmed volatile (actuals of 1 and 3 periods observed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $405.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to pre-game samples (avg ~114 vs pre-game ~96). Lead times are notably volatile, with actual arrivals taking between 1 and 3 periods (Period 1 arrival took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1, Period 4 took 3). Currently, we have 39 units on-hand and 350 units in-transit. Orders from Periods 2, 5, and 6 are still outstanding. Period 2's order is significantly overdue (placed in P2, current P8), suggesting a potential lost shipment. Given the lead time volatility and higher demand mean, I will use a recent window (N=5) to forecast demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the current regime more accurately. For the lead time L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend factor in the observed variability from concluded shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $514.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 22 and in-transit units totaling 331. Analysis of history shows lead times are highly variable, with values of 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods observed. The average lead time is currently 2.5 periods ( (3+1+3+3)/4 ). Demand has indeed settled into a higher regime compared to pre-game samples. Since Period 1, the mean demand is approximately 116 units (total 928 / 8 periods). Specifically, over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), demand averages ~116.4. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time being higher than the promised 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while smoothing out the volatility observed since the start of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed as volatile and trending towards 3 periods (3 out of 4 arrivals had LT=3); sustained demand regime shift at ~116 units/period confirmed over the last 8 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Specifically, 4 out of 6 documented arrivals had a lead time of 3 periods, while the promised lead time is 2. To prevent stockouts caused by this volatility, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly) to reflect the most common actual lead time. Regarding demand, the mean over the first 9 periods is approximately 111.4 units, which is a sustained increase from the initial pre-game samples (avg 95.6). Since the last period showed a dip to 77, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 110 units) while smoothing out the latest outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to account for recent demand variability. The backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to ensure the service level targets are met despite the lead time instability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the SKU chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory and 431 units in-transit. Over the last 10 periods, demand has averaged 107.7 units, which is a sustained increase compared to the initial pre-game samples. Specifically, the last 10 periods of demand are: 85, 129, 132, 108, 128, 101, 111, 134, 77, 72. While demand dropped slightly in the last two periods (77, 72), the overall mean remains higher than the initial stats. Lead time history shows high volatility with actual values of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. This averages to 2.2 periods. To protect against the stockout observed in Period 10 and account for the pipeline (431 units) against the expected lead time, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of ~2.2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the sustained higher demand regime and its associated volatility since Period 1.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 10 and 11. Demand is stable but on the higher side of our previous regime, averaging ~104 units over the last 11 periods. However, lead time is the primary source of volatility. We have seen lead times of 1 period (P3, P8 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). Currently, orders from P2 (135 units), P6 (98 units), P9 (141 units), P10 (57 units), and P11 (12 units) are in-transit. Looking at the history, the order from P2 is significantly overdue (10 periods since ordering), suggesting it may be a lost shipment. The order from P6 is also overdue (6 periods). To address this, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed. I will use a recent_N of 11 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full game history mean which is ~104. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock level covering L+1 (4) periods of demand (~416 units), which matches our pipeline inventory while acknowledging that some in-transit stock might be lost. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=11 ensures the safety stock accounts for the recent demand variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current state shows 130 units on-hand and 268 units in-transit. Analyzing historical lead times: We've seen arrivals with lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods. The average lead time is approximately 2.3 periods, but the most frequent lead time (mode) is 3. I will set L to 3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts given the volatility. Regarding demand, the last 4 periods (P9-P12) show a significant drop (77, 72, 99, 68; mean ~79) compared to the previous regime (P4-P8 mean ~116). This looks like a new demand regime or a cyclical dip. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower mean (~79) and adjust the inventory levels downward to minimize holding costs while the lead time remains uncertain. Using L=3 means the backend calculates base_stock for (1+L)=4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~116 to ~79 units/period (-32%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a demand regime that shifted downwards around Period 9. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 80 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84). We currently have 46 units on hand and 268 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for sustained arrivals. Given the high pipeline inventory (268 units) relative to the current demand (~80/period), we risk high holding costs if we set the base stock too high. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 explicitly to reflect the observed delay and ensure the pipeline inventory is correctly accounted for by the OR backend, which subtracts 'in-transit' from the calculated base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift. Starting at Period 9, demand dropped from an average of ~116 to ~83 over the last 6 periods (77, 72, 99, 68, 84, 111). I am setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime. Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2, but actual observations show significant volatility (1, 2, and 3 periods). Specifically, P1, P4, P5, P9, and P11 all had LT=3, while P3 and P8 had LT=1, and P10 had LT=2. The most recent completed delivery (P11) had a lead time of 3. Given the frequent occurrences of LT=3 and current stockout (on-hand is 0), I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the longer cycle and builds a sufficient buffer to handle the current replenishment delay. In-transit inventory is 283 units (from P12, P13, P14), which exceeds the expected target, so the OR backend will likely order 0 this period as we wait for these to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed demand regime (P9-P14) average is ~85 units/period; Lead time is frequently 3 periods (5 out of 8 observed arrivals), necessitating a more conservative L=3 setting.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 9-15) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 85 units per period. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and volatility regime. Lead time continues to be volatile and frequently hits 3 periods (6 out of 10 arrivals have had LT=2 or 3). Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are 346 units in transit, the system is waiting for several orders (including the large Period 2 order and others from P6 onwards). To protect against stockouts given the observed lead time of 3, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend's target inventory calculation covers the necessary period depth (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Periods 9-15 average demand is 85.0 units/period (std ~16.5). Lead time is consistently volatile with a mode of 3 (60% of arrivals >= 2 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0, while 366 units are in-transit. Historical analysis confirms a demand regime shift at Period 9: the average demand from Period 9 to 16 is ~78.1 units, significantly lower than the ~116 units observed previously. Period 16 showed a particularly low demand of 28, which might be an outlier or a further downward trend, but for now, I will stick to the Period 9 regime average. Lead time remains volatile but frequently hits 3 periods, so I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient window. I'm using N=8 for mu_hat (Periods 9-16) to focus on this lower demand regime. The high pipeline (366 units) suggests that we are currently over-extended compared to a demand of ~80/period, so the OR backend should scale back ordering once the current 'In-transit' units begin arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Period 9 to 16 average demand is 78.1 units/period (down from previous ~116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) with a significant pipeline (319 units), although the pipeline includes potentially lost orders from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 6 (98 units). Recent arrivals (Period 17) confirm that lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 9; the average demand from Period 9 to Period 17 is approximately 74.3 units, compared to the earlier average of ~116. However, the last two periods (P16: 28, P17: 43) suggest a further potential downward trend or increased volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the regime starting from Period 9, providing a stable basis for the lower demand level while accounting for the recent variability. Given the frequent observation of 3-period lead times (the mode of the distribution), setting L=3 remains the safest approach to prevent stockouts while accounting for the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand regime from P9-P17 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~74.3 units/period (compared to ~116 previously). Lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant decline. From Period 9 to Period 18, the average demand has dropped to approximately 71.3 units/period, down from the earlier average of ~116. Furthermore, the last three periods (P16-P18) show an even lower localized average of ~37 units. This suggest we are in a low-demand regime. Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2, but actual observations show a range of 1 to 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent mode. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. However, in-transit inventory is high (336 units), resulting from a large order in Period 15 (86 units) and others. These units are overdue or pending. Setting L=3 explicitly accounts for the frequent delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the lower demand regime since Period 9 while smoothing the recent extreme lows. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a significantly lower mean; average demand from P9-P18 is ~71 units. The last three periods (P16-P18) show a potential further dip to ~37 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant downward shift starting around Period 16. While the average demand between Period 9 and Period 15 was approximately 85 units, the last four periods (P16-P19) have seen a drop to an average of 42 units (28, 43, 40, 57). Although P19 saw a slight recovery to 57, it is far below the previous regime of ~75-80. I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new lower-demand regime. Regarding lead time, the historical data shows high volatility (1 to 3 periods), with 3 periods being the most frequent for successful arrivals (7 out of 11 recorded arrivals had LT >= 2, and 6 had LT = 3). Setting L=3 is necessary to account for this lag. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a total of 336 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P18). The OR backend's capped policy will help prevent over-ordering given the large pipeline relative to the new lower demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: Mean demand dropped from ~85 to ~42 units/period (-50% approx) based on the last 4 periods of data.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Starting around Period 16, demand significantly dropped from an average of ~85 units to ~42 units per period (Periods 16-20: 28, 43, 40, 57, 43; Mean = 42.2). The current 'In-transit' quantity is 336 units, which is extremely high (nearly 8 periods of coverage) relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods. Given the high pipeline and low recent demand, the goal is to prevent further over-ordering while the backend clears the existing 336 units. Setting L=3 explicitly accounts for the observed delays, while mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N=5 to capture the new lower demand level (avg ~42), which helps the OR backend throttle new orders until the pipeline inventory is consumed.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward regime shift. Since Period 16, demand has been consistently lower: 28, 43, 40, 57, 43, and 33 units. The average for this 6-period regime is approximately 40.7 units/period. The current 'In-transit' pipeline is extremely high at 336 units, which is approximately 8 periods of demand at the current rate (336 / 40.7 \u2248 8.2). This inventory is likely the result of orders placed in periods 15 (86 units), 18 (17 units), and potentially older missing/delayed shipments or the system reporting total pipeline. Given that 336 units far exceeds the necessary base stock to cover even a 3-period lead time (expected base stock would be around 4 * 41 = 164 units), no new orders are needed. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 captures the low demand drop, and setting L=3 accounts for the frequent lead time volatility observed in history. The OR backend will see that (Pipeline 336 > Base Stock) and will naturally order 0 units, protecting the profit from high holding costs while awaiting the arrival of current transit units to clear the backorder/stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand dropped to ~41 units/period (based on P16-P21). Lead time remains volatile but frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 16, averaging roughly 41 units per period (P16-P22 data: 28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 336 units in-transit (orders from P15 and P18/P19 appear delayed or pending, though the prompt shows total in-transit). Lead time has been consistently volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to ensure the backend accounts for a 4-period horizon (L+1). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (approx 41 units * 4 periods = 164). Given the 336 units in transit, the base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) will naturally result in a 0-unit order this period, which is appropriate as the system is currently over-supplied relative to the new demand level.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and significant stockouts occurring since Period 18. Historical lead times have been highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P14). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual mode is 3. However, a major concern is the 'In-transit' quantity of 336 units. Since no orders were placed in Periods 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23, and the total ordered units from Period 15 to 18 (the last active order periods) only sum to 123 (86+20+0+17), the '336 units in-transit' indicates that many historical orders (likely from Period 13 and earlier) are severely delayed or stuck. Demand shifted around Period 16 to a lower regime; the average demand from Period 16 to 23 is approximately 41.1 units per period. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (41.1 mean) while the backend tries to resolve the massive pipeline against the required base stock.

Carry-over insight: Critical pipeline congestion: In-transit inventory (336) far exceeds recent order history, indicating severe lead time extensions or backlogs from earlier periods. Demand regime remains stabilized at ~41 units/period since Period 16.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of severe supply chain failure. As of Period 25, there is a total in-transit inventory of 336 units, which is significantly higher than any individual order placed in the history, suggesting that historical 'concluded' orders (like those from P15 onwards) or even earlier unaccounted units have not arrived. Specifically, orders from Period 15 (86 units) and Period 18 (17 units) are long overdue. The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 42 units/period since Period 16 (P16-P24 mean: 42.5). Due to the massive 'pipeline inventory' of 336 units being tracked by the OR backend (which is roughly 8 periods of supply at current demand rates), any positive base_stock calculation would still result in a zero order because the pipeline (336) exceeds the target. To prevent further inflating this backlog and to wait for the resolution of 'lost' or 'stalled' shipments, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the frequent late arrivals) and use the recent demand regime (last 9 periods) to guide \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. No new order will be generated by the OR backend until the pipeline is cleared or arrivals occur.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall: No arrivals have been recorded since Period 17, resulting in a massive in-transit 'ghost' inventory of 336 units. Demand remains stable at a lower regime of ~42 units/period since Period 16.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has encountered a severe stall. No arrivals have been recorded since Period 17 (9 periods ago), despite 336 units being 'In-transit'. These units originated from orders placed between Periods 2 and 18. Specifically, orders from P2 (135), P6 (98), P13 (0), P15 (86), and P18 (17) are likely trapped in this backlog, as they have exceeded even the worst observed lead time (3 periods). Demand has remained in a low, stable regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 44 units/period (P16-P25: 28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36, 54, 56). Given that the current 'In-transit' quantity (336) is sufficient to cover ~7.6 periods of demand (336 / 44), ordering more units would only increase holding costs once the logjam clears. I will continue to hold orders (set order to 0 via L and mu_hat) until arrivals resume and the pipeline inventory is drawn down. I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to signal to the OR backend that no further ordering is required while the pipeline is so heavily bloated relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall continues: No arrivals since Period 17; 'In-transit' units (336) represent a 7+ period supply and are considered 'ghost' inventory until arrivals resume.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains stalled for chips(Regular), with no arrivals confirmed since Period 17 (10 periods ago). Consequently, the backend 'In-transit' metric shows 336 units\u2014largely consisting of an order from Period 2 that was never delivered and subsequent orders that seem lost or indefinitely delayed. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 47 units/period (average of P16-P26 is 47.8). Due to the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely prevent any new orders from being placed. However, given that we have 0 stock and the in-transit units are likely lost, I must set the lead time explicitly to 2 (the promised value) to avoid inflating the base stock calculation, and focus on the most recent demand regime (N=11) to accurately reflect the lower volume (~48 units). Maintaining small N for sigma_hat captures the recent variability in this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall continues: No arrivals since Period 17; 'In-transit' units (336) include a massive Period 2 order (135 units) and other subsequent orders totaling 7+ periods of supply that haven't arrived. Demand regime P16-P26 is stable at a mean of ~48 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain stall continues with no arrivals since Period 17. The 'In-transit' inventory of 336 units includes a significant order of 135 units from Period 2 (now 26 periods overdue) and subsequent orders that have effectively disappeared. For OR purposes, this 336 pipeline inventory is 'ghost' stock that prevents the engine from ordering if L is set low, because the engine assumes these units will arrive. To force the OR engine to place a new order to cover demand, I will set L to an 'explicit' high value of 10. This effectively signals a massive lead time delay and increases the target stock level. Demand from Period 16-27 has shifted slightly higher recently (averaging ~52 over the last 5 periods), so I will use a 'recent_N' of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since P16 while accounting for the recent uptick. This strategy aims to overcome the pipeline blockage by recalibrating the inventory targets high enough to trigger a fresh order.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall continues as of Period 28: No arrivals since Period 17; Pipeline inventory (336 units) contains extremely overdue orders (e.g., P2 order) and is effectively 'ghost' inventory. Demand regime (P16-P27) mean has slightly increased to ~51 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of severe disruption, with no arrivals recorded since Period 17 (12 periods ago). The pipeline inventory of 411 units includes the 135-unit order from Period 2 and several others that are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time. However, I must assume some goods will eventually arrive or that new orders will be fulfilled. Demand has undergone several shifts: a pre-game average of ~96, a peak regime around ~116 (P1-P8), a lower regime of ~85 (P9-P15), and a recently stabilized regime of ~51 (P16-P28). The mean demand over the last 13 periods (P16-P28) is 49.3 units. Given the extreme lead time uncertainty, I'm setting L to an explicit value of 3 (the observed mode) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for sufficient coverage. I am using recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P16-P28). I continue to place small orders (like in P28) to probe the supply line despite the high 'In-transit' count, which is likely comprised of lost or stale shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall persists: 12 consecutive periods (P18-P29) with zero arrivals. Most pipeline inventory (specifically the 336 units ordered before Period 17) is likely lost or severely backlogged. Demand regime (P16-P28) is confirmed stable at a mean of ~49.3 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30. The supply chain has experienced a massive stall with no arrivals since Period 17 (13 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' quantity of 411 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory, including a Period 2 order (135 units) that is now 28 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. Demand from Period 16 to Period 29 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 51.2 units per period (N=14). Despite the high pipeline inventory of 411 units, the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent ordering if it considers the full pipeline. However, to maintain the desired service level (calculated q = 0.8), we must account for the fact that the 336 units ordered prior to Period 17 are likely never arriving. I will set L=3 based on historical volatile lead times and use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Period 16 demand regime. I am not placing a new order because the recent order of 75 units (Period 28) is still within a reasonable 'extended' lead time window and should ideally arrive soon to clear the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall persists: 13 consecutive periods (P18-P30) with zero arrivals. Total 'ghost' inventory is likely 336 units (all orders placed prior to Period 18). Demand regime (P16-P29) mean is stable at ~51.2 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain stall has finally broken: 75 units ordered on Period 28 arrived in Period 30 (lead_time = 2), representing the first arrival since Period 17 correctly observed. This confirms that while the 'ghost' inventory of 336 units (placed before P28) is still likely lost or severely backlogged, newer orders can specifically bypass the logjam. The demand regime from Period 16 to Period 30 shows a mean of approximately 53.9 units/period, with recent periods (P26-P30) showing a slight upward trend (avg 71.2). I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent uptick (approx 70 units/period) and L to 2 (promised/recent observed) to avoid over-ordering while the status of the 336 units remains unknown. If the 336 units arrive suddenly, we face high holding costs; if we don't order, we lose sales. I will assume L=2 and target the recent higher demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall broken at Period 30: Order from P28 arrived with LT=2, suggesting new orders may process normally despite the 336 units of 'ghost' inventory remaining in-transit from before P18. Demand regime (P26-P30) has increased to an average of ~71 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain stall was broken in Period 30 by an order placed in Period 28 (LT=2). However, the 'In-transit' inventory still displays 336 units, which represent orders from Period 17 and earlier (specifically including 135 units from Period 2). These units are officially 'ghost inventory' and are unlikely to arrive, but because the OR backend includes all in-transit units in its base-stock calculation, it will stop ordering if these units aren't accounted for. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have missed demand for 14 consecutive periods (except for Period 30). Demand had a significant regime shift starting around Period 26, increasing from ~40 to an average of ~71 units/period (P26-P31: 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 336 'ghost' units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base_stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 71 units/period (~213 units) plus a safety buffer, then add the 336 units of stalled inventory to that total. This ensures that (Base Stock - 336) results in a positive order quantity that reflects current demand needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean demand increased from ~41 to ~71 units/period (+73%) based on P26-P31. Lead time for new orders confirmed as 2 periods (P28 order arrived P30).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 26. The average demand for the most recent period (P26-P32) is approximately 73 units per period (77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79). The 'ghost' inventory of 336 units (ordered before Period 18) is still showing in 'In-transit' but has not arrived for 15 periods, implying these units are likely lost. However, the order from Period 28 arrived on time (LT=2), suggesting that current supply chain operations have normalized. Despite the large 'In-transit' figure of 563 (which includes the 336 lost units and the 227 units ordered last period), I must set parameters to ensure the OR backend places orders based on the new demand level. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~73) and L=2 based on the most recent successful delivery. High sigma_hat with N=7 is used to account for the recent demand volatility (range 47-92).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~41 to ~73 units/period (+78%) based on P26-P32. Supply chain for NEW orders appears to have normalized at LT=2, while 336 units ordered before Period 18 remain 'ghost' inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P33), the demand mean has increased to approximately 78.1 units per period (77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79, 116). Lead times for new orders have normalized at a shorter duration (observed LT=2 in P30 and LT=1 in P33), averaging 1.5 periods across the last two successful arrivals. Consequently, I am setting L to explicit 2 to bridge the gap between recent performance and the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=8 to capture this higher demand regime that started at P26. The 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from orders prior to Period 18 are ignored for planning purposes, as they have not arrived for 16 periods and would otherwise suppress the OR backend's order calculation, leading to stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P26-P33) mean confirmed at ~78.1 units/period. Supply chain for NEW orders has resumed, showing a recent lead time average of 1.5 periods (last 2 arrivals).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 26, moving from a low of ~42 to a significantly higher average. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P26-P34) is 75.0 units/period (77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79, 116, 79). The lead time for new orders has normalized, with recent arrivals at LT=2 and LT=1 since the supply chain stall broke. However, the 'In-transit' figure remains at 336 units, which represents orders placed before Period 18 that have never arrived (the 'ghost' inventory). Because the OR engine uses pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, and it doesn't know these 336 units are likely lost, it will stop ordering unless I adjust parameters. To bypass this, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. With L=2 (promised), that's 3 periods. 3 * 75 = 225. Since 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' (336 + 32 = 368) already exceeds any reasonable base stock, the OR engine would normally order 0. To force an order to maintain service levels now that the stall is broken, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'ghost' inventory plus current needs. However, the system's 'cap' also limits orders. To ensure we have stock for the coming periods despite the 'ghost' inventory, I'll set mu_hat to cover current demand plus the ghost offset.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P26-P34) mean confirmed at 75.0 units/period. Supply chain for NEW orders is functional with LT 1-2, while 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from P2-P17 remain lost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable with a mean of 75.0 units/period (Periods 26-35 average: 752/10 = 75.2). Lead times for new orders have normalized at 1-2 periods. The 336 units ordered before Period 18 are confirmed lost ('ghost' inventory), so the effective in-transit pipeline for current planning is total in-transit (547) minus those ghost units (336), which equals 211 units (representing the order from Period 35). This means we have one period of forecast demand covered in the pipeline for arrival in P36 or P37. Setting L=2 to be conservative given historical volatility. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*75.2 = 225.6 using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 78.5 units/period (P26-P36). The most recent demand samples are 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79, 116, 79, 84, 83. The supply chain has partially recovered: while 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from orders before Period 18 remain lost/backlogged, recent orders (P28, P32) arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods, respectively. Consequently, I am using L=2 (promised) as the functional lead time for new orders, but I must account for the fact that the 'In-transit' figure of 547 is misleading. It includes the 336 lost units and the 211 units ordered in Period 35 (which should arrive in P37 or P38). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current demand without being suppressed by the 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 11-period regime (N=11) and maintaining L=2 to reflect the observed functional lead time for new shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed stable at ~78.5 units/period. Functional lead time for new orders is 1-2 periods, while 336 units of pipeline inventory from P2-P17 remain lost/stalled.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 78.5 units. The most recent samples (P33-P37: 116, 79, 84, 83, 82) support a mean around 88.8, but the longer window since P26 is more reliable at ~78.5. Lead time for viable orders has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (P32 order took 1, P35 order took 2). I will set L=2 for safety. The 'ghost' inventory of 336 units remains in the in-transit field but hasn't arrived in 20 periods; since the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these ghost units. Expected base stock for L=2 and mean 78.5 is roughly 236 units (3 periods of coverage). However, with 336 in-transit already being subtracted by the backend, a standard calculation would result in zero orders. To force an order that covers the current period and lead time despite the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to 480 (covering roughly 3 periods of demand + 240 units to neutralize the ghost units) and sigma_hat to 40 to maintain a high service level given the volatility and previous stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~78.5 units/period. Functional lead time for new orders is 1-2 periods. In-transit 'ghost' inventory of 336 units from P2-P17 is officially considered lost but remains in the pipeline count.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~78.5 units. Recent lead times for new orders (P28, P32, P35) have been 2, 1, and 2 periods respectively, averaging 1.67 periods. Based on this, I use L=2 (promised/mode) and mu_hat based on the last 13 periods (P26-P38) to capture the current regime mean of ~78.1. Sigma_hat is also based on this recent regime. Crucially, the 'In-transit' count of 376 includes 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed before Period 18 that are highly unlikely to arrive. The OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)] will essentially block new orders if the full pipeline (376) is used. Since the ghost inventory is 336 and current functional pipeline is 40 (from P38), the backend sees 376. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime, I provide the correct target levels. However, I must note that if the OR engine does not provide an order due to the ghost inventory, I may need to use 'explicit' values in future periods to force orders if on-hand drops too low.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~78.5 units/period. The functional lead time for new orders since the supply chain 'unfroze' at Period 28 oscillates between 1 and 2 periods (actuals observed: 2, 1, 2, 1). However, the in-transit 'ghost' inventory of 336 units (ordered between P2-P17) remains lost in the system. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (336) from the base stock calculation, it would result in zero orders if not addressed. To force the engine to place an order, I must set the L and mu_hat parameters high enough to exceed the ghost inventory. A base stock target of roughly (L+1) * mu_hat should ideally be higher than 336. Setting L to 3 (to be conservative with the mode of observed lead times) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 400 (roughly 100 per period for 4 periods) ensures the system accounts for demand while the pipeline remains clogged with lost units. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (approx 15-20 units), scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~78 units/period since Period 26 (P26-P40 mean: 78.4). Recent supply chain behavior for 'new' orders (post-stall) shows efficient lead times of 1-2 periods (average 1.5). There remains 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed before Period 18 that are effectively lost but still contribute to the system's 'in-transit' calculation. To account for this, \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calculated using the recent stable demand regime (last 15 periods), and L is set to 2 to reflect the current functional lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and current real pipeline inventory (excluding the 336 ghost units) is 83 units (from Period 40). Setting L=2, mu_hat=recent_15, and sigma_hat=recent_15 allows the OR engine to target a base stock that covers approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is confirmed stable with a mean of 78.4 units/period (P26-P40). Functional lead time for new orders remains between 1-2 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable, with an average demand of approximately 78.4 units/period (P26-P41). Recent demand (P33-P41) is very consistent, ranging between 69 and 84 (excluding the P33 outlier). Lead times for new orders have normalized to 1-2 periods. However, there is a significant 'ghost' inventory of 336 units from orders placed before Period 18 that are likely lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' total (currently 419). Specifically, 419 - 83 (P40 order) = 336 units are stalled. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat. Following the logic of base_stock = (1+L)*demand_mean + z*sigma, for L=2 and mean=78, we need a base stock of ~234 plus safety stock. Since the backend subtracts the full 419 in-transit units from its target, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or account for the lost units. I will set L=3 to reflect the historical volatility and mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand plus the stalled units to ensure the capped policy allows for a replenishment order.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 78.4 units per period. Recent periods 41 and 42 show slightly lower demand (69 and 42), but given the historical volatility, I will stick to the established regime mean (~78) to avoid under-stocking. The lead time for functional orders has normalized between 1 and 2 periods (mode of recent arrivals is 1-2). I will set L to 2 to be safe. Pipeline inventory is currently 607 units. However, this count is heavily distorted by 336 units of 'ghost' inventory ordered between Periods 2-17 that are confirmed lost/stalled and haven't arrived in over 25 periods. To ensure the OR backend places necessary orders despite this inflated pipeline count, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on (L+1) periods of demand (3 * 78 = 234) plus a safety stock buffer (z*sigma). Since on-hand is 0 and valid in-transit is 271 (orders from P40 and P42), the total system inventory (0 + 271) is technically sufficient for the immediate lead time, but I must remain vigilant as the ghost inventory (336) persists in the backend's calculation. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=16 to cover the stable regime since Period 26.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~75.5 units/period (P26-P43). Recent lead times for functional orders have been 2, 1, 2, 1, 3 periods, averaging 1.8 periods. Period 43 saw the arrival of the Period 40 order (LT=3), leaving the Period 42 order (188 units) in-transit along with the long-standing 'ghost' inventory of 336 units. Total in-transit is 524 (336 ghost + 188 functional). Since the backend OR uses pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the presence of 336 lost units severely suppresses new ordering. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) periods of demand plus the 336 units that the backend incorrectly assumes are coming. With L=3 (to be conservative given recent volatility) and expected demand of 75.5, the required base stock is approx (1+3)*75.5 = 302 plus a safety stock. However, since the engine subtracts 524 from its target, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure a positive order is placed if needed. Current on-hand is 7. Demand is stable, so I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=18 to cover the P26-P43 regime) and L=3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable with a mean of approximately 78.4 units/period, though Period 44 saw a spike to 137 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 524 units is misleading because it includes 336 units from orders placed before Period 18 that are confirmed lost/stalled ('ghost inventory'). The functional in-transit inventory consists of orders from P40 (83 units, arrived P43) and P42 (188 units). Excluding the 336 lost units, the active pipeline is actually 188 units (the P42 order). Lead times for functional orders remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (mode 2). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 336 'ghost' units and accounts for current demand, I am using explicit parameters. L is set to 2 (recent average). mu_hat is set to 235, which represents (1+L) * ~78.4, providing enough coverage for the lead time plus current period. sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect recent volatility and the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed demand spike in P44 (137 units) against the stable P26-P43 average (~78 units). Total 'In-transit' (524) still includes 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from P2-P17 that will likely never arrive.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is stable at a mean of approximately 78.5 units/period, despite a brief outlier in Period 44 (137 units). Period 45 demand returned to 94, consistent with the higher end of the current regime. Lead times for functional orders vary between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode around 2-3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 94 units. The 'In-transit' count of 336 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed between Periods 2 and 17 that are confirmed lost/stalled and will not arrive. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order, and the backend 'sees' 336 units in transit, it will not place new orders unless the base stock exceeds 336 + on-hand. Since our target base stock for a lead time of 2-3 periods is significantly lower than 430, the OR engine will continue to produce zero orders while we bleed on-hand inventory. To force an order and bypass the ghost inventory bottleneck, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat = (78.5 * (1 + 2)) + 336 = 571.5. This effectively 'offsets' the 336 ghost units so the backend calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) remains positive and reflective of our actual needs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Current on-hand inventory is 55 units. Total In-transit is 511 units, but 336 of these are 'ghost' inventory from Periods 2-17 that are considered lost. Effectively, active pipeline inventory is 175 units (ordered P46). The demand regime starting from Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~78 units/period. Period 44 saw a spike (137), but Period 46 returned to a lower level (39). Lead times for functional orders remain volatile between 1-3 periods. I will set L to 2 (recent average) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the stabilized regime since Period 26. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the current 78-unit demand environment while ignoring the misleading 'ghost' inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The demand regime starting at Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~78 units/period. Recent observed demand has fluctuated (137 in P44, 39 in P46, 82 in P47), but the underlying process remains consistent. The 'In-transit' inventory is 511 units, which includes 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed between Period 2 and Period 17 that are effectively lost. Therefore, the 'active' pipeline is 511 - 336 = 175 units (the order placed in Period 46). Functional lead time for new orders remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2. Based on the game end nearing (Period 50), we must ensure we cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (P48, P49, P50). Setting L=2 and using recent_N (N=22, covering P26-P47) for demand parameters will stabilize the base stock target. The OR backend's cap and the existing 'ghost' inventory logic mean we must be careful; however, since total active pipeline + on-hand (0 + 175 = 175) is roughly equal to 2.2 periods of demand, current settings should maintain stock through the end of the game without excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Active pipeline is 175 units; the remaining 336 units of 'In-transit' are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from P2-P17. Demand regime (P26-P47) mean remains ~78 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The demand regime starting from Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~78 units/period. The current in-transit inventory is 511 units, which consists of 336 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2-P17 that are lost) and 175 units ordered in Period 46. Based on the functional lead time of 1-3 periods, the P46 order (175 units) should arrive during Period 48 or 49. As of the start of Period 49, it has not arrived yet. Since the game ends after Period 50, and the lead time is at least 1-2 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 50 or 51. An arrival in Period 51 is useless. However, even if it arrives in Period 50, the current pipeline of 175 units (which should arrive in P49 or P50) is sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~78 for Period 49 and ~78 for Period 50. Total expected demand = 156. Pipeline (real) = 175. Ordering more would only increase holding costs if the ghost inventory were to miraculously arrive or if demand underperforms. Therefore, I will set L=2 and maintain the current demand forecast of ~78 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision point. The current 'In-transit' inventory is 511 units, which includes 336 units of 'ghost' inventory from orders placed between Periods 2 and 17 that are confirmed as lost/stalled and will never arrive. The active pipeline consists of 175 units ordered at Period 46. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 78.4 units per period. Recent lead times for functional orders have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). Given this is the final period, the goal is to maximize the final period's reward, but there are no more decisions to influence future periods after this. However, the OR backend requires parameters for this final cycle. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 26 and set L=2 as the most representative functional lead time. On-hand is 0, so the system will look at the 175 active units in transit versus the calculated base stock.
