If P1's 140 units arrive during P4 (L=3), they will be visible at the start of P5. Current demand is high and we have zero stock, leading to significant lost sales. \n4.

Because actual lead time frequently hits 3 periods, I must ensure inventory coverage for at least L+1 = 4 periods to avoid stockouts during longer delivery cycles.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (P1-P9) averages 109 units/period. The latest demand (P9) was lower (77), but previous periods were consistently above 100. I will use a conservative average of 110 units/period for planning.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 104 units. In-transit is 400 units (composed of P6: 115 units [overdue, likely lost or very delayed], and P9: 150 units). Since P6 (ordered 4 periods ago) hasn't arrived while P7 and P8 have, I am treating the 115 units from P6 as lost/unreliable. This leaves 150 units (P9) as the only reliable pipeline.\n4. Target Stock: 4 periods of demand (4 * 110) = 440 units. Current reliable total (On-hand 104 + P9 150) = 254 units. Shortfall = 440 - 254 = 186 units.\n5. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on a promised lead time (2) and likely includes the P6 shipment in its pipeline.

Demand Analysis: A significant regime shift was identified at Period 16. Demand dropped from an average of ~95 to ~35. The most recent three periods show demand of 28, 43, and 40 (average 37). 3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 192 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is 350, composed of orders from P15 (100), P16 (100 - wait, P16 arrived in P17), P17 (0), P18 (0). Re-checking history: P15 (100) is outstanding. P16 (100) arrived in P17. P14 (50) arrived in P17. Wait, checking the 'In-transit' field: it says 350. This implies P15(100) + P16(100? No, P16 arrived) + P11(50? No, P11 arrived). Let's look at the orders not yet concluded: P15(100), P16(actually arrived), P17(0), P18(0).

This leaves an effective pipeline of 0 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift occurred around Period 16. Previous average demand was ~95; current average (P16-P22) is ~42. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the calculation of the 350 units in transit as 'live' inventory. 4. **Strategy**: With 10 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0 (treating the 200 old units as lost), I need to cover demand for the review period plus lead time (1+3 = 4 periods). At an average demand of 42, target stock should be ~168 units. 168 - 10 (on-hand) = 158 units.

However, based on Carry-over Insights and historical logs: Period 15 (100 units) and Period 16 (100 units) orders are effectively lost (8+ periods elapsed). This leaves 300 'real' in-transit units: Period 17-22 had 0 orders, Period 23 ordered 150 units, and Period 24 (current) has an OR recommendation of 0. Upon deeper inspection of the 'In-transit' jump from 350 to 500 in Period 23, it appears some older 'lost' units remain in the system count. The only active, reliable order is the 150 units from Period 23.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand has shifted from ~95 to ~42 since Period 16.

Total reliable pipeline is 150 units (ordered Period 23). Expected arrival for Period 23's order is Period 25 or 26 (avg lead time ~2-3). \n\n4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: OR recommends 0 because it sees 500 units in the pipeline and low demand. However, with 0 on-hand and a likely 2-period gap before the Period 23 order arrives, there is a stockout risk for Period 24 and 25. \n\n5. **Strategy**: I will override the OR recommendation of 0. I need to cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1). At ~42 units/period, 3 periods of coverage requires ~126 units. Since 150 units are already coming in Period 23's order, but won't arrive until Period 25/26, I need a small buffer to bridge the immediate gap and account for the high loss rate of shipments.

Pre-P16 average demand was ~95; post-P16 average demand is ~42 units.

Specifically, orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 16, 24, 25, 29, 30, and likely 37 have never arrived, totaling approximately 825 lost units.

Our current on-hand inventory is low at 24 units. With a lead time varying between 1-3 periods, we need to ensure enough effective pipeline to cover demand over 3-4 periods (~320 units). Subtracting the one order that just arrived (Period 40) from our effective pipeline calculation, and accounting for the 100-unit orders from Periods 41, 42, and 43 which are still within the plausible arrival window, we have enough expected stock to cover the immediate horizon.

However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, approximately 825 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P16, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). Therefore, the 'Effective Pipeline' is 1125 - 825 = 300 units. These 300 units represent the orders from P42, P43, and P44 (100 units each).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has been volatile, with a significant spike to 137 units in Period 44. The historical average in this higher-demand regime is roughly 80-90 units, but recent variance suggests we should prepare for higher peaks.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it misinterprets the 1125 in-transit units as actual incoming stock.

The effective pipeline is therefore only 200 units (Orders from P44 and P45). With current inventory at 106 units and demand averaging ~78 units over the last 10 periods (with recent spikes reaching 137), the total effective supply is approximately 306 units.

Shipments from P2, P6, P15, P16, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P37 (totaling 825 units) have never arrived and are well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods.

The 'conclude' messages show Period 40 arrived in P43 (LT=3), P41 in P44 (LT=3), and P42/P43 in P45 (LT=3 and LT=2 respectively). Recent orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 (all 100 units) are currently in-transit.\n\n2. **Pipeline and Lost Orders**: The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1225 units. However, consistent history across the last 40 periods confirms that 825 units (from P2, P6, P15, P16, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 1225 - 825 = 400 units. These 400 units correspond to the orders placed in Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47 (100 units each).\n\n3. **Inventory and Demand Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has been volatile: 76, 137, 94, 39, 82 (average ~86). Demand tends to spike between 80-130 units. We are at Period 48 of 50. Orders placed now (P48) with a lead time of 2-3 periods will arrive at P50 or beyond. The primary objective is to satisfy demand for P48, P49, and P50.\n\n4. **Strategy**: The effective pipeline (400 units) is expected to arrive over the next few periods (P48-P50). Since P44 and P45 orders (200 units total) are already past the 2rd period since order, they are likely to arrive in P48 or P49. With 400 units coming for 3 remaining periods of demand (estimated max ~300 units), we are already over-covered.

However, history shows that 825 units in that pipeline are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P15, P16, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P37). The effective pipeline is actually 1225 - 825 = 400 units, representing orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged approximately 81 units over the last 10 periods. For Period 49 and Period 50, we expect total remaining demand of ~162 units. Although the effective pipeline (400 units) technically covers this, actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. Given that no arrivals occurred in P46, P47, or P48, there is a risk that the P44/P45 orders are delayed or also lost. However, since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in P50 at the earliest (if lead time is 1) or P51/P52 (if lead time is 2-3). Since arrivals happen AFTER the decision phase and demand resolution, a P49 order arriving in P50 could only satisfy P50 demand. However, the existing effective pipeline of 400 units is already significantly higher than the expected demand for the final two periods. Ordering more would likely only increase holding costs if they arrive, or provide no benefit if they arrive after the game ends.
