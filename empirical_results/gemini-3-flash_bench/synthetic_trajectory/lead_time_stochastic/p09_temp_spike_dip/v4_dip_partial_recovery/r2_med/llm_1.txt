Given the lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 (L=2) and be available for demand in Period 4. I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 with current stock, but since on-hand is 0, Periods 1 and 2 will unfortunately face stockouts. To prepare for Period 3 and 4, I will order based on the average historical demand (approx 95) multiplied by the cover period (L+1 = 3), while being slightly aggressive due to the recent upward trend.

To reach the target of 320, I need to order 30 units, but since demand has frequently spiked above 90 and I have 0 on-hand, I will order 80 units to ensure service levels and account for the high probability of stockouts in the immediate periods due to the 3-period lead time delay.",
