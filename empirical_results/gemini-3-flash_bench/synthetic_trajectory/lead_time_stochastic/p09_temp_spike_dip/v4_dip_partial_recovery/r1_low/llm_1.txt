I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 with this order plus my current inventory, but since current on-hand is 0, Periods 1 and 2 will unfortunately result in stockouts before any replenishment can arrive.

The current viable pipeline consists of: P37 (40 units - highly suspect as it is 6 periods old), P40 (80 units), P41 (75 units), and P42 (80 units). Given that P37's 40 units have not arrived after 6 periods, they are now likely lost as well (new lost total = 716). This means the active viable In-transit is P40-P42 = 235 units. Current On-hand is 46. Total viable inventory (Oh + In-transit) = 281. Using a target of (L+1) * Demand where L=3, I need roughly (3+1) * 70 = 280 units to cover the lead time window.
