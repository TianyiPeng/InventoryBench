In-transit is 248 (P2: 148 units, P4: 100 units). Total Pipeline = 363. However, the P2 order is significantly overdue (ordered P2, now P6 decision), suggesting it might be lost or stuck. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 20 units is based on the promised lead time (L=2) and includes the P2 order in its pipeline calculation. Given the demand surge and the uncertainty of the P2 shipment, I need to secure more inventory. If P2 is lost, my effective pipeline drops to 100.

In-transit reflects 348 units (comprised of Period 2: 148, Period 4: 100, Period 5: 100). If Period 2 is lost, effective in-transit is only 200 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical samples show a shift. Periods 1-3 averaged ~80, but Periods 4-6 (using most recent demand) have averaged ~123 (106, 136, 128). This supports the carry-over insight of an upward shift toward ~130. 4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 41 units is too conservative because it assumes the 148 units from Period 2 will arrive and uses an average demand weighted by lower early values. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a revised mean of 130, I need ~390 units. With 0 on-hand and 200 reliable units in-transit, I need 190 total.

The system's 'In-transit' usually reflects all outstanding orders. 558 consists of the 498 lost units plus the 60 units *actually* in transit? No, In-transit=558 is exactly 498 (lost) + 60.

Demand has reached a new higher regime, averaging ~86 units over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), with a recent peak of 116. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated system 'In-transit' figure (808) which incorrectly assumes plenty of stock is coming.\n3. **Stockout Risk**: Based on the effective pipeline (180 units) and current demand (~85-90/period), the 180 units in transit will cover approximately the next 2 periods. Given the lead time volatility and risk of further losses, additional ordering is required to prevent a stockout in Period 38/39. \n4. **Final Strategy**: I will ignore the OR recommendation of 0.

To ensure coverage for the lead time plus the current period (L+1=3), and considering the recent average demand of ~88, we need safe coverage of roughly 264 units. Currently, our on-hand (37) + reliable pipeline (250) = 287 units. While this technically covers the requirement, the supplier's high loss rate and lead-time volatility necessitate maintaining a steady flow. The OR recommendation of 0 is rejected because it likely fails to account for the massive volume of lost units in the 'In-transit' figure, potentially leading to a stockout once the P35/P36 orders are consumed.

Subtracting these, the active pipeline is 220 units (P41: 70, P42: 60, P43: 80, P44: 10 - intended). Lead times remain volatile (1-3 periods).\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand is 0. Recent demand (P36-P43) averages ~73 units. Although there was a peak in the P30-P35 range, demand has stabilized at a moderate level. \n3. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 incorrectly assumes a massive pipeline (848). However, looking at the active pipeline (210 units total from P41, P42, P43), we have significant coverage. P41 (70 units) and P42 (60 units) should arrive in P44 or P45. A total active pipeline of 210 units covers roughly 3 periods of demand (~70 * 3 = 210). \n4. Adjustment: I will order a small quantity of 10 units to maintain a steady flow and account for potential variability, as the game ends at P50 and we want to avoid overstocking while ensuring we don't stock out during arrival gaps.",

Furthermore, the Period 42 order (60 units) has not arrived after 3 periods, although it's not yet officially 'lost' by my 4-period heuristic. Subtracting confirmed losses from the reported 'In-transit' of 788 leaves an effective pipeline of 160 units (P42: 60, P43: 80, P44: 10). Demand in Period 44 spiked to 137 units, significantly above the recent average of ~85. The OR recommendation of 0 is influenced by the inflated total in-transit figure and does not account for the losses. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline that arrives over the next 3 periods, I need to order to cover the remaining periods (45-50). Expected demand for the final 6 periods at an average of 85 units is ~510 units. Current effective pipeline is only 160 units.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 46 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 768 units, but historical tracking confirms that 628 of these units are permanently lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P16, and P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 140 units (10 from P44, 120 from P45, and 10 remaining from P43/other uncalculated arrivals). Arrivals have been inconsistent, with actual lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at an average demand of ~90 units, I need a total inventory position of 270 units. My current effective position is 46 (on-hand) + 130 (pipeline: P44 and P45 orders) = 176 units. Although the OR recommendation is 0 (likely due to the inflated/false pipeline figure), I must order to bridge the 94-unit gap (270 - 176).

  "rationale": "The game is approaching its conclusion (Period 48 of 50). My primary objective is to satisfy demand for the remaining periods while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs, as any inventory left after Period 50 is a loss. \n\n1. **Lead Time Inference**: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, with significant shipment loss risks (~20%+). \n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 968. However, this is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments totaling 628 units (P2: 148, P6: 120, P15: 110, P16: 120, P29: 130). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 340 units (P44: 10, P45: 120, P46: 100, P47: 100). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P45-P47) averaged ~71.6 units. Over a longer horizon (P37-P47), the average is ~77.5 units. At Period 48, there are only 3 demand cycles left (P48, P49, P50). \n4. **Pipeline Coverage**: \n   - Period 44 order (10 units) should arrive this period (P48) or next.\n   - Period 45 order (120 units) is expected P47-P49.\n   - Period 46 order (100 units) is expected P48-P50.\n   - Period 47 order (100 units) is expected P49-P51 (might arrive after game end).\nTotal effective in-transit = 330 units (excluding the P47 order, which may not arrive in time). This is more than sufficient to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 210-240 units total). \n5. **Decision**: The OR recommendation is 0, which aligns with the strategy of winding down inventory to avoid leftover stock.

Current on-hand inventory is 0, and demand has stabilized around 80 units per period (last 5-period average is 75.4, but excluding the P46 outlier, it's closer to 90).
