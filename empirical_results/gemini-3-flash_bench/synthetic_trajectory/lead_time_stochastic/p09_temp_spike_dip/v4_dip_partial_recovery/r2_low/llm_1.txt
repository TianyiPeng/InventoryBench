Using the provided historical samples (Periods 1-5), the average demand is approximately 91.6 units (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The system has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) should arrive at the start of Period 4 (Decision Phase) based on the observation delay (Ordered P1 -> Arrives P1+2=P3 Arrival Resolution -> Observed P4 Start). Therefore, the current order plus on-hand inventory must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand for 3 periods is ~275 units. I will order 300 units to establish a baseline inventory and provide a small safety buffer for initial demand volatility (since on-hand is currently 0).",

The average is approximately 106.

The promised lead time is 2. This suggests high variability in lead time (ranging 1-3 periods). \n\nInventory & Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 366. In-transit are orders from Period 2 (100 units) and Period 4 (130 units), totaling 230.

Lead times for successful deliveries currently fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P38, P39 arrived in 1 period; P34, P35, P36 arrived in 1-2 periods). However, there is a severe reliability issue: the 'In-transit' total of 990 is heavily inflated by lost orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 25, 29, 30, and 33. The likely valid pipeline consists only of orders from P37 (80 units - now overdue at L=6), P40 (90 units - L=3), P41 (80 units - L=2), and P42 (80 units - L=1). Considering P37 is now likely lost (6 periods late), the active reliable pipeline is 250 units (P40, P41, P42). Total inventory (On-hand: 0 + active pipeline: 250) must cover demand for the next L+1 periods (approx. 3-4 periods). With an expected demand of ~80/period, we need ~320 units.

The pipeline shows 980 units in-transit, but historical analysis indicates that orders from P15, P17, P18, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37 are almost certainly lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 320 units from orders placed in P41 (80), P42 (80), P43 (80), and the current period P44. Observed lead times are volatile (1 to 3 periods); focusing on a conservative lead time of 3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 44, 45, 46, and 47 (approx 300-320 units).

The P44 order (ordered P44, L=2/3) should have arrived by P46-P47 but is now potentially lost given it's P50 and it hasn't appeared. Lead times are currently averaging 3 periods (P40, 41, 42 arrived with L=3; P43 arrived with L=2). To cover the remaining periods and a 3-period lead time buffer, I need a target inventory of ~240 (80 units * 3 periods). The active pipeline excluding P44 is 350. However, being at P50 (the final period), the 'Order for Period 50' will arrive in the future and cannot satisfy demand within this specific game's horizon if the game ends at 50. If the game continues, I order 50 to maintain the flow, but if this is the absolute final decision for a 50-period horizon, the order is technically for future-period arrival which won't be seen.
