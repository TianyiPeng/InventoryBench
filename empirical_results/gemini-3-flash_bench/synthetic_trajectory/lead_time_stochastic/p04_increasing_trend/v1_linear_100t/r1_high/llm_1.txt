The average demand across these 5 periods is 315.4 units, but the trajectory suggests a growth regime rather than a stationary mean. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 3. To cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1), I need to account for the upward trend. Assuming demand continues to rise or stabilizes near the recent high, I'll estimate demand for P1-P3 as approximately 100/250/300. Starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to place a substantial opening order. I will target a total pipeline of roughly 900 units to cover the immediate 3-period window and provide a small buffer for the growth trend.",

Logistics remain volatile, but the pattern suggests a planning lead time (L) of 3 periods. To calculate the needed pipeline (on-hand + in-transit), I use (L+1) * expected demand. With L=3, the target is 4 periods of demand: 4 * 2,500 = 10,000 units. Currently, the in-transit inventory is 15,450 units, which significantly exceeds the base target. However, history (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) shows that large segments of the pipeline can be lost entirely. Orders from P17 (1,550), P18 (1,550), and P19 (1,650), totaling 4,750 units, are confirmed lost (7+ periods since ordering). Additionally, P24 (2,600) and P25 (2,800) have not yet arrived. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0) and frequent stockouts (P20-22 and P26) dictate an aggressive ordering strategy to buffer against the 'burst' arrival behavior and high loss risk.
