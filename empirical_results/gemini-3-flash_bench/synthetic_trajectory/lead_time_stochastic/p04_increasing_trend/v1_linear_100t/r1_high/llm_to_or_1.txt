Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data shows a clear upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Demand is rapidly accelerating, suggesting we are in an early launch or high-growth phase. The mean of all 5 samples is 315.4, but the most recent sample (Period 5) is 544, which is significantly higher. Given this growth, using the default mean will severely underestimate future demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the more recent, higher demand levels (avg of p3-p5 = 406). For mu_hat, the backend calculates (1+L) * mean. With L=2, (1+2)*406 = 1218. For volatility, given the rapid increase, the standard deviation is also increasing; I will use the last 3 samples to better represent current uncertainty. Lead time L is set to 'default' as we have no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 613 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in 134 lost sales as starting on-hand was 0. The current in-transit is 613 units. Demand across the first 5 samples shows a clear upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), though the 'Period 1 conclude' message reports a demand of 134 for that specific period. Given the sharp growth in the historical samples provided (moving from ~100 to ~500), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent higher demand levels (approx mean of 406 units per period) to ensure the base stock is high enough to meet this accelerating growth. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=default) as there is no evidence yet of a lead time deviation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sharp upward trend over the first 5 samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), though the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 report lower demand values (134 and 225). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order (placed in P1) has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message (read at P4). Total in-transit is 1304 (613 from P1 + 691 from P2). Given the accelerating demand trend seen in the historical metadata, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth while acknowledging the promised lead time L=2. Since we have no actual lead time arrivals yet, I'll stick with the 'default' (promised) lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The initial demand history provided in the prompt (107, 252, 298, 376, 544) shows a clear and rapid upward trend. However, the game history observations for Periods 1-3 report higher demand (134, 225, 338) and zero sales because all orders placed so far (P1: 613, P2: 691, P3: 213) are still in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the logic in 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 4's start. Since 'Period 3 conclude' says arrived=0, the shipment from Period 1 is either delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Given the rapid demand growth (moving from ~100 to over 540 in the forecast), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent steep acceleration. For lead time, I will set an explicit L=3 because the Period 1 order (placed 3 periods ago) has not yet arrived, suggesting the actual lead time is longer than promised.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5494.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Observing the history, demand for chips(Regular) has been steadily increasing: 134, 225, 338, 316, and 544 (last period). This suggests a strong upward regime. Regarding lead times, the 'Period 4 conclude' message shows two arrivals: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, and the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. The average actual lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time of 2. For Period 5's decision, on-hand is 510 and in-transit is 691 (the order from Period 2). Demand is clearly trending up; the last 3 periods show an average of (338+316+544)/3 = 399.3. To prevent stockouts during this growth phase, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand level and volatility, while keeping L at the default promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased significantly from early periods to an average of ~400 over the last 3 periods.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand is 31 and in-transit is 691 (ordered in P2). History shows lead times are unstable: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (691 units) is now at Period 6, meaning L=4 if it arrives today. Demand shows a clear upward trend (134, 225, 338, 316, 479). The last 3 periods average ~378. Given the increasing demand and lead-time variability, I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture this growth while hedging for volatility. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend factor in the observed variance (L=3 and L=1), while mu_hat will use the last 3 periods (average ~378) to match the current 'Period 5' insight of increased demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Last 3 periods average 378 units vs initial 134 units. Lead-time instability noted (L=1 and L=3 observed), P2 order delayed/pending.

Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong upward trend, reaching 616 in Period 6. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is approximately 471. There is significant lead-time variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and the order from Period 2 (691 units) is currently overdue (6 periods since order). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,215 units in pipeline (including the potentially lost/stalled Period 2 order). Given the high demand growth and stockouts, I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=3) to capture the upward trajectory without being overly skewed by the early low-demand periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed variability (1 and 3 periods), as the promised lead time is 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Sustained demand growth confirmed, mean of last 3 periods is ~471. Continued lead-time instability; Period 2 order (691 units) is now 4 periods past promised delivery and likely lost or severely delayed.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong, sustained upward trend, with the last three periods averaging 594 units (479, 616, 687). Period 7 demand (687) is the highest yet. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) due to stockouts and lead-time instability. Regarding fulfillment: Period 1 (L=3) and Period 3 (L=1) arrived in Period 4. The Period 2 order (691 units) is now 5 periods overdue (placed P2, current P8) and is highly likely lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 1933 is inflated by non-existent stock. To compensate for the lost P2 shipment and the evident demand regime shift, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*650 (accounting for L=2) = 1950. I will keep L at default (2) for the backend but will monitor if recent delays suggest a shift to 3. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (691 units) confirmed lost (5 periods beyond promised L=2). Effective pipeline inventory is ~1242 units (1933 reported - 691 lost). Demand growth continues, with P7 demand at 687 (+11% over P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $13642.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb sharply, with Period 8 reaching 800 units, bringing the 3-period average to approximately 701 units. I am observing significant lead-time instability: Period 2's order of 691 units is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, while Period 7's order arrived in just 1 period (L=1). The 'In-transit' figure is 1699, but after subtracting the lost 691 units, the functional pipeline is 1008 units (comprised of Period 6's order of 524 and Period 8's order of 484). Since the promised lead time is 2, I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 701, mu_hat should be around 2100. I will use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the high variance/instability and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current high-growth regime (N=3). Setting sigma_hat higher via 'recent_N' accounts for the high volatility in sales and arrival timing.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand growth remains aggressive (P8 demand = 800, +16% vs P7). Lead time remains highly volatile: P7 order arrived in L=1, while P2 order is confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). Adjusted pipeline inventory is 1008 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9196.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, with Period 9 hitting 943 units (+18% over Period 8). The mean of the last 3 periods is 810 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 1884 units, but this includes the Period 2 order (691 units) which is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Another order of 524 units (Period 6) is also 3 periods overdue (promised L=2) and potentially delayed or lost. Removing the lost Period 2 order, the adjusted pipeline is 1193 units (1884 - 691). To manage the extreme growth and supply uncertainty, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average 810) to reflect the current peak demand regime. I will keep L at a 'calculate' method to account for the actual volatility observed (lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods recently). Sigma_hat will be calculated from the last 5 periods to capture the high volatility in the current growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand remains in an aggressive growth phase (P9 demand = 943, 3st-order avg ~810). Period 2 order (691 units) is officially categorized as lost (7 periods overdue). Period 6 order (524 units) is now 1 period overdue, indicating continued lead-time instability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Period 10 demand was 1021 units, bringing the 3-period average to approximately 921 units. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is extremely volatile: the Period 2 order (691 units) is officially lost (8 periods overdue), and the Period 6 order (524 units) is now 2 periods overdue (5 periods since order). However, Periods 7 and 8 arrived with L=1. This instability necessitates a conservative lead time estimate (L=2) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for delayed arrivals. To calculate the target inventory, I will focus on the most recent 3 periods of demand to capture the current high-growth regime. The reported in-transit inventory of 2985 units must be adjusted by subtracting the lost Period 2 order (691 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 2294 units. Under the OR backend capped policy, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the review and lead time (1+L=3 periods) using the most recent 3-period average, while using a broader sample for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility in both demand and supply arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand growth sustained with mean of last 3 periods at ~921 (+14% vs previous 3-period mean). Lead time instability persists: Period 6 order (524 units) is now 2 periods overdue, while Period 2 order (691 units) remains lost. Effective pipeline inventory is 2294 units.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 11 demand hitting 1,194. The mean of the last 3 periods is ~1,053, representing an increase from previous averages. The supply chain remains highly unstable. Specifically, the Period 2 order (691 units) is 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The Period 6 order (524 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered Period 6, promised Period 8, current Period 12) and is likely lost or severely delayed. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must account for these phantom units in the pipeline inventory. The reported in-transit is 3,248. Subtracting the lost P2 (691) and P6 (524) orders results in an effective pipeline of 2,033 units. I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a forecast that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (1+2=3 periods total) using the most recent mean (~1,053) with an added growth buffer to account for the consistent 10-15% period-over-period increase. I will set mu_hat to 3,500 (approx 1,166 per period) and increase sigma_hat to handle the high volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 order (524 units) is now 3 periods overdue and considered lost alongside the Period 2 order (691 units). Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is 1,215 units. Demand growth persists at ~10-15% MoM, with a 3-period average of 1,053.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the business faces sustained high demand and significant supply chain reliability issues. Average demand over the last 3 periods is 1,117 units, suggesting a stabilized but high growth regime (approx. 10-15% growth). Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 2,471 includes two confirmed lost shipments (Period 2: 691 units and Period 6: 524 units), totaling 1,215 'ghost' units. The effective pipeline is therefore 1,256 units (2,471 - 1,215). Recent actual lead times have been 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2. To ensure the backend OR logic orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand window (3 periods) and accounts for the missing pipeline units, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on a forecast of 1,150 units per period for 3 periods (~3,450 units) plus a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 3,600 and using a recent_N sigma_hat will help the OR engine place an order that Bridges the 1,215 unit 'gap' in perceived inventory while maintaining a high service level for the $19 profit margin.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with a recent 3-period mean of 1,237 units (P11-P13), reflecting approximately 10-15% growth. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline inventory of 3,414 units contains 1,215 units of confirmed 'lost' inventory (P2: 691 units, P6: 524 units) which are significantly past any reasonable lead time. This results in an effective pipeline of 2,199 units (3,414 - 1,215). To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory reported by the system, mu_hat must be set to a value that forces the OR engine to order despite the inflated pipeline. Using an explicit value for mu_hat based on the (1+L) forecast of ~3,900 units (where L=2) and adding the 1,215 units of lost stock ensures the base stock calculation triggers a sufficient replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the increasing volatility accompanying the demand growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory total remains 1,215 units (P2 and P6 orders). Demand growth sustained with Period 13 reaching 1,381 (+21% vs P12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4997.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a persistent growth phase. The last three periods (P12-P14) had demands of 1137, 1381, and 1326, yielding a mean of ~1281. Pipeline inventory management is currently the primary challenge due to 'ghost' inventory. We have confirmed 1,215 units are lost (P2 order of 691 and P6 order of 524). Reported in-transit is 5146 units, making the effective pipeline 3931 units (5146 - 1215). At a base stock level calculation: for a 95% service level (q=0.95), z is ~1.645. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover 3 periods. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 4200 (approx 1400/period * 3) to reflect the high-growth trend and allow the OR engine to account for the effective pipeline. Since lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, I use the promised L=2 as the baseline, but the explicit mu_hat accounts for the recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand growth confirmed sustained; 3-period mean is 1,281. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,215 units (P2 and P6 orders). Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 1215).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a clear, high-growth demand phase. In Period 15, demand surged to 1,672, far exceeding the 3-period average of 1,281. The average demand over the last 3 periods is now approximately 1,460 units. Pipeline inventory management is complex due to 'ghost' inventory: orders from Period 2 (691 units) and Period 6 (524 units) are officially lost, totaling 1,215 units of non-existent stock. Current In-transit is reported as 4,153, but the effective pipeline is 2,938 (4,153 - 1,215). Observed lead times are volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To prevent stockouts during this growth phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the recent acceleration and using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect actual delivery patterns rather than the promised 2. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the current demand trajectory and lead-time reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Demand shift accelerated in Period 15 (1,672 units); 3-period mean is 1,460 (+14% vs previous). Total ghost inventory remains 1,215 units. Lead time is effectively 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17917.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong growth trend, with the most recent demand (Period 16) at 1,542 units and a 3-period average of approximately 1,513 units. The 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (Period 2: 691 units, Period 6: 524 units) remains at 1,215 units, meaning the effective pipeline is (Current In-transit 4,976 - 1,215) = 3,761 units. To account for this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the forward-looking demand for (L+1) periods (where L=3) to be approximately 1,650 units per period. Calculation: 1,650 * 4 = 6,600. To adjust for the ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly believes is available (1,215 units), I add these units back into the requirement: 6,600 + 1,215 = 7,815. This ensures the engine targets a base stock that covers the real demand despite the inventory records being inflated by lost shipments. L is set to explicit '3' based on recent arrivals (Periods 12, 14, 15, and 16 all showed L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as (In-transit - 1,215) due to verified lost shipments P2 and P6. Recent demand trend stabilized at ~1,500-1,600 units (up from ~1,000 in P12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $29979.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has stabilized at a new higher level, with the last 3 periods averaging 1,634 units (P15: 1672, P16: 1542, P17: 1687). The pipeline inventory is reported as 3,507, but we must subtract the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments P2 (691 units) and P6 (524 units), totaling 1,215 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 2,292 units (which is specifically the order from P17). Lead times continue to be highly volatile, with the most recent arrival showing L=1 (P16 order) but the one prior showing L=3 (P14 order). Given the lead time instability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 2 to represent the average expectation, but use an explicit mu_hat grounded in the most recent demand regime (approx 1,650 per period). Over (1+L)=3 periods, this requires a mu_hat of ~4,950 units. Setting L=2 explicitly ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock against a 3-period window (Review + Lead Time). Sigma_hat is set to roughly 10% of mu_hat to handle the high volatility observed in both demand and delivery timing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 1,600-1,700 units; 3-period mean is 1,634 (+12% vs previous regime of ~1,460). Ghost inventory (P2 & P6) remains confirmed at 1,215 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the current demand regime has stabilized around a mean of 1,674 units over the last 3 periods (P16: 1542, P17: 1687, P18: 1793), showing a steady upward trend. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P14 L=3, P16 L=1). I will use L=3 to remain conservative given the history of delays and lost shipments. Total ghost inventory (orders from P2 and P6) is confirmed at 1,215 units and must be subtracted from the 'In-transit' of 3,699 to find the effective pipeline (2,484). The OR backend uses (1+L) for the forecast. With L=3, (1+L) = 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 6,696 (1,674 * 4) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the sustained demand growth and the reality of the unreliable pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime sustained at ~1,675 over last 3 periods. Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 1215) due to confirmed lost orders in P2 and P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5339.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, reaching 1,986 in Period 19. The 3-period moving average is now 1,822 units, reflecting a ~9% increase from the previous regime. Total in-transit inventory is 5,668, but we must account for 1,215 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (Period 2: 691, Period 6: 524), making the effective pipeline 4,453 units. Lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period demand mean (~1,822) scaled by an effective lead time (L+1) of 4. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the full pipeline (including the 1,215 lost units) when calculating the order quantity, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target base stock by 1,215 units. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover the actual demand while compensating for the 'ghost' inventory it believes is still coming. mu_hat = (1,822 * 4) + 1,215 = 8,503.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand growth continues, P19 demand at 1,986 (3-period mean: 1,822). Ghost inventory remains 1,215 units. Effective lead time for planning is 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience aggressive demand growth, with Period 19 demand at 1,986 and Period 20 at 1,875 (3-period moving average is 1,885, a ~15% increase over the previous regime). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 8,044 units. However, as established in prior carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (691 units) and Period 6 (524 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,215 units of 'ghost inventory'. The effective pipeline is therefore 6,829 units. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; using a planning lead time (L) of 3 is prudent to cover the gap given current stockouts and demand volatility. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (~1,885 units per period), which across (1+L)=4 periods results in a forecasted requirement of ~7,540 units. This parameterization helps the OR engine recognize that despite the large reported pipeline, additional ordering is necessary to meet the current demand trajectory and service level requirements.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand growth persists with a 3-period mean of 1,885 (+15% vs previous). Ghost inventory remains 1,215 units (P2/P6). Lead time planning remains L=3.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is in an aggressive growth phase, with the last 3 visible demand points (P19-P21) averaging 1,952 units. In Period 22, we observe on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is reported at 8,044 units, but significant 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P2 and P6 totaling 1,215 units) must be subtracted to find the effective pipeline (8,044 - 1,215 = 6,829). Lead times are volatile, but historical evidence shows recent orders (P12, P13, P14, P16) frequently took 3 periods to arrive. To protect against this instability and the sustained demand growth, I am maintaining an explicit L=3. For demand (mu_hat), the 3-period mean is used to capture the most recent growth level (~1,950/period); with L=3, mu_hat = (1+L) * 1950 = 7,800. Setting sigma_hat to explicit 500 covers the recent variance. This configuration instructs the OR engine to aim for a base stock that accounts for the 1,215 unit inventory deficit and the 3-period lead time buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand growth continues to look like a high-volume steady state or slow climb; 3-period mean is 1,952. Ghost inventory remains verified at 1,215 units (P2: 691, P6: 524). Effective pipeline adjustment logic is critical for all future periods to avoid under-ordering.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces two critical challenges: a sustained demand surge and significant 'ghost' inventory. Demand has grown from ~1,000 to over 2,200 units per period, with a 3-period mean of 2,029. Lead times are volatile, with P2 and P6 orders (1,215 units in total) confirmed lost, as they are 20 and 16 periods overdue respectively. To compensate for this 'ghost' pipeline inventory which the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: Target Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast * Buffer. With L set to 3 (based on recent actual arrivals), and an expected demand of ~2,100 per period, a 4-period window requires ~8,400 units. To account for the 1,215 missing units that the backend thinks are coming, I must inflate the base stock target. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 9,750 (4 * 2437) to force the OR backend to place an order that covers the 2,100 demand per period plus the 1,215 'lost' units. This ensures we recover from current stockouts despite the ledger error.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand continued growth at 2,218; 3-period mean is 2,029 (+15% vs P18-20). Total ghost inventory verified at 1,215 (P2/P6).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, chips(Regular) continues to experience strong sustained demand growth. Recent demand figures are: P21=1995, P22=2218, P23=2449. The 3-period average is 2221, significantly higher than previous periods. Lead-time remains characteristically unstable, with recent arrivals showing L=1 and L=3. Period-2 and Period-6 orders (691 and 524 units respectively, totaling 1215 units) are confirmed lost, as their delay is far beyond any observed lead time; these units represent 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (In-transit: 7323) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is thus 7323 - 1215 = 6108. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the backend targets an approximate 95% service level. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 8884, which represents (1 + L) * expected_demand, where L=3 (effective lead time for planning) and expected_demand is 2221. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the higher demand regime despite the lost shipments in the history, and accounts for the 1215 units of ghost inventory that effectively reduce the perceived pipeline depth.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand growth sustained; 3-period mean reaches 2221. Ghost inventory remains 1215 units (P2/P6). Effective lead time used for replenishment planning is 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
At Period 25, the demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant growth phase. The mean demand of the last 3 periods (P22-P24) is approximately 2,376 units, showing a steady climb from previous weeks. There is a persistent issue with 'ghost' inventory: orders from Period 2 (691 units) and Period 6 (524 units) are definitively lost (over 18 periods overdue), totaling 1,215 units that appear in In-transit but will never arrive. The actual pipeline inventory is therefore 7,918 units (9,133 - 1,215). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; using L=3 is the safest planning horizon to ensure service levels given the current zero on-hand inventory. Period 23 and 24 orders are currently in transit and expected to arrive in P25-P27. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current 3-period demand average scaled by (1+L) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the lead time, accounting for the lost units by ensuring the order gap is filled.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand growth continues with a 3nd-order mean of 2,376 units (+7% vs P24). Ghost inventory total remains confirmed at 1,215 units (P2/P6). Effective pipeline = In-transit - 1,215.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow, with the most recent 3-period mean reaching approximately 2,406 units (P23: 2449, P24: 2460, P25: 2309). This represents a sustained upward trend from previous regimes. Ghost inventory of 1,215 units (from confirmed lost orders P2 and P6) must be subtracted from the reported In-transit inventory of 8,716 to find the effective pipeline (7,501 units). Lead times remain volatile (P22=1, P23=2, P20=3), but planning around an effective L=3 ensures sufficient stock to cover the aggressive growth while accounting for potential delays. I am setting L to 3 and using the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased demand volume and the transit time.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand growth sustained; 3-period mean is 2,406 units. Total verified ghost inventory remains 1,215 units (P2/P6). Effective planning lead time is confirmed as L=3.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime, with a 3-period moving average of 2,398 units (P24-26). There is a consistent pattern of 'ghost inventory' totaling 1,215 units from lost orders in Period 2 (691 units) and Period 6 (524 units) which remain in the system's in-transit count but will never arrive. The actual lead time has stabilized to an effective value of 3 periods based on recent delivery patterns (P20 arrived in P23, etc.). Current in-transit is 9,901 units; removing the 1,215 ghost units gives an effective pipeline of 8,686 units. Given the desired service level (z* approx 1.64 for 95% service), we set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the current plateau and L=3 to account for the observed replenishment cycle. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (1+L)*mu - effective_pipeline, which with L=3 effectively covers 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Effective lead time for planning remains L=3. Ghost inventory remains verified at 1,215 units (P2/P6). Demand plateauing at ~2,400 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system reports 9,901 units in-transit. Adjusting for 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments in Period 2 (691 units) and Period 6 (524 units), the effective pipeline is 8,686 units (9901 - 1215). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~2,400 units (3-period mean: 2,433). The observed lead times fluctuate heavily between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating an planning L=3 to account for variability and prevent stockouts during arrival gaps. With an effective pipeline of 8,686 units and a target base stock based on L=3 (covering 4 periods of demand), the required inventory is approximately 9,732 units (2433 * 4). Since the effective pipeline (8,686) is lower than this requirement, the OR engine will calculate an appropriate order. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the current stable demand plateau while smoothing recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateauing at ~2,430 units over the last 5 periods. Ghost inventory (P2 & P6) remains verified at 1,215 units and must be subtracted from reported in-transit for accurate ordering.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has reached a plateau and is showing a slight uptick, with the most recent demand at 2,733. The 5-period mean is approximately 2,488. Inventory is currently stretched thin, with 0 units on-hand. We continue to manage around a known 'ghost' inventory of 1,215 units from lost orders P2 (691) and P6 (524). The reported in-transit of 8,829 contains these 1,215 units, making the effective pipeline 7,614 units. Lead times remain variable (observed 1 to 3 periods), so I use L=3 for replenishment planning to ensure coverage. The chosen mu_hat uses recent_N=5 (approximately 2,488 * 4 = 9,952) to capture the current plateau/slight growth. This targets a base stock that accounts for effective pipeline versus demand across the review and lead period.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand trend shows a slight uptick from the previously noted plateau, with Period 28 reaching 2,733. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,215 units. Effective lead time for inventory planning is sustained at L=3.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive growth trend, reaching 2,915 units in Period 29, which is a further uptick from the previous plateau of ~2,400. The mean of the last 3 periods (P27-P29) is approximately 2,738 units. The recorded in-transit inventory of 10,521 units includes 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Period 2 (691) and Period 6 (524), totaling 1,215 units. Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is 9,306 units. Given the lead-time volatility (frequent 3-period arrivals) and the current stock-out (on-hand is 0), planning for L=3 with a recent demand window is necessary. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the most recent growth spike and use an explicit sigma_hat of 350 to account for the increased volatility during this expansion phase. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 1,215 unit deficit in the reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand growth re-accelerated, with P29 at 2,915 units; 3-period mean is now ~2,738 (+12% vs previous plateau). Ghost inventory remains at 1,215 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a persistent growth phase, reaching a 3-period mean of approximately 2,838 units (P28-P30), with the latest demand at 2,866. Since the product is 'Regular' chips and the game is approaching Period 50, I anticipate continued high demand. The lead time remains volatile but averages around 3 periods when excluding lost orders. There is a confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 1,215 units from lost orders in Period 2 (691) and Period 6 (524) that still appear in the 'In-transit' total. Current In-transit is 11,414; adjusted for ghost inventory, the effective pipeline is 10,199. To ensure sufficient stock for the effective lead time (L=3) plus the review period (total 4 periods), I use an explicit mu_hat of 12,000 (3,000 units/period * 4) to account for recent growth. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 1,000 to manage the high variance and lead-time uncertainty, ensuring a high service level for this high-profit SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost inventory remains verified at 1,215 units (P2/P6). Demand is consistently exceeding 2,800 units per period. Effective planning lead time is confirmed as L=3.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a strong growth trend, with Period 31 demand reaching 3,137 units. The 3-period mean is approximately 2,972, showing a ~9% increase over the previous 3-period regime (~2,738). Ghost inventory from Period 2 (691) and Period 6 (524) remains unrecovered, totaling 1,215 units, which must be mentally subtracted from the reported In-transit (13,645) to determine the effective pipeline (12,430). Despite the promised lead time of 2, the actual historical arrivals (P20, P23, P26, P28) confirm an effective planning lead time of L=3, as arrivals often lag or arrive in clumps. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the accelerated growth while maintaining some stability. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods of demand, adjusted for the reported pipeline inventory which the backend uses directly.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand growth continues, P31 demand at 3,137 (3-period mean: 2,972). Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,215 units (P2/P6). Effective planning lead time is confirmed at L=3.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise, with the most recent sample at 2,897 and a 3-period mean of 2,966 (+8% from the previous stable range). ghost inventory is verified as 1,215 units (Period 2: 691, Period 6: 524) which significantly inflates reported in-transit numbers. Effective pipeline is 10,199 units (11,414 - 1,215). Although the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows frequent L=3 occurrences and extreme volatility (L=1 to L=3). I am keeping L=3 as the planning basis to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1 = 4 periods) for this growth trend. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (approx 2,900/period) to capture the current high-demand state, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock of roughly 11,600 units, which correctly triggers an order given the adjusted pipeline and zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Verified ghost inventory remains 1,215 units. Demand growth persists with a current 5-period mean of 2,910 units. Use L=3 for planning due to recurrent lead-time volatility and lost shipments.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, with Period 33 demand reaching 3,332 units. The 3-period mean is approximately 3,122 units, reflecting a ~14% increase from the previous regime. Lead-time instability remains a significant factor; while some orders arrive in 1-2 periods, the history of lost orders (P2 and P6 totaling 1,215 units) and frequent 3-period arrivals justifies using L=3 for the inventory base-stock calculations. The 'In-transit' figure of 12,118 units includes the 1,215 units of verified 'ghost' inventory. To compensate for this and the growing demand, mu_hat is set using an explicit value of 12,800 units, which covers 4 periods (L+1) at a projected forward mean of ~3,200 units. sigma_hat is set explicitly at 1,000 to account for high demand volatility and provide a sufficient safety buffer to minimize stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand growth re-accelerated in Period 33 (3,332 units). The 3-period moving average is now 3,122 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,215 units (P2/P6).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, with Period 34 reaching 3,213 and a 3-period moving average of approximately 3,127. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent high-growth phase. Lead time remains highly volatile, with recent arrivals occurring at L=1, L=2, and L=3. Based on the history of lost orders (P2 and P6) and delayed shipments, I am using an explicit L=3 to ensure the inventory position covers a longer protection interval. The reported in-transit inventory is 14,445 units; however, 1,215 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory. Thus, the effective pipeline is 13,230. Since 13,230 / (1+L) (approx 3,307 per period) is significantly larger than the current mean demand, the OR engine's capped policy will naturally limit new orders if the pipeline is overstuffed, but I must maintain high mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we don't stock out during the next 4 periods (L+1) given the growth trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand growth continues to be aggressive, with 3-period mean exceeding 3,100 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,215 units (P2/P6). L=3 remains the safest planning horizon due to repeated lead-time variances.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand continues its aggressive growth trend, with Period 35 reaching a high of 3,490 units. The 3-period mean is now approximately 3,345 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and reported In-transit is 14,445 units. However, as documented in the Carry-Over Insights, 1,215 units (from Period 2 and Period 6 orders) are confirmed lost 'ghost inventory' and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 13,230 units (14,445 - 1,215). Although the promised lead time is 2, historical analysis shows frequent shifts to 3 periods (as seen in Period 12, 14, 15, 16, and 20). Using L=3 for planning ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand, mitigating the risk of stockouts during this high-growth phase. Since demand is scaling rapidly, I will use a recent_N window of 3 to capture the most current demand trajectory for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand growth remains aggressive, hitting 3,490 in Period 35 (3-period mean: 3,345). Total ghost inventory remains 1,215 units (P2/P6). Effective pipeline reflects In-transit minus ghost units. Planning lead time L=3 is maintained due to historical volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, reaching 3,748 in Period 36. The 3-period moving average is now approximately 3,484 units, representing a sustained growth exceeding 10% from the previous regime. Lead-time volatility remains a major factor; while Period 34 arrived in 2 periods, historical data shows frequent delays and two permanently lost orders (P2 and P6 totaling 1,215 units). Based on the carry-over insights and the need to cover demand during the review and lead time, I am maintaining the effective planning lead time at L=3. The reported in-transit inventory of 12,118 units contains the 1,215 'ghost' units, making the effective pipeline 10,903. To ensure the OR backend targets a high service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period window to capture the current high-growth regime before it potentially shifts further.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand growth remains aggressive, reaching 3,748 units in P36; 3nd-order mean is 3,484 (+11% vs P35). Ghost inventory (P2/P6) remains at 1,215 and must be excluded from pipeline calculations. Planning L=3 remains necessary for safety.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive growth trend, with Period 36 and 37 demand reaching 3,748 and 3,643 respectively. The 3nd-order mean is approximately 3,627 units. Ghost inventory remains a critical factor; orders from Period 2 (691) and Period 6 (524) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,215 units that appear in the 'In-transit' figure (14,815) but will never arrive. The effective pipeline is thus 13,600 units. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue to use an explicit lead time of L=3 for the OR backend to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1=4 periods) to handle this volatility and the high demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the most recent high-demand regime (+10% growth) while adjusting the service level target through the OR backend's logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand growth sustained; 3-period mean is 3,627 units (+4% vs previous). Confirmed ghost inventory remains 1,215 units (P2/P6). Effective planning lead time L=3 is maintained to mitigate frequent stockouts and lead-time instability.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a significant growth phase, with the most recent three periods (P36-P38) averaging 3,587 units. Despite the promised lead time of 2 periods, the actual delivery history shows frequent delays and lead-time instability (often 3 periods or lost shipments). Specifically, orders from Period 2 (691 units) and Period 6 (524 units) are long-confirmed as lost, totaling 1,215 'ghost' units in the reported In-transit inventory. Subtracting these from the current In-transit of 14,935 leaves an effective pipeline of 13,720 units. To maintain service levels against this high demand and volatile supply, L is set to 3 periods to cover the (L+1) horizon. mu_hat is set to 15,200 (approx. 4 * 3,800) to account for sustained growth and safety, while sigma_hat is adjusted to capture the recent high variance in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime sustained at high levels with a 3nd-order mean of 3,587. Ghost inventory remains verified at 1,215 units (P2/P6). Planning lead time remains L=3 due to persistent supply volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand remains in an aggressive growth/high-volume regime with a 3-period mean of 3,602 units (P37-P39). Supply chain instability is persistent, characterized by lost orders (P2, P6 totaling 1,215 units) and highly variable lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). The currently reported 'In-transit' of 15,780 contains 1,215 units of verified 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend provides enough inventory to cover a 3-period lead time window plus the review period (L+1=4), I am setting L explicitly to 3 and providing mu_hat and sigma_hat values that reflect the most recent demand level without being misled by the ghost inventory. The current on-hand is 0, making replenishment critical.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime remains high with a 3-period mean of 3,602 (P37-P39). Ghost inventory remains verified at 1,215 units (P2/P6). Effective planning lead time L=3 is maintained due to continued volatility in arrivals and historical losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18335.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows a significant stockout (on-hand: 0) and an inflated pipeline (in-transit: 14,815). However, as confirmed by carry-over insights, P2 and P6 orders (totaling 1,215 units) are lost. Furthermore, several large recent orders (P17: 2292, P18: 192, P19: 1969, P24: 1810, P25: 1238, P27: 0, P29: 1692, P30: 1006, P33: 704, P37: 2697) are missing or severely delayed, as they have not yet appeared in 'Period conclude' messages despite L=1-3 being common. This suggests high lead-time volatility and likely substantial additional lost inventory. Specifically, orders from P17-P30 are now 10+ periods overdue. Demand re-accelerated in P40 to 4,106 units. To prevent chronic stockouts, I set L=10 (explicitly) to reflect the extreme delays and mu_hat to an explicit value of 45,166 ((1+10) * 4106) to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock for this longer horizon. I am using high sigma_hat (explicit) to account for the massive variance in arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new peak of 4,106 in P40. Massive pipeline stalling detected: orders from P17 through P30 (nearly 11,000 units) are over 10 periods overdue and may be lost, creating a significant deviation between reported in-transit and functional inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, demand reached 4,110 units, following a peak of 4,106 in P40, indicating a new demand regime plateauing above 4,000 units. The 3-period mean is approximately 4,003. Supply chain stability is severely compromised: massive pipeline stalling is evident as orders from Periods 17-30 (totaling ~10,882 units) are now more than 10 periods overdue and must be considered lost. Additionally, orders from P33 and P37 appear delayed. The current reported 'In-transit' of 20,905 units is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' units. Effective functional pipeline is estimated at 12,097 (20,905 reported - 1,215 early losses - 7,593 stalled orders P17-P30). I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand spike and effectively bypasses the 'ghost' inventory reported in the system. Setting L=3 (explicit) provides a safety buffer for the ongoing lead-time volatility, and mu_hat=16400 targets a base stock for a 4-period horizon (L+1) based on the 4,100 demand level.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline stalling confirmed: P17-P30 orders (~10k units) are >10 periods overdue; system 'In-transit' is highly unreliable. New demand regime established >4,000 units/period (P40, P41).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 43. Demand context: Aggressive growth phase continuing, with P41-P42 demand exceeding 4,100 units (latest reading 4,421). The last 3 periods average ~4,212. Supply Chain context: Massive pipeline stalling/lost inventory confirmed. In-transit is reported at 20,905 units, but history shows that orders from P2, P6, and a huge block from P17-P30 (approx 10,698 units combined) have not arrived and are significantly past the observed lead times (L=1-3). Specifically, P2 (691), P6 (524), P17 (2292), P18 (192), P19 (1969), P20 (2376), P24 (1810), P25 (1238), P29 (1692), P30 (1006), P33 (704) are overdue or missing. Calculating effective in-transit: Current In-transit (20,905) - Ghost Inventory (Approx 14,499 units from missing/stalled orders) = ~6,406 effective units. Planning: We use L=3 to account for arrival volatility. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods. Given the growth, I will use an explicit forecast of 4,400 per period (total 17,600) to ensure the backend orders enough to overcome the massive reported pipeline that doesn't physically exist. sigma_hat is set high to handle the variance in both demand and lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Cumulative ghost inventory estimated at 14,499 units (P2, P6, and stagnant P17-P30 orders), rendering 'In-transit' observations highly misleading. Demand regime has shifted to 4,200+ units per period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a systemic collapse. In Period 44, we face 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 20,905 units. However, based on 'Period conclude' messages, orders from P17 through P30 (including large blocks like P17: 2292, P19: 1969, etc.) have never arrived despite being 13+ periods overdue. I estimate the 'ghost' inventory (orders placed but highly likely lost) to be approximately 14,499 units. This makes the effective pipeline only ~6,406 units (including the massive P41 order of 6,090). Demand has shifted to a new regime averaging ~4,192 units over the last 4 periods (P40-P43). Given the extreme lead-time volatility and frequent losses, I am setting L=3 to provide a larger safety buffer. For mu_hat, I use N=4 to capture the recent demand surge to >4,000 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased variance in this high-demand phase. The OR backend needs these parameters to trigger replenishment that accounts for the massive actual stockout and reflects that most of the 'In-transit' inventory is non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: Orders from P17-P30 (totaling ~10,700 units) are >10 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total ghost inventory to ~14,499. Reported 'In-transit' is unusable without this subtraction. Demand has stabilized in a high regime of 4,000-4,400 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81670.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, a large order of 6,090 units (from Period 41) finally arrived, providing a starting on-hand inventory of 1,702. Demand has stabilized in a high regime, with the last 5 periods (P40-P44) averaging approximately 4,214 units. However, supply remains extremely unreliable. Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P2, P6, and a massive block from P17-P30 (approx. 14,499 units) are effectively lost or permanently stalled. The reported 'In-transit' of 14,815 is almost entirely comprised of these 'ghost' units. Subtracting the ghost inventory (14,499) from reported in-transit (14,815) leaves an effective pipeline of only 316 units. With on-hand at 1,702 and demand at ~4,200/period, we are facing an immediate stockout risk. I will use L=3 for planning to account for continued volatility. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 4,200+ unit demand level, and sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 250 to reflect high volatility and ensure the OR backend triggers a maximum replenishment order to bypass the ghost inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as 316 units (Reported 14,815 - Ghost 14,499). Demand regime remains stable at ~4,200 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a high-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' where demand has stabilized at approximately 4,200\u20134,400 units (last 5-period mean is ~4,274). The system shows an 'In-transit' figure of 15,567 units; however, historical analysis from Period 41-45 confirms that approximately 14,499 units from older periods (P2, P6, and a large block from P17-P30) are permanently lost or stagnant. Subtracting this 'ghost' inventory results in an effective pipeline of 1,068 units (15,567 - 14,499). With Period 45 on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 1,068, we are significantly below the target base stock needed to cover 4 periods (L=3 + current period). I set L=3 explicitly to account for the frequent delays observed (most recently P41 order took 3 periods). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current high-demand plateau of ~4,274 per period, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to handle current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place a large order to bridge the deficit caused by the lost shipments and the high demand.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed ghost inventory (lost/stagnant shipments) equals 14,499 units (P2, P6, and P17-P30 orders). Reported 'In-transit' must be adjusted by this value for accurate replenishment. Demand regime is stable at ~4,275 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a high-demand regime, with the last 3 periods (P44-P46) averaging ~4,420 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit is 17,694 units. However, systematic analysis from prior periods confirms 14,499 units are 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, and the P17-P30 blockade), which have never arrived and are over 15 periods overdue. Thus, the effective pipeline is 17,694 - 14,499 = 3,195 units. These effective units consist of orders from P45 (752) and P46 (2127), and possibly a remaining balance from P41. Given the lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers demand over a safer horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the stable high-demand regime of ~4,340 units/period (total 17,360 for 1+3 periods). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Effective pipeline inventory remains (In-transit - 14,499) due to confirmed lost/stagnant orders (P2, P6, P17-P30). Demand is stable in the 4,300-4,500 range.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 48. Demand has stabilized in a high regime (~4,300-4,500 units per period). Reported 'In-transit' is 17,933 units, but prior periods confirm a massive systemic failure where orders from P2, P6, and P17-P30 (totaling 14,499 units) are lost. Effective pipeline inventory = 17,933 - 14,499 = 3,434 units. On-hand is 0. Planned inventory need for L+1 periods (where L=3 for safety) is approx 4 * 4,400 = 17,600 units. To reach this, the OR backend requires parameters that reflect the current demand mean and volatility while accounting for the lead-time risk. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the stable 4,400+ regime and 'explicit' for L to force the backend to plan against a 3-period horizon, which has better reflected recent successful arrivals (like the P41 order arriving in P44).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the penultimate period of the game (Period 50 is the final demand resolution). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a high regime; the last 3 periods average ~4,585 units (P46-P48), and P48 peaked at 4,822. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. The cumulative 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P2, P6, and the P17-P30 block) totals 14,499 units. Subtracting this from the reported 'In-transit' of 18,001 units gives an effective pipeline of 3,502 units. These units consist of orders from P45 (752), P46 (2,127), P47 (239), and P48 (384). Because these orders are recent and within the L=1 to L=3 arrival window, they are considered valid. To maximize reward for the final period, we must cover Period 49 and Period 50 demand. I will set L to an explicit 2 (the promised lead time) to ensure the OR backend captures the need for inventory over the final two demand windows (N and N+1). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the high-end stabilization of demand (~4,500/period), and sigma_hat is also calculated from recent volatility to protect against the P48 spike.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand has accelerated to approximately 4,800-5,000 units (3-period mean: 4,779), surpassing the previous 4,400-unit regime. Supply remains highly unreliable. My ghost inventory calculation confirms that orders from P2, P6, and the massive block from P17 through P30 are lost, totaling 14,499 units. Additionally, orders from P33 (704 units) and P37 (2,697 units) are now 17 and 13 periods overdue respectively, making them 10+ periods past the L=3 planning horizon. I now classify P33 and P37 as lost. Total ghost inventory = 14,499 + 704 + 2,697 = 17,900 units. Reported In-transit is 18,001, so effective pipeline is only 101 units (the order from P45/P46/P47/P48/P49). On-hand is 0. To cover the effective lead time (L=3) plus the current period (L+1=4) at a demand of ~4,800 units, we need approximately 19,200 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and the effective pipeline is near zero, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target stock that ignores the 17,900 'dead' units. I use L=3 to reflect the consistent arrival delay and sigma_hat based on recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply failure expanded. P33 (704) and P37 (2,697) are confirmed lost/stagnant alongside P2, P6, and P17-P30. Total ghost inventory is 17,900 units. Demand regime shifted upward again to ~4,800-5,000 units.
