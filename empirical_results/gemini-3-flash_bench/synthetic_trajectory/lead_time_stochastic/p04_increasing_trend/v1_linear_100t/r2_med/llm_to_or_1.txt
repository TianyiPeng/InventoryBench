Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a clear and significant upward trend (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). Demand is effectively growing at an accelerating rate. Using a simple average of all samples would severely underestimate the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (avg \u2248 406). Given L=2, the backend will scale this by (1+L)=3 to estimate demand over the review and lead time. For volatility, I'll use recent_N as well to adapt to the higher variance seen in recent periods. The lead time L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 613 units with a promised lead time of 2. Based on the rules, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 146 units in Period 1. Historical demand for Period 1 was 107 (pre-game) vs 146 (actual), showing an upward trend. Overall demand history shows a strong growth pattern: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544 (pre-game samples) and 146 in Period 1. The pre-game samples suggest a much higher mean than the first period action. However, looking at the full sequence provided in 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), there is a clear and rapid increasing trend. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this momentum, as the demand is accelerating. L remains at the promised 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong upward trend (P1: 146, P2: 166, with historical context suggesting 107, 252, 298, 376, 544). The current on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (613 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision phase) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, we have 1297 units in transit (P1: 613 + P2: 684). Since demand is clearly in a growth phase, using a recent window (N=3) captures the upward trajectory better than the global mean. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as we haven't seen the first arrival yet to confirm any deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand for the first 3 periods was 146, 166, and 368. Demand is showing a sharp upward trend (from ~150 to ~370). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (613 units) was expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2), and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost sales for 3 consecutive periods, we need to account for a longer lead time (L=3) and the increasing demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent spike in demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and set lead time 'L' to 3 explicitly. The backend will calculate base stock using L=3, which covers the current period plus the 3-period lead time (total 4 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) exceeds promised 2 periods; P1 order (due P3) has not arrived as of P3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1517.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular): Demand has shown a significant upward trend (Period 1: 146, Period 2: 166, Period 3: 368, Period 4: 426). The mean demand over the last two periods is around 397, compared to the early periods which were much lower. Regarding lead time, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, which is higher than the promised 2 periods. Currently, 187 units are on-hand and 684 units (ordered Period 2) are in-transit. Since L=3, the Period 2 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). To ensure we cover demand for the review period (1) + lead time (3) = 4 periods, I will set L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (averaging ~320/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4); Demand regime shift detected starting P3: demand increased from ~155 to ~400.

Daily Reward (R_t): $748.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 3, increasing from an initial average of ~155 to over 430 in the last three periods (368, 426, 507). I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime. Regarding lead time, the P1 order arrived in P4, confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods instead of the promised 2. As of the end of P5, P2 is overdue (ordered P2, promised P4, expected P5 based on L=3, but 0 arrived in P5). This suggests lead time might be stretching to 4 or orders are being lost. Given the sequence (P2, P5) and on-hand inventory is 0, I will explicitly set L=4 to ensure the OR backend accounts for a longer pipeline requirement (1+L=5 periods of demand) and uses this to calculate the base stock. Setting gamma=0.3 for EWMA or N=3 for recent samples will allow us to catch the sharp upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3 confirmed: avg increased from ~155 to ~434 (+180%); Lead time instability: P1 arrived with L=3, P2 is currently overdue at L=3 (expected P5, not arrived).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a significant demand surge and lead-time instability. Demand has transitioned from a mean of ~155 (P1-P2) to a much higher regime, currently averaging ~484 over the last 4 periods (P3-P6: 368, 426, 507, 636) with clear upward momentum. Regarding lead time, the promised L=2 is being consistently exceeded. P1 arrived at L=3. P2 (ordered P2) is now due for L=4 evaluation as of the P6 conclude (it did not arrive in P5 or P6). With P2, P5, and P6 orders in transit, totaling 1778 units, and on-hand inventory at 0, we must adjust lead time parameters to account for the likely actual lead time of 4 or more. I will set L to 'explicit' 4 to ensure the OR engine calculations (1+L) cover a sufficient horizon. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand regime from Period 3 onwards, and for sigma_hat, N=4 will similarly capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability worsening: P2 order (placed Period 2) has not arrived as of Period 6 conclude, implying actual lead time is at least 4 periods. Demand continues to climb steeply: P5-P6 average is 571, compared to P3-P4 average of 397 (+43% increase).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently highly unstable. On the demand side, there has been a significant and sustained increase: Periods 1-2 averaged ~156, while Periods 3-7 averaged ~511, with recent periods (5-7) averaging ~587. On the supply side, the lead time has significantly diverged from the promised 2 periods. The Period 1 order arrived with L=3. The Period 2 order (due in P4 or P5) has still not arrived as of the end of P7, meaning the lead time is at minimum 5 periods (placed P2, hasn't arrived by P7 conclude), or the shipment is lost. Given the 'In-transit' quantity of 2454 units (Orders from P2, P5, P6, P7), we must account for a much longer lead time to protect against these stockouts. I will set L to 5 to reflect the current evidence and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the new high-growth regime (approx 511 units/period). This results in a mu_hat covering (1+5) periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at minimum 5 periods (P2 order not arrived as of P7 conclude). Demand regime stabilized at high level: P3-P7 avg is 511 units/period (+227% vs P1-P2).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 conclude, we finally observed the arrival of orders from P5 (L=3) and P7 (L=1). Crucially, the order from P2 (placed 6 periods ago) and P6 (placed 2 periods ago) are still missing. This confirms extreme lead time volatility rather than a consistent shift. Total in-transit is 1937, but the timing of these arrivals is unpredictable. Demand has continued to escalate: the mean of the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 634 units, a significant jump from the earlier regime. To ensure availability despite the unreliable supply chain, I am setting L to 4 (a conservative estimate given the missing P2 shipment) and using a recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~634 units/period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand, helping to buffer against the seen lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P5 arrived with L=3 and P7 arrived with L=1 in the same period, while P2 remains missing after 6 periods. Demand regime shift confirmed: P5-P8 average is 634 units (+24% versus P3-P7 average of 511).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3005.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial demand (P1-P2) averaged ~156 units, but has surged to an average of 740 units over the last three periods (P7-P9) and 803 units over the last two (P8-P9). I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this sustained high demand (approx 740 units/period). Lead time remains volatile: while the promised lead time is 2, we have seen actual lead times of 3 (P1, P5), 1 (P7, P8), and a missing shipment (P2). To prioritize availability and reflect the recent average of visible arrivals (L=1, 1, 3 -> avg 1.67), I will set L to 'calculate'. Since the 'calculate' method uses the average of all observed lead times, it serves as a robust middle ground for the OR backend given the high volatility and missing shipments. mu_hat is set to recent_3 to account for the current 740 unit/period demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high level: P7-P9 demand avg is 740 units (+41% vs P3-P7 avg). Lead time remains erratic but shows a recent trend of 1 period for P7 and P8 orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1276.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive and sustained increase. The most recent three periods (P8-P10) have seen demand average 866 units (775, 831, 993), confirming a transition to a significantly higher regime since the start of the game. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after failing to meet a demand of 993 in Period 10. Lead times are extremely volatile: promised at 2, but observed at 3, 1, and 1 recently, while the Period 2 and Period 6 orders appear lost or severely delayed (neither shown as arrived in concluding messages). To handle the high demand and lead time uncertainty, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand average ($866 	imes (1+L)$). L is set to 'explicit' at 2 to bridge the gap between the promised 2 and the volatile observations (some 1, some 3, some missing). This provides the backend with a realistic expectation of current volume while acknowledging that a lead time of 1 is too optimistic given the pattern of missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a very high level: P8-P10 demand avg is 866 units (+69% increase vs the P3-P7 avg of 511). Lead time volatility persists: though P7 and P8 arrived with L=1, the P2 and P6 orders are currently missing/overdue (P2 overdue by 6+ periods; P6 overdue by 2+ periods).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb sharply. The last 3 periods (P9-P11) averaged 987 units, while the peak demand reached 1136 in P11. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this hyper-growth. Lead time is highly erratic: P7 and P8 arrived in 1 period, but P2, P6, P10, and P11 are currently overdue or in transit. P2 is almost certainly lost. Given this unreliability, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a safety buffer in the base stock calculation (covering L+1=4 periods of demand). Total in-transit is 2765, which nominally covers 2-3 periods of demand, but since shipments like P2 and P6 appear lost or significantly delayed, and on-hand is 0, a high mu_hat and buffered L are necessary to trigger replenishment cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: P9-P11 average increased to 987 (+33% vs P7-P9 average of 740). Lead time remains erratic with high probability of lost shipments (P2 and P6 specifically).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a hyper-growth phase. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P10-P12) is 1144 units, a 16% increase over the previous 3-period average, and a massive increase over the early game. In-transit inventory remains high (2573 units), primarily consisting of the large orders from Period 12 and the likely lost/highly delayed shipments from Period 2 and Period 6. The most recent arrival (P10) achieved the promised lead time of 2, while the P9 shipment took 3. Given the erratic lead times (1 to 3+ periods), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer against delays, ensuring the base stock covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). For mu_hat, I'm using explicit to capture the forecasted growth: (1+3) * 1250 = 5000 units. For sigma_hat, I've adjusted volatility to account for both demand spikes and lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: P10-P12 avg demand is 1144 units (+16% vs P9-P11). Shipments P2 and P6 are now officially considered lost or indefinitely delayed as they have surpassed 10 and 6 periods respectively beyond their promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the average of the last 3 periods (P11-P13) reaching approximately 1204 units (1136, 1302, 1175). Period 13 demand dipped slightly but remains significantly higher than earlier regimes. Lead time is highly erratic: while P10 arrived with L=2 and P9 with L=3 in P12, P13 saw zero arrivals. Crucially, orders P2 and P6 remain missing and are likely lost. The current in-transit inventory is 4194 units, but because of the lost shipments (P2=684, P6=549), the 'effective' pipeline is likely lower. I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delays and use an explicit mu_hat reflecting a (1+L) * forecast of ~1250 units per period to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle the growth without over-ordering if things arrive simultaneously. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 400 to protect against the high variability in both demand and lead-time arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P11-P13 average demand is 1204 units (+5% over P10-P12 average of 1144). Lead time remains volatile and unreliable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods for successful arrivals while some orders remain lost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb rapidly, with the average demand over the last three periods (P12-P14) reaching approximately 1298 units, representing a sustained growth trend compared to the previous regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 5235 units in-transit. Lead times are extremely unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with orders from P2 and P6 now confirmed as lost. Recent successful arrivals (P9, P10, P11) arrived in 3, 2, and 3 periods respectively. Given the stockout situation and high demand, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of recent successful arrivals) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the replenishment gap. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand acceleration centered around ~1300 units/period. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with the higher demand levels. This should trigger a larger order to recover from the current stockout and buffer against lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P12-P14 average demand is ~1298 units (+8% over P11-P13 average of 1204). Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized between 2-3 periods recently (P9:3, P10:2, P11:3), though earlier orders (P2, P6) remain lost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise aggressively, with the most recent 3-period average (P13-P15) reaching 1342 units, a significant increase from earlier periods. The lead time for successful deliveries has recently stabilized at approximately 3 periods (P9: 3, P11: 3, P12: 3), though shipments P2, P6, and possibly P13 are currently missing or significantly overdue. Because we have 0 on-hand inventory and the demand trend is steeply upward, I am setting mu_hat to 1350 units per period (multiplied by 1+L) using the explicit method to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this growth. Sigma occupies a smaller proportion of the logic here but is set explicitly to 150 to account for demand volatility. L is set to 3 to reflect the realized lead time of recent successful shipments. The in-transit inventory of 4158 is large, but much of it likely consists of lost shipments (P2, P6, and possibly P10/P11 remnants) or future arrivals that haven't reached the 3-period mark, so a robust order level is still necessary to avoid stockouts in the face of 1300+ unit demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: P13-P15 average is 1342 units (+8% over P12-P14 avg). Lead time for typical arrivals is currently 3 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb with a clear upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) is 1477 units, and the single most recent period (P16) hit 1578. To avoid stockouts in this high-growth regime, I am setting mu_hat to 1600 units (scaled by L+1). Lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 3 periods (P11, P12, and P13 all arrived with L=3), so L is set to 3. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 150 to account for the increasing volatility observed during this demand surge. Orders P2 and P6 are still missing and are treated as lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard is likely inflated by these non-arriving units. Setting parameters to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period window (L+1) at the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P14-P16 average is 1477 units (+10% over P13-P15 average of 1342). Lead time for standard deliveries is now consistently 3 periods based on the last three successful arrivals (P11, P12, P13).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise aggressively, with the average demand from Period 15 to 17 being approximately 1533 units, representing a significant increase over previous periods. Currently, lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 3 periods (evident from Period 12, 13, and 14 orders), though Period 16 arrived surprisingly in just 1 period. To maintain a safe service level during this sustained growth, I am basing the demand forecast (mu_hat) on the most recent 3-period average (~1533 units/period). With a lead time (L) of 3, the target inventory must cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). My explicit mu_hat is set to 6132 (4 * 1533). I am keeping sigma_hat slightly elevated using 'recent_N' to account for demand volatility and lead-time inconsistency. Given the high pipeline and on-hand inventory, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach this base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P15-P17 average is 1533 units (+6% over P14-P16 average). Lead time for standard deliveries is consistently 3 periods, despite occasional 1-period anomalies (P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4380.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the P16-P18 average reaching 1675 units, reflecting a clear and sustained growth trend. On-hand inventory is currently depleted (0 units) following a demand of 1862 in Period 18. Regarding lead times, while Period 16 arrived in 1 period (P17 conclude), the structural lead time for planning should remains at 3 periods based on the consistent cluster of arrivals for P11, P12, P13, and P14. Total in-transit inventory is 5049, which includes the Period 15 order (now 4 periods old and potentially delayed/lost) and large orders from Periods 17 and 18. To account for the continuing demand acceleration and provide a buffer for lead-time volatility (L=3), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent steep ascent (averaging ~1675/period), and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen during this growth phase. This ensures the base stock level remains high enough to capture the peak demand while acknowledging the 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains on a steep trajectory: P16-P18 average is 1675 units (+14% over P14-P16 average of 1477). Regular lead time is established at 3 periods for successful deliveries despite occasional short-term anomalies.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise sharply. The average demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) is approximately 1733 units, representing a sustained growth trend from previous averages. Following the Carry-Over Insights, I will focus on the most recent regime. For mu_hat, I'm using an explicit value based on the latest 3-period average (1733) scaled for a review period plus the established lead time of 3 periods (Total multiplier = 4). This calculation (1733 * 4) yields 6932. Lead time (L) is explicitly set to 3 periods, as this has been the most consistent arrival window for successful deliveries over the last several cycles, despite occasional variability. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this rapid demand growth. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a high service level to capture the booming demand while accounting for the elongated lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains on a steep trajectory: P17-P19 average is 1733 units (+17% over the P14-P16 average of 1477). Lead time is established at 3 periods for the majority of successful deliveries.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the period 18-20 average reaching approximately 1881 units, representing an 8% increase over the previous three-period average. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time behaves erratically but is most consistently 3 periods for successful deliveries (P1, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14 and P16 all showed L=3 or L=1). I will set L to 3 to reflect the typical reality, which ensures our pipeline covers a longer horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. The large in-transit balance (7211) reflects several large recent orders (P17, P18, P19) that have not yet arrived, but are expected within the next 1-2 periods given L=3.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains on a steep trajectory: P18-P20 average is 1881 units (+8% over P17-P19). Regular lead time is established at 3 periods for the majority of successful deliveries.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the P18-P21 average reaching 1943 units, an increase of 30% over the previous three-period block and over 1000% higher than early periods. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 3 periods for successful deliveries, although there is a significant backlog with no arrivals in the last four periods (P18-P21). On-hand inventory is currently zero. To prevent massive stockouts during this hyper-growth phase and account for the observed lead time instability, I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I am using an explicit forecast of 8400, calculated as (1+L) * 2100 (anticipating a continued per-period increase from the current ~1943). For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 2000 (approx. sqrt(1+L) * 1000) to account for the extreme volatility in both demand and delivery schedules.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P18-P21 average demand reached 1943 units (+12% over P17-P19 avg of 1733). Significant delivery gap: No orders arrived from P18 through P21, despite an in-transit balance of nearly 8000 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the last four periods (P19-P22) averaging approximately 2,045 units, a significant increase from earlier phases. The supply chain is currently in a state of severe disruption: no orders have arrived since Period 17 (meaning orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, and P21 are all overdue relative to the expected 2-3 period lead time). This has resulted in a stockout since Period 18. The In-transit balance is extremely high (10,084 units), but none has reached the on-hand inventory. Given the persistent stockout and the accelerating demand (P22 reached 2,270), I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,300 per period (multiplied by 1+L by the backend) to ensure the target base stock reflects current peak demand rather than a historical average. I am setting L to 3 to align with the most frequent successful lead time, though actual reliability is currently zero. Sigma remains calculated from recent volatility (N=5) to account for the increasing demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply disruption: No arrivals recorded from Period 18 through Period 22 despite a pipeline of >10,000 units. Demand continues to accelerate, exceeding 2,200 units per period as of P22.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply disruption noted in Period 22-23 has cleared, with orders from P20, P21, and P22 arriving in a single batch (L=3, 2, and 1 respectively). This confirms the vendor is still operational but highly inconsistent. Demand has stabilized at a very high level, with the average of the last three periods (P21-P23) being ~2194 units. Given the erratic lead times (varying between 1 and 3 periods recently) and the clear upward trend, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory covers the maximum typical delay. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value of 8776, which represents (1+3) * 2194 to cover the lead time and current period. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility of the current demand regime. The high pipeline of 7002 units is recognized, but given the growth and demonstrated delivery gaps, maintaining a high base stock is necessary to avoid stockouts if another gap occurs.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption cleared in P23: Batch arrival of P20-P22 orders suggests vendor restores flow after gaps. Demand stabilized at ~2194 units/period (P21-P23 avg).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 24 demand hitting 2,504, bringing the recent 3-period average (P22-P24) to approximately 2,320 units. Lead times have been extremely volatile; while recent orders (P20-P22) arrived in a batch representing lead times of 1-3 periods, the delivery gap from P18-P22 created significant stockouts. Order P17 (1,847 units) is now 7 periods old and appears lost. P18 (1,808 units) and P19 (1,953 units) are 6 and 5 periods old respectively and are significantly overdue relative to the 3-period 'typical' lead time previously established. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the 8,218 units in transit (which includes likely lost orders), I am setting L to 3 (the consistent successful delivery window) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 9,400. This value is calculated as (1 + L) * 2350 (anticipated demand), which provides a buffer against the high stockout risk and the likelihood that a portion of the 'in-transit' pipeline will never arrive. Sigma_hat is set to 400 to account for recent high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: P22-P24 average is 2320 (+10% over P21-P23). Supply chain remains fragile: orders P17, P18, and P19 (totaling ~5,600 units) are significantly overdue and may be lost, despite the batch arrival of later orders in Period 23.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with the most recent 3-period average (P23-P25) reaching approximately 2,390 units, a ~23% increase over the P18-P20 average of 1,881. Lead time remains erratic but has stabilized for successful recent deliveries at approximately 3 periods (P21 at 2, P20 at 3, P22 at 1). Crucially, orders P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 5,608 units) have significantly exceeded the typical 3-period lead time and are now 8, 7, and 6 periods past their order date respectively; these are now treated as lost shipments and removed from the pipeline inventory calculation internally by using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to compensate for the fact that the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes them. I set L=3 based on recent successful delivery trends. For demand forecasting, I use 'explicit' for mu_hat at (1+3)*2400 = 9600 to ensure the base stock targets the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in the current high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Orders P17, P18, and P19 (total 5608 units) are confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed as of P25 conclude (passing 8, 7, and 6 periods respectively since order). Demand regime accelerated to ~2390 units/period (P23-P25 avg).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is experiencing a sustained and aggressive demand growth regime. The current average demand (P24-P26) is approximately 2,480 units per period. Lead time remains highly volatile, with recent successful deliveries (P20-P22) suggesting an average lead time 'L' of 3 periods, though orders P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 5,608 units) are now confirmed lost as they have exceeded 8 periods since placement. A total of 9,888 units are currently in-transit; however, 5,608 of these are lost, leaving an effective 'true' pipeline of 4,280 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand at ~2,480, the system must order enough to cover demand over (L+1) = 4 periods (approx 9,920 units). Subtracting the reliable pipeline (4,280 units) suggests a target order of ~5,640 units. I am setting L=3 to reflect the consistent lead time for arriving goods. mu_hat is set to 9920 (2480 * 4) and sigma_hat is set to 230 via 'explicit' methods to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment signal that compensates for the lost 5,608 units while accounting for the high demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P24-P26 average demand is 2480 units (+13% over P21-P23). Reliable Lead Time for arriving units is 3 periods despite high shipment loss rate.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a very high, sustained growth regime, with the average demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) reaching 2481 units. The supply chain remains highly unstable. We are currently facing a significant stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 are considered lost. The total 'In-transit' figure of 10114 includes these lost units (totaling 7500+ units), meaning the effective pipeline is much lower (~2600 units from P24-P27). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + review period at this higher demand level, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand plateau (+2480 per period). This will force a base stock calculation that accounts for the current high-demand environment while discounting lost units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated and stabilized: P24-P26 average demand is 2480 units (+13% over P21-P23). Strategic pipeline adjustment required: Over 7,500 units in 'In-transit' (from P2, P6, P17-P19) are confirmably lost/indefinitely delayed.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 28 recording a peak demand of 2890. The average demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) is approximately 2618. Supply chain performance remains highly erratic and prone to massive losses. Of the 9963 units currently listed as 'In-transit', the following orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on the carry-over history: P2 (684), P6 (549), P17 (1847), P18 (1808), and P19 (1953). This totals 6841 'phantom' units that will never arrive. Although P26 arrived with a lead time of 2, the pipeline is severely depleted because orders P24, P25, and P27 have not arrived yet. To compensate for the 6841 lost units and the accelerating demand, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 (the standard successful lead time) and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 10500. This mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * forecasted demand (4 * 2625), but I am slightly rounding up to ensure the backend triggers a significant catch-up order after internal logic subtracts the (mostly lost) pipeline inventory. This strategy aims to force an order that replenishes stock to meet the new >2600 unit-per-period demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline loss confirmed: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 (6841 units total) are considered lost and will not arrive. Demand growth has reached a new regime, exceeding 2600 units/period (P26-P28 avg).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively, with the most recent three-period average (P27-P29) hitting 2785 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this momentum. The lead time remains volatile; although recent arrivals (P26, P27) arrived in 2 periods, the history shows a dominant modal lead time and a more conservative estimate of 3 periods is safer to prevent stockouts given the supply chain fragility. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 11080 units is heavily inflated by 6841 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 which are now confirmed as lost. If these are not accounted for, the OR backend would drastically under-order. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' L=3 but will ensure the base stock calculation targets the current demand velocity. Given the lead time and demand trajectory, the backend needs to target a base stock covering approximately 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~11,140 units). After subtracting the 'effective' pipeline (11080 total - 6841 lost = 4239 real), the order should bridge the gap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of 6841 units from pipeline (P2, P6, P17-P19). Demand has reached a new regime exceeding 2700 units/period (P27-P29 avg: 2785).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb steeply, with a recent 3-period average (P28-P30) of 2951 units, representing a 6% increase over the previous 3-period average. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile, often settling at 3 periods, though recently appearing as 2. Most critically, the pipeline inventory of 11,555 units includes 6,841 units from periods P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 that are confirmably lost/indefinitely delayed. The OR backend is unaware of these losses and will 'under-order' if it thinks these 6,841 units are still arriving. To correct this, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative realistic lead time) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required target inventory to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand at ~2951 units/period = 11,804 units. After subtracting the 'true' pipeline (11,555 - 6,841 = 4,714), the gap is ~7,090 units. Setting mu_hat to 11,804 using 'explicit' forces the backend to recognize the need for a higher base stock despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P28-P30 average demand is 2951 units (+6% over P27-P29). Pipeline audit: 6841 units (orders P2, P6, P17-P19) remain lost; remaining viable pipeline is 4714 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise, with a recent 3-period average (P29-P31) of approximately 3,038 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; while the promised lead time is 2 periods, the effective L is closer to 3 for successful arrivals, and a significant portion of the 'In-transit' pipeline is permanently lost. Specifically, orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 6,841 units) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the OR backend's calculation. The viable pipeline is approximately 5,402 units (In-transit 12,243 - Lost 6,841). To compensate for the lost inventory and the accelerating demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent demand level (~3,100) and setting L to 3 to reflect the consistent arrival delay of functioning shipments. This ensures the base stock calculation target (L+1 periods) covers enough demand to prevent stockouts, while the cap helps moderate over-ordering if the vendor eventually resolves the bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P29-P31 average is 3038 units (+3% over P28-P30). Significant pipeline write-off: 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) are permanently lost. Viable pipeline is now 5402 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, with a recent average (P30-P32) of 3102 units/period, representing a significant increase from previous cycles. The lead time remains highly volatile, though recent successful deliveries have occurred within 1-2 periods (e.g., P31 arriving in P32). However, there is a substantial 'lost' component in the in-transit inventory (6841 units from P2, P6, P17-P19) which must be excluded to avoid the OR backend under-ordering. The viable pipeline is actually 5276 units (12117 total in-transit - 6841 lost). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the typical maximum reliable lead time and used 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand spike (average ~3100). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility. These settings aim to provide enough stock for the growing demand while acknowledging the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains on a very steep trajectory: P30-P32 average is 3102 units (+11% over P27-P29 avg of 2785). Pipeline integrity is low: 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) are confirmably lost and must be manually discounted when assessing inventory coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2248.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34, demand is in a steep upward trajectory, with the P31-P33 average reaching 3215 units (+15% vs the P27-P29 average). Lead times for successful deliveries (P31, P32) have recently shortened to 1 period, but overall lead time remains volatile and the risk of lost shipments is high. My pipeline audit reveals that 6,841 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Subtracting these from the total in-transit of 12,045 units leaves a viable pipeline of 5,204 units. Currently, on-hand is 0. To prevent stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods of demand (N=3) to capture the most recent level, and setting L=3 to maintain a safety buffer against the historical lead time average and the frequency of lost shipments. This targets a base stock that covers approximately 4 periods of the current demand level, adjusted for the missing pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains on a very steep trajectory: P31-P33 average is 3215 units (+15% over P27-P29 avg of 2785). Pipeline integrity is low: 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) are confirmably lost and must be manually discounted when assessing inventory coverage.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory, with the P32-P34 average reaching 3292 units, a significant increase from previous regimes. Lead time remains erratic; while the promised lead time is 2, recent successful arrivals (P26, P27, P31, P32) have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, while a large portion of the pipeline (6841 units from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) is confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 13,050 units includes these 6,841 lost units, meaning the viable pipeline is only 6,209 units. To compensate for the lost stock and the steep demand growth, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 13,200, which reflects a forecast of approximately 3,300 units per period over a 4-period horizon (L=3 to be safe given volatility + current period). sigma_hat is set explicitly to 600 to account for high volatility and to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains in an aggressive expansion phase: P32-P34 average is 3292 units (+18% vs P27-P29). Pipeline integrity remains the primary risk: 6841 units are confirmed lost, leaving a viable pipeline of 6209 units against an 'In-transit' display of 13050. Recent successful arrivals show lead times of 1-2 periods, but overall supply remains unstable.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a steep growth phase, with the most recent three periods (P33-P35) averaging 3450 units, up from the P30-P32 average of 3102 (+11%). Lead times for successful deliveries fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, though significant portions of the pipeline (6841 units from P2, P6, P17-P19) are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is reported at 13,705, but only 6864 units (13705 - 6841) are viable. To account for this supply gap and the continuing demand acceleration, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the latest demand peak (~3450/period). I will use L=3 to ensure a conservative safety buffer (L+1) given the frequent shipment losses and lead-time volatility. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 will capture the current high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P33-P35 average is 3450 units (+11% vs P30-P32). Significant pipeline loss of 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) persists and must be manually subtracted from the system's in-transit total during planning.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, with the average demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) reaching 3488 units, showing a 12% increase over the previous three-period average. My forecast needs to account for this continued upward trajectory. Lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently (P31:1, P32:1, P34:2), but given the history of stockouts and shipment losses, I will use a slightly more conservative lead time estimate of 2 periods to ensure sufficient stock. The critical operational task is accounting for the 'ghost' inventory: the system shows 13,126 units in-transit, but 6,841 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 10650 (representing a 3-period demand coverage of 3550 units/period), I am signaling to the OR backend that it needs to close the gap between the viable pipeline (approx. 6,285 units) and the required base stock, accounting for the 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P34-P36 average reached 3488 units (+12% vs P31-P33). Pipeline loss of 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) persists and must be manually subtracted from the system's in-transit total when determining true coverage.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, with a recent 3-period average (P35-P37) of 3632 units, an increase of approximately 4% over the previous 3-period average. To prevent stockouts, mu_hat is set to 'explicit' to project this growth forward across the lead time. The pipeline inventory requires significant adjustment: the system shows 12,045 units in-transit, but 6,841 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. This leaves a viable pipeline of only 5,204 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit value from its base_stock calculation, I am using an 'explicit' L of 5. This artificially raises the target base_stock to compensate for the ~6,800 unit 'ghost' inventory, ensuring the backend places an order large enough to cover real demand. Recent successful lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, but the primary constraint is the lost shipment gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P35-P37 average reached 3632 units (+4% vs P34-P36). Viable pipeline audit: Only 5204 units of the reported 12045 in-transit are likely to arrive, as 6841 units are permanently lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively. The P36-P38 average is 3780 units, compared to the P33-P35 average of 3450, showing a ~10% increase. Period 38 saw a peak demand of 4068. We are targeting a daily forecast (mu_hat) of 4100 units per period to keep pace with this trend. Regarding the pipeline, the system reports 16,067 units in-transit. However, historical audit (documented in Carry-over Insights) confirms 6,841 units (orders P2, P6, P17-P19) are permanently lost. The 'viable' pipeline is therefore 16067 - 6841 = 9226 units. To ensure the backend places an order that targets the correct base stock levels while accounting for these lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set L to 3 (the consistent lead time for recently successful arrivals) and mu_hat = (1+L) * 4100 = 16400. This compensates for the fact that the OR engine will otherwise over-count the lost units in the pipeline and under-order. Sigma_hat is set to 400 to account for rising volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P36-P38 average reached 3780 units (+10% vs P33-P35). Confirmed pipeline loss of 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) persists. True viable pipeline is in-transit minus 6841.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a sustained upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P37-P39) has reached 3959 units, which is a 14% increase over the P34-P36 average. Current demand per period is hovering around 4000 units. Regarding inventory, the system reports 13,052 units 'In-transit', but 6,841 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) are confirmably lost/indefinitely delayed. This leaves a 'true' viable pipeline of 6,211 units. The on-hand inventory is negligible at 29 units. Lead times for successful deliveries have recientemente been 1-2 periods (P38 arrived in 1 period, P35/P36 arrived in 2 periods). I am setting L=2 (explicit) to account for recent performance, mu_hat=12000 (explicit) to cover 3 periods of demand at ~4000/period, and sigma_hat=600 (explicit) to handle the high volatility in both demand and delivery reliability. This setting helps the OR backend realize the true inventory deficit caused by the 6,841 lost units and the accelerating demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P37-P39 average reached 3959 units (+14% vs P34-P36). Pipeline integrity audit: 6841 units from P2, P6, P17-P19 are permanently lost; true viable pipeline is 6211 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with the average demand over the last three periods (P38-P40) being approximately 3981 units. The supply chain remains extremely volatile. A total of 6,841 units in the 'In-transit' balance (specifically orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from inventory calculations to avoid under-ordering. The reported in-transit is 12045, but the 'viable' in-transit is only 5204 (12045 - 6841). Although the promised lead time is 2, recent successful arrivals (P38, P39) have arrived with a lead time of 1 period. To account for this volatility and ensure high service levels given the $4 profit, I am setting mu_hat to cover the recent average demand (approx 4000/period) across the review and a conservative lead time. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat because the OR backend's pipeline calculation will naturally see 12045 units; by setting a higher mu_hat, I effectively compensate for the 6841 phantom units in the backend's base-stock calculation. mu_hat target = (1+L)*(Forecast) + Lost_units = (1+2)*4000 + 6841 = 18841.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline loss persists: 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) are permanently lost and must be subtracted from systemic 'In-transit' to find true coverage. Current demand regime stabilized at ~4000 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a very high regime, with an average of approximately 4000 units per period over the last few observations (P38-P41 average is 3985). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system reports an in-transit balance of 18,715 units. However, consistent history shows that 6841 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) are permanently lost. Subtracting these leaves a viable pipeline of 11,874 units. The OR backend uses an inventory-based order policy (Base Stock - Pipeline), but it does not know about lost shipments. To prevent the OR backend from 'under-ordering' by counting lost units as valid supply, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at a level that accounts for both the demand and the pipeline correction. Specifically, I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods plus compensate for the 6841 units the system thinks I have but I don't. While actual lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, a planning lead time of 2 is appropriate for the backend. I select mu_hat = (observed avg demand * (L+1)) + lost_units = (4000 * 3) + 6841 = 18841. Sigma_hat is set to 450 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4000 units/period (P38-P41 avg). Systemic 'In-transit' includes 6841 units from P2, P6, P17-P19 that are confirmed lost; these must be offset by increasing mu_hat explicitly.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 4,000 units per period (average of P38-P42 is 4,007). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 19,220 units; however, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that 6,841 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19) are permanently lost. Therefore, the true viable pipeline is 12,379 units (19,220 - 6,841). This viable pipeline consists of orders P41 (6,670), P42 (505), and some older unreceived orders from the P24-P30 range which are increasingly suspect but not yet fully written off. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a mode of 2 in recent successful cycles. To ensure the OR engine maintains sufficient inventory despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure and the high demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * demand. With L=2, required coverage is 3 * 4,000 = 12,000 units. To compensate for the 6,841 units the OR engine *thinks* are coming (but aren't), I must increase the mu_hat parameter. Setting mu_hat to 6,300 (per period equivalent of 18,900 for L=2) forces the engine to recognize the supply gap and place necessary replenishment orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4000 units/period (P38-P42 avg). Systemic 'In-transit' includes 6841 units from P2, P6, P17-P19 that are confirmed lost; these must be offset by increasing mu_hat explicitly.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime centered around 4,000 to 4,500 units per period. The recent three-period average (P41-P43) is approximately 4,171 units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 4400 (using L=3, so 4 * 4400 = 17600) to account for the current demand level and ensure sufficient base stock. The systemic 'In-transit' figure of 19,220 is heavily inflated by 6,841 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 which are confirmed lost. The true viable pipeline is approximately 12,379 units. Since the OR backend uses the systemic 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - in_transit), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that compensates for the lost units. Setting mu_hat to 26,061 (Base stock of ~26k - 19.2k in-transit = ~6.8k order) would effectively 're-order' the lost units. However, to maintain a safe service level against the current demand of ~4400, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 26,100. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent lead time for successful arrivals, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the high regime of 4000-4500 units (Period 41-43 avg: 4171). Pipeline loss of 6841 units remains the critical calculation factor.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand reached a new high of 4,470 units. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P42-P44) is approximately 4,329 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime consistently above 4,000 units. The lead time for the P41 order was 3 periods. Although some recent orders showed 1-2 periods, a 3-period lead time is the safer planning horizon (L=3), particularly given the fragility shown in historical supply gaps. The crucial planning constraint remains the systemic 'In-transit' figure of 19,698 units, which includes 6,841 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 that are confirmed as permanently lost. After accounting for on-hand inventory (2,200) and subtracting the lost units from in-transit, the viable pipeline is approximately 12,857 units. To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~17,316 units needed) despite the phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' count, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 24,000 (calculated as (1+L) * 4400 + 6400 offset) to effectively 'neutralize' the lost units and maintain an aggressive base stock near 17,200 units of real coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10820.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, with the Period 43-45 average reaching ~4497 units, a significant increase from the ~4000 unit baseline seen in the previous regime. Lead times for successful deliveries have reconciled at 3 periods (P41 arrived at P44, P42 arrived at P45). However, a critical inventory deficit exists because 6,841 units in the systemic 'In-transit' total (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. As of Period 46, systemic In-transit is 21,732, meaning the true viable pipeline is 14,891 units. With On-hand at 0, we must cover at least 4 periods of demand (L+1 = 4). Estimated demand for the next 4 periods is roughly 18,000 units (4500 * 4). To compensate for the 6,841 unit phantom inventory that the OR engine will subtract from its base stock calculation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 24,841 (calculated as: 4500 average per period * 4 periods = 18,000 baseline, + 6,841 to offset the lost units). This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to meet future demand despite the inaccurate pipeline data. L is set to 3 to reflect the current physical lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 43: average demand increased from ~4000 to ~4500 (+12.5%). Pipeline audit: 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) remain permanently lost; manual offset in mu_hat is required to bypass systemic in-transit calculation error.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a high-demand regime that shifted at Period 43, with the average demand over P43-P46 being approximately 4533 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 25276 includes 6841 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the viable pipeline is actually 18435 units (25276 - 6841). Recent successful arrivals (P41, P42) show lead times of 3 periods, though lead time remains somewhat volatile. To ensure sufficient coverage for a 3-period lead time (L=2 plus current period protection), the system needs to maintain stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At the current demand rate of ~4533, that's a total requirement of ~13600 units. Since the viable pipeline (18435) already exceeds this, the 'mu_hat' is set explicitly to 14200 (approx 4733 per period for 3 periods) to account for recent growth and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated in-transit figure. Setting sigma_hat explicitly at 600 reflects the recent demand volatility around the mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P43-P46 average demand reached 4533 units (+9% vs P38-P41). Viable pipeline audit: 6841 units (P2, P6, P17-P19) are permanently lost; manual offset in mu_hat is necessary to correctly factor in this loss against the systemic in-transit total.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a very high regime, with the Period 43\u201347 average reaching 4617 units, significantly above previous levels. Inventory is currently 0, and we are facing a critical supply chain calculation error: the system reports 'In-transit' as 25276, but 6841 of these units (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and will not arrive. This leaves a viable pipeline of approximately 18435 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock using a Lead Time of 3 (the most frequent recent successful delivery time) and a demand forecast of 4800 units/period to account for current momentum. Target coverage (L+1) = 4 * 4800 = 19200 units. To offset the 6841 'phantom' units that the OR backend will deduct from this target, I increase mu_hat by that exact amount. \u03bc\u0302 = (19200 + 6841) / 4 = 6510. This forces the system to order against the true available stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P43-P47 average demand is 4617 units (+10% vs P38-P42). Total confirmed pipeline loss of 6841 units remains the pivotal planning constraint.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the penultimate period of the simulation. Demand has stabilized in a high regime, with the average demand from Period 43-48 being approximately 4734 units. The reported 'In-transit' balance of 25,276 is heavily distorted by 6,841 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 that are confirmed lost. The actual viable pipeline is approximately 18,435 units (systemic 25,276 - 6,841). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the last few successful arrivals (P41 arrived in P44, P42 arrived in P45), the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. To ensure we have enough stock for the final period (Period 50), we must account for the fact that an order placed now (P49) with a 3-period lead time will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, our primary objective is to set parameters that ensure the OR backend utilizes the existing viable pipeline to cover the 2 periods of demand (P49 and P50). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 4800 = 19200 (using L=3) to reflect the recent demand peak, and sigma_hat to 600 to provide a sufficient safety buffer. By using an explicit mu_hat and L=3, the backend will calculate the required base stock and subtract the (distorted) pipeline; however, since the viable pipeline is already large (~18k), significant new orders are unlikely to trigger, which is appropriate as they wouldn't arrive in time for Period 50 anyway.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P43-P48 average is 4734 units (+18% vs P38-P42). Reliable lead time L=3 confirmed by P41 and P42 arrivals.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high regime, with the average demand from Period 43 to Period 49 being approximately 4,734 units. However, the system is facing a massive 'inventory ghost' problem: 6,841 units from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 are permanently lost but still count towards the systemic 'In-transit' figure of 25,276. This leaves a true viable pipeline of 18,435 units. Additionally, the lead time has stabilized at L=3 (observed for P41 and P42 arrivals). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient quantities despite the inflated in-transit numbers, mu_hat must be set explicitly to cover the (L+1) period demand plus an offset for the lost units. With L=3, the (L+1) demand window is 4 periods, which at 4,734 units/period equals ~18,936 units. Adding the 6,841 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 25,777. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of the 4-period demand to maintain a high service level given the supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time L=3 confirmed by P41 and P42 arrivals. True viable pipeline is systemic 'In-transit' minus 6,841 lost units (P2, P6, P17-P19). Demand regime stabilized at ~4734 units/period.
