The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) should arrive at the start of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend from P1 (107) to P5 (544). Averaging the last three known data points (298, 376, 544) gives a recent mean of approximately 406 units per period. Since I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (P1, P2, and P3) to account for the lead-time gap, and current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I must place a substantial order. Assuming a forward-looking average demand of ~450-500 to account for the growth trend, I need roughly 1350-1500 units to bridge the gap until the P1 order arrives. I will order 1350 units to establish a pipeline and meet the surging demand discovered in the historical samples.",

The average demand over the first three periods is approx 227, with a very high recent peak of 368.

However, in the Period 3 conclude message, it shows 'arrived=0', which is expected as the order arrives after the P3 decision. We expect the 1350 units to arrive during Period 4 (visible at P5 start). Pipeline analysis: P1 order (1350) + P2 order (400) = 1750 units in transit. Since L=2, an order placed now (P4) arrives during P6. We need to cover demand for P4, P5, and P6. Cumulative demand for P1-P3 was 680 units (all lost sales).

The overall trend suggests a demand level of approximately 1300-1450 for P14-P17. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand). The 'In-transit' pipeline is 6050 units, consisting of P11 (1500), P12 (1650), and P13 (1800). Based on recent lead times (P9 was 3 periods, P10 was 2 periods), I expect P11 to arrive in Period 14 (L=3) and P12 to arrive in Period 14 or 15. Orders P2 and P6 remain lost. To protect against stockouts given the L+1 (3-4 periods) lead-time horizon and aggressive growth, I target available stock (on-hand + incoming) to cover demand for the next 4 periods (~5500-6000 units). With 6050 in transit (assuming no further losses), current coverage is high, but the risk of stockouts during the wait for P11 is high. I will place a significant order of 2000 units to maintain the buffer against continued growth and potential shipment losses, as the penalty for stockouts ($19) far outweighs the holding cost ($1).",

While P39 demand (3993) was slightly lower than P38 (4068), the overall trend remains elevated between 3,500 and 4,100 units per period. The primary risk remains the systemic shipment loss rate, which has historically been around 40-50%, although recent reliability has improved with P34, P35, P36, and P38 arriving. Actual lead times for successful orders fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P38 arrived in 1 period, P34/P35 in 2 periods). Order P37 (4500 units) is currently 2 periods old and has not arrived; based on recent patterns, it is either arriving this period (P40) or potentially lost. With an on-hand inventory of 2,665 and expected demand around 4,000, I am at risk of a stockout if P37 or P39 do not arrive during this period's resolution.
