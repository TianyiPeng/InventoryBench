Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend over the last 5 historical samples (107, 252, 298, 376, 544). The latest demand is 544, which is more than double the average of the first four periods. Given this strong growth phase, using all historical samples (default) would underestimate future demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent growth trend (average of 298, 376, 544 is ~406). The promised lead time is 2, so the system will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*406 = 1218. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. L is set to default (promised lead time) until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 613 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). The demand in Period 1 was 134, but since we had 0 on-hand inventory, we sold 0 units. The historical demand data shows a significant upward trend: P1 (107), P2 (252), P3 (298), P4 (376), P5 (544). Note: The user-provided 'GAME HISTORY' for P1 shows demand=134, which differs from the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' sample of 107; I will prioritize the provided samples for forecasting as they show a clear growth trajectory. Currently, we have 613 units in transit. Given the rapid growth (doubling nearly every two periods), a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is selected to capture this momentum while maintaining some stability. Lead time is kept at 'default' (2) as no contradicting evidence yet exists.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 613 units; we expect these to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase (becoming visible at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, and we have missed demand in Periods 1 and 2. Demand is showing a significant upward trend: P1=107 (original data)/134 (actual), P2=252/225, and historical samples (P3-P5) suggest even higher future demand (up to 544). To account for this growth, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=2 to focus on the immediately preceding demand levels, and default for others to allow the OR backend to handle variance and the promised 2-period lead time. Pipeline inventory (1304) is high enough to satisfy the base stock once arrivals start.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a clear and rapid upward trend: P1:107 (pre-game), P2:252, P3:298, P4:376, P5:544. Note: There is a discrepancy between the demand history provided in the system prompt (P1-P5) and the 'conclude' messages (P1-P3). I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages for sold/on-hand status but the provided historical list (P1-P5) for forecasting the trend. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (613 units) should arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units despite demand, we are in a stockout. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the trend is aggressively increasing (approx +30-50% per period). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects the growth needed to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $967.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Looking at the history, the promised lead time was 2, but the order from Period 1 arrived at the conclusion of Period 4, meaning the actual lead time was 3 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 297, and there is one large order of 691 units in-transit (placed in Period 2). If the lead time remains 3, that order should arrive at the conclusion of Period 5. Demand has shown a significant upward trend: P1: 134, P2: 225, P3: 338, P4: 316 (avg ~253). However, the latest samples (P3, P4) suggest a higher regime around 320-330 units. To account for the observed lead time of 3 (making the coverage window L+1 = 4 periods), I will set L to explicit 3. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the recent demand surge (avg of P2-P4 is 293, so mu_hat will be ~1172). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N of 3 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 3 periods (P1 order arrived conclusion of P4); Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2, increasing from ~130 to ~300+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1188.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a clear upward trend (134, 225, 338, 316, 479). The average demand over all periods is 298, but the last 3 periods average 377, indicating a significant growth regime. Lead time analysis: An order placed in Period 1 arrived at the conclusion of Period 4, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 3, despite the promised lead time of 2. I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher demand level (averaging 377 per period), which results in a mu_hat of approximately 1508. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture volatility across the growth phase. This combination aims to build safety stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: avg demand increased from 200 in P1-P2 to 377 in P3-P5 (+88%). Actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (P1 order arrived conclusion of P4).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand is showing a rapid upward trend: P1 (134), P2 (225), P3 (338), P4 (316), P5 (479), P6 (616). The mean of the last 3 periods is 470, while the overall mean is 351. Due to this accelerating demand, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to catch this growth, though the OR cap will modulate the total order. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2, but the only concluded order (P1) arrived in P4, indicating an actual lead time (L) of 3. I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the 4-period risk horizon (L+1). On-hand is currently 0, and we have 1567 units in-transit (orders from P2, P5, P6). The P2 order (691 units) is expected to arrive during Period 7 resolution because L=3 (P2+3=5, conclusion seen at P6 sequence, but it hasn't arrived yet; checking history: P1 order arrived at conclusion of P4, implying P1+(L=3)=4). Wait, if P1 arrived at conclusion of P4, then P2 should have arrived at conclusion of P5 (P2+3=5). Since P2 did NOT arrive in P5 or P6, it is currently overdue, which increases stockout risk. I will maintain L=3 and use recent statistics to bolster the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P4-P6 average is 470 (+33% over P1-P6 mean). P2 order (691 units) is overdue (expected conclusion P5 if L=3).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state due to delayed shipments and an accelerating demand trend. Lead time analysis: Promised L=2, but the only concluded order (P1) had an actual L=3. The P2 order (placed in P2) is now 3 periods late (should have arrived conclusion of P5 if L=3) and 6 periods since ordering. However, it is still listed in 'In-transit', suggesting a severe lead-time drift or delay rather than a lost order yet. Demand analysis: There is a clear upward trend (P1: 134, P2: 225, P3: 338, P4: 316, P5: 479, P6: 616, P7: 687). The mean of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is ~524. Setting L to 'explicit' at 4 to account for the observed delays and ensure the OR engine calculations (which use 1+L for base stock) protect against the current logistics volatility. mu_hat is set to 2620 ((1+4)*524) to reflect the recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is set to 250 (approx sqrt(5)*111) to account for high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P2 order significantly overdue (6 periods since order, 3 periods past observed L=3). Demand trend continues positive: P5-P7 average is 594, a 76% increase over P1-P4 average.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 8 reaching 800 units. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is 701, which is significantly higher than the overall average. Lead time is highly volatile: we observed a 3-period lead time for the P1 and P5 orders, a 1-period lead time for the P7 order, and the P2 order (691 units) is now 7 periods overdue and likely lost. The in-transit inventory is high (1978 units), but given the high stockout risk and the lost P2 shipment, we must ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current high-demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~700/period) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed leap-frogging lead times (3, 3, 1). This should help the OR engine maintain a safety buffer against the erratic delivery and rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P6-P8 average is 701 (+18% vs P5-P7 average). Lead time volatility: P7 order arrived in 1 period, while P5 took 3 periods and P2 remains lost after 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2996.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb rapidly, with the last 4 periods averaging 761 units (P6: 616, P7: 687, P8: 800, P9: 943). The most recent period (P9) saw demand hit 943. Lead times are highly volatile: P7 and P8 arrived in just 1 period, while P5 took 3 periods, and P2 (ordered 8 periods ago) is effectively lost. Despite having 2136 units in transit, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and previous lost sales indicate we are under-ordered relative to the growth trend. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent observed delays and buffer against volatility. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand spike (averaging approx 810/period) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in demand over the last half of the observed history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P7-P9 average is 810 (+36% over P4-P6 mean). Lead time remains erratic: though P7 and P8 arrived in 1 period, P5 took 3 and P2 is confirmed lost (8 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a strong upward trend, with the last three periods (P8-P10) averaging 921 units, compared to the P5-P7 average of 594 (+55%). Current Period 10 demand was 1021. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to project a per-period demand of approximately 921, which for (1+L) results in 3684 (using an estimated effective L=3 to account for historical variability). Lead time remains highly erratic: while P7 and P8 arrived in 1 period, P5 took 3, and P2 (ordered 9 periods ago) is lost. I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the risk of longer arrivals and lost shipments, ensuring the OR backend targets a pipeline that covers 4 periods of demand. This is crucial as on-hand inventory is currently 0 and backlogged demand is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P8-P10 average is 921 (+55% over P5-P7 mean). Lead time remains erratic and unreliable with recent arrivals ranging from 1 to 3 periods and P2 confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU shows a clear and aggressive growth trend in demand. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P9-P11) is approx 1053 units, compared to 810 in the previous 3-period block (P7-P9), confirming a sustained upward trajectory. Lead times are extremely unstable: while some orders arrive in 1 period (P7, P8), others take 3 (P1, P5), and the P2 order (691 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and a massive backlog of demand leading to stockouts, I need to set mu_hat to account for the most recent demand regime and use a conservative lead time. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the (1+L)=3 periods of demand at the current rate of ~1150 units/period (3450 total) to ensure the OR backend generates sufficient order volume despite the pipeline inventory of 3971 (which includes the lost P2 order and several pending shipments from P6, P9, P10, and P11). Setting mu_hat explicitly and increasing sigma_hat helps handle the high volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P9-P11 average demand is 1053 units (+30% vs P7-P9 average). Lead time remains bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, with P2 order (691 units) definitely lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with the P9-P11 average reaching 1053 units, reflecting a ~30% increase compared to the P7-P9 window. The lead time remains highly volatile, showing a bifurcated pattern of 1-3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2). The P2 order is confirmed lost. To manage this volatility and the steep demand climb, I am setting L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the longest observed successful lead time. For mu_hat, I am using an explicit forecast of 1150 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=4, totaling 4600) to account for the sustained growth not yet fully captured by historical averages. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased variance seen in the recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this high-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P10-P12 average demand is ~1117 units (+38% vs P7-P9 average). Lead time volatility persists with recent arrivals taking 2-3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory, with the P11-P13 average reaching approximately 1237 units, representing a significant increase over previous windows. Demand is consistently outstripping supply, leading to zero ending inventory in Period 13 and lost sales. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2, and the P11 order is currently at L=3 without arrival confirmation). Given this instability, I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the longest likely lead time. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 5000 units (representing (1+L)*1250) to account for the current demand level plus the anticipated continued growth. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 600 (approx. sqrt(1+3)*300) to provide a substantial buffer against both the high demand variance and the delivery uncertainty (lead-time risk).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P11-P13 average demand is ~1237 units (+15% vs P9-P11 average). Lead time remains volatile, with the P11 order (734 units) currently overdue if L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2936.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with the most recent 3-period average (P12-P14) reaching 1281 units, representing a sustained growth regime. The inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand and high lost sales. Lead times remain unstable, with the most recent arrival (P11 order) taking 3 periods, while previous orders ranged from 1 to 3 periods. Given the high stockout risk and the recent 3-period lead time observation, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient look-ahead period (L+1). For demand (mu_hat), I am using a 3-period average (recent_N=3) to capture the most current high-demand state (~1281/period), which the OR backend will scale by (1+L). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility seen in the current growth phase. Note: The P2 order remains lost and is no longer expected to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth momentum is sustained: P12-P14 average demand is 1281 units (+15% vs P10-P12 average). Lead time remains volatile but leans towards 3 periods recently (P11 order arrived in P14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Comparing recent periods, the average demand for P13-P15 is approximately 1460 units, which is a significant increase over the P11-P13 average of 1237 mentioned in earlier insights. This represents a sustained growth regime. Lead times remain erratic, with observed values ranging from 1 to 3 periods; most recently, we've seen arrivals taking 3 periods (P11) or being delayed (P13, P14). I will set L to 3 to account for the longer side of this volatility and ensure the pipeline inventory covers the necessary duration. For mu_hat, I'll use an explicit forecast of 1550 units per period (base demand) multiplied by (1+L) to anticipate the continued growth seen in Period 15 (1672 units). Sigma_hat will be set explicitly to reflect the high volatility observed during this growth phase. The goal is to aggressively build inventory to meet the soaring demand and mitigate frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: P13-P15 average demand is ~1460 units (+18% vs P11-P13). Lead time remains volatile, centering around 3 periods for recent consistent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5632.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 16 demand was 1,542, and the average for the last three periods (P14-P16) is 1,513, up from 1,281 in the prior regime. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility estimation. Regarding lead time, the P13 order arrived in 3 periods, and the P11 order also took 3 periods, confirming a shift back to a longer lead time (L=3) compared to the erratic 1-2 period arrivals seen earlier. I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the correct length of the pipeline (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). The goal is to elevate the base stock to match this new demand regime and compensate for the 3-period lead time, aiming to reduce the stockouts seen in Periods 13, 15, and 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P14-P16 average demand is 1,513 units (+18% vs P12-P14). Lead time has stabilized around 3 periods for the most recent two arrivals (P11 and P13 both took 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5411.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly. The average demand of the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 1,634 units, representing a sustained growth trend compared to earlier periods. Lead times remain erratic but have settled into a pattern of either 1 or 3 periods (P13, P14 both arrived in 3 periods; P16 arrived in 1 period). I will set L to 3 to account for the longer, more conservative arrival window to prevent stockouts during this high-growth phase. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most current and aggressive demand regime (averaging ~1634 per period). This translates to a mu_hat of 6536 units (1,634 * (1+3)). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high volatility observed in the latest period samples. These parameters allow the OR backend to target a high service level while the on-hand inventory (1337) and in-transit units (3324) are used to satisfy current and upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P15-P17 average demand is 1,634 units (+30% vs P12-P14 average). Lead time remains bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent multi-period arrivals (P11, P13, P14) averaging 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive growth, with the average of the last 3 periods (P16-P18) reaching approximately 1674 units, which is a 30% increase compared to the P12-P14 window. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times are volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; most recently, orders from P13, P14, and P16 arrived with lead times of 3, 3, and 1 respectively. Because lead time remains unpredictable but frequently hits 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for enough pipeline inventory (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). Given the clear upward trend, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand regime and its associated volatility. This strategy aims to prevent stockouts during this high-growth phase, even if it results in temporary holding costs should multiple orders arrive simultaneously.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P16-P18 average demand is ~1674 units (+30% vs P12-P14). Lead time remains erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods in recent cycles.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 19 demand reached 1,986 units. The 3-period average (P17-P19) is approximately 1,822 units, which is a significant increase (~11%) over the P16-P18 average. Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with most multi-period arrivals settling at 3 periods (e.g., P1, P5, P9, P11, P13, P14). I am setting L=3 to ensure sufficient safety stock for the longer lead time realization. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value based on the most recent demand level (approx 1,850 per period) scaled by (1+L) = 4, resulting in 7,400. This accounts for the sustained rapid growth. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to reflect the high volatility observed during this growth phase, using a standard deviation of approximately 250 per period scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2, resulting in 500. On-hand is currently 0 with significant in-transit inventory, but the parameters must remain high to trigger orders that keep pace with the ~2000 units/period demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P17-P19 average is 1,822 units (+11% vs P16-P18). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods, which should be treated as the effective planning horizon.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the average demand for the most recent three periods (P18-P20) reaching approximately 1,885 units. This represents a sustained increase compared to previous regimes. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods (e.g., P1, P5, P9, P11, P13, P14). To avoid stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting L to 3 to cover the common upper bound of the actual lead time. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (averaging ~1,885 per period). Given L=3, the OR backend will calculate the base stock for (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed in the most recent peak demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P18-P20 average is 1,885 units (+14% vs P15-P17). Lead time is volatile but frequently achieves 3 periods, making L=3 the necessary planning horizon for safety.

The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a massive pipeline of 7,821 units. Lead time remains highly erratic, appearing to alternate between 1 and 3 periods, or longer. The system hasn't seen an arrival since Period 17 (P14 and P16 orders). The orders from P15 (907 units), P17 (1,135 units), P18 (1,765 units), P19 (1,820 units), and P20 (912 units) are all in-transit. To protect against the consistent 3rd-period arrival pattern seen in history and the accelerating demand, I will set L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most aggressive recent demand growth (avg ~1,952), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the high growth rate plus the extended lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P19-P21 average is 1,952 units (+4% vs P18-P20). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods, necessitating a planning horizon of L=3 for inventory security.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of extreme acceleration. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) show demand of 1875, 1995, and 2218, with P19 also at 1986. The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 2018.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead times remain highly volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods (e.g., P11, P13, P14 orders). To ensure coverage over the necessary planning horizon (L+1 = 4 periods) and account for recent growth, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) which segments the newest and highest demand regime (~2029 units/period). I am setting L to explicit value 3 to protect against the frequent 3-period arrivals and lost order risks. Sigma_hat is calculated over the last 5 samples to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: P20-P22 average is 2029 units (+10% vs P17-P19). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods, requiring L=3 for all planning calculations to avoid stockouts.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively, with the most recent sample at Period 23 reaching 2,449 units. The average demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) is 2,221 units, representing a significant 10-15% increase over the previous three-period average. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P20 arrived in 3 periods, P22 arrived in 1 period). To prevent the recurring stockouts observed (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting L=3 to cover the upper bound of the observed lead time, ensuring sufficient pipeline inventory. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current and aggressive phase of the growth trend, prioritizing responsiveness to the rapid demand increase over long-term stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: P21-P23 average is 2,221 units (+10% vs P18-P20). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods; maintaining L=3 for planning is essential to counter recurrent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 24 demand reached 2,460 units, and the average demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) is approximately 2,376 units, confirming a sustained regime shift. Lead time remains erratic, with recent arrivals occurring at 1 or 3 periods (P20 took 3, P22 took 1). To prevent stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting L=3 to cover the longer observed lead-time boundary. I'm using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most current, significantly higher demand levels (~2,376 per period), resulting in a base stock calculation centered on (1+3) * 2376. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the most recent demand acceleration and potential lead-time delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P22-P24 average is 2,376 units (+20% vs P20-P22). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; maintaining L=3 for planning is critical for inventory continuity.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent sample at Period 25 reaching 2,309 units and the P23-P25 average around 2,406 units. Given the persistent growth, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the latest demand regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P23 arrived in 2 periods, while P20 took 3 and P22 took 1). To remain conservative and avoid further stockouts, I will set L to an explicit value of 3. This ensures the base stock calculation covers a 4-period window (L+1), which is necessary because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are relying on a large pipeline of 9,266 units (which includes some likely lost or severely delayed orders from P15-P19) to fulfill upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P23-P25 average is 2,406 units, showing sustained high volume despite stockouts. Lead time remains unreliable, recently varying between 1, 2, and 3 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the P24-P26 average demand reaching approximately 2,399 units per period. The supply chain remains extremely stressed, as evidenced by 'zero' ending on-hand inventory in almost all recent periods and frequent stockouts. Lead times are highly erratic, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods; for planning safety, L=3 must be used as the base to account for the longer arrival possibility which has occurred frequently (P4, P8, P12, P14, P16, P17, P20, P23). I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover (1 + L) periods of the most recent demand average (approx 2,400 per period * 4 periods = 9,600). I am opting for 10,000 to proactively handle the continued upward trend. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of the forecasted demand to provide a necessary buffer against the high variance and lead time uncertainty, ensuring the OR backend aims for a high service level to recover from the chronic stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P24-P26 average is 2,399 units (+10% vs P20-P22). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for planning to mitigate chronic stockouts.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, with the average demand for the most recent period reaching 2,565 units. The P24-P26 average is approx 2,399 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; however, planning for the maximum observed lead time (L=3) is critical to capturing demand given the frequent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L=4) * 2500 = 10000. sigma_hat is set to 1500 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high variance and the risk of lost or delayed shipments (like the P2 order). The pipeline inventory is very high (11263), but since on-hand is 0, we must maintain high parameters to ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment if the pipeline isn't sufficient to cover the 4-period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P25-P27 average is 2,433 units (+9% vs P22-P24). Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), reaffirming L=3 as the necessary planning horizon to mitigate chronic stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb aggressively, with the most recent sample (P28) reaching 2,733 units. The average demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) is 2,575 units, a significant increase from the already high levels recorded in earlier periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there is a large pipeline of 10,763 units, lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P26 order arrived in 2 periods, while P23 took 2 and P15-P20 arrivals consistently hit 3). P2 remains permanently lost. To ensure inventory continuity under this growth and volatility, I am maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon. I am setting mu_hat to reflects the most recent 3-period regime (P26-P28) to stay synchronized with the accelerating demand, and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the increased volatility in this high-volume stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P26-P28 average is 2,575 units (+15% vs P22-P24). Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods; maintaining L=3 is necessary for safety stock calculations.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the P27-P29 average reaching approximately 2,738 units, compared to the P26-P28 average of 2,575. We are in a state of chronic stockouts (P28 and P29 ended at 0 on-hand). Lead times remain highly volatile, with recent arrivals (P26, P27) taking 2 periods, while previous sequences often took 3. To maintain service levels and prevent stockouts during this extreme growth phase, I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory pipeline accounts for the maximum observed lead time. I'll use a 3-period window for mu_hat (recent_N=3) to capture the most recent demand acceleration (~2,738 per period). For sigma_hat, a 5-period window is used to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. The large in-transit balance (9,266) reflects aggressive ordering in previous periods (P24 order of 1,889 is still outstanding), but given zero on-hand and rising demand, maintaining the base stock level at the current growth rate is critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: P27-P29 average reached 2,738 units (+6% vs P26-P28). Lead time remains erratic but suggests a 2nd consecutive 2-period arrival; however, L=3 remains the safest planning horizon to buffer against frequent volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience an aggressive demand uptrend, with the average demand for the last 3 periods (P28-P30) reaching 2,838 units. Inventory remains critical with current on-hand at 0 and significant lost sales. Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; for safety, I am maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure the 'base stock' covers the full duration of potential delivery delays + the order period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent level of this accelerating growth regime. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock level (target pipeline) that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1), effectively targeting a high service level (80% critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Sustained aggressive demand growth confirmed; P28-P30 average demand is 2,838 units (+15.6% vs P24-P26 average). Effective planning lead time remains L=3 due to continued arrival volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb aggressively, with Period 31 demand reaching 3,137 units. The average demand for the last three periods (P29-P31) is 2,973 units, representing a significant increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; for planning purposes, L=3 is maintained to ensure the OR backend captures enough pipeline inventory to cover the (L+1) horizon. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in a chronic stockout state. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods to capture the latest volume spike and using explicit sigma_hat to reflect high volatility during this growth phase. The 'N' for mu_hat is set to 3 to focus on the current peak demand of ~3000 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand growth continues to accelerate, with P29-P31 average demand reaching 2,973 units (+18% vs P25-P27). Lead time volatility persists, necessitating L=3 for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience aggressive demand growth. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) show demand of 2866, 3137, and 2897, with a mean of approximately 2966 units (+19% compared to the 2400-range seen around P26). Lead time remains highly erratic, historically fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant periods of stockouts due to delayed arrivals. Though the promised lead time is 2, the conservative planning horizon for calculating base stock must remain at L=3 to account for the risk of 3-period delays and the 1-period observation lag. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures the most recent demand level (~2800-3100) and its heightened volatility. The OR engine will target a high service level (0.80) based on the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1), which is appropriate given the current regime of extreme growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand growth acceleration continues, with average demand over P30-P32 reaching 2,967 units (+15% vs P26-P28). High stockout frequency necessitates planning with L=3.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with the latest observation reaching 3,332 units in Period 33. The average demand over the last three periods (P31-P33) is approximately 3,122 units, representing a sustained increase compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P32 arrived in 1 period, but many previous orders took 3). To protect against chronic stockouts and the unpredictability of arrivals, I am maintaining the effective planning lead time at L=3. The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand with significant in-transit volume, but past stockouts indicate that the pipeline is often insufficient to meet the trailing demand spikes. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand level of ~3,122 units per period (projected over 1+L periods), and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand growth continues to accelerate, with P31-P33 average demand reaching 3,122 units (+5% vs P29-P31). L=3 remains the critical planning horizon due to continued arrival volatility and frequent stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the P32-P34 average demand reaching 3,147 units, representing a sustained growth trend. We are currently facing chronic stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time remains highly volatile, with recent arrivals occurring at 1-period (P32 order) and 2-period intervals, though a 3-period lead time has frequently occurred in the past (e.g., P20, P23). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the total demand during the risk period (Review + Lead Time), I am setting L=3 to provide a safety buffer against this volatility. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand spike (averaging approx 3,100 per period), which results in a mu_hat of (1+3)*3147 \u2248 12588. This ensures the base stock level is high enough to cover the aggressive growth and minimize the frequency of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand growth continues to accelerate, with P32-P34 average demand reaching 3,147 units (+6% vs P31-P33). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods; L=3 remains the essential planning horizon to address chronic stockouts.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with the average demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) reaching approximately 3,345 units. This represents a 15% increase over the P30-P32 average. Significant stockouts persist as on-hand inventory remains at zero. Lead time is highly erratic, historically fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent orders like P32 arriving in 1 period while others remain in-transit. Given the high demand and stockout risk, a planning lead time of L=3 is necessary to calculate a sufficiently high base stock. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P31-P35) to capture the most recent demand level of ~3,133 units/period, projected over a 4-period window (1+L=4). sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the current high volatility in demand. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level that reflects the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio while buffering against both demand spikes and lead-time delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand growth remains aggressive; P33-P35 average demand reached 3,345 units (+15% vs P30-P32). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; L=3 remains the mandatory planning horizon to address chronic stockouts.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with the P34-P36 average reaching 3,483.6 units, representating an approximately 10% increase over the P31-P33 average. Lead times remain highly erratic, with the most recent arrival (P34 order) taking 2 periods, following a sequence of 1, 2, and 3-period arrivals. Given the frequent stockouts and aggressive growth, maintaining a planning lead time of L=3 is essential to provide enough buffer for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand spike (3,483.6 units/period), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure volatility from the last 5 periods of aggressive growth is captured, supporting a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand growth accelerated further; P34-P36 average demand is 3,484 units (+11% vs P31-P33). Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods, necessitating L=3 for safety stock to address persistent stockouts.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively, with Period 37 reaching a high of 3643 units. The 3-period average (P35-P37) is approximately 3627 units, which is chosen for mu_hat Calculation. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits the 3-period horizon (e.g., historical and sustained lags). Given the persistent stockouts and extreme demand growth, I am maintaining L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set using 'explicit' at (1+L)*3627 = 14508. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase. This strategy aims to build a significant pipeline to counter the currently depleted on-hand inventory and the frequent 100% stockout periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand growth continues its steep trajectory, with P35-P37 average demand at 3627 units (+14% vs P32-P34). Planning remain centered on L=3 to mitigate the impact of volatile lead times and frequent stockouts.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively. The average demand over the last three periods (P36-P38) is approximately 3587 units, which is a significant increase from earlier periods. Given this sustained upward trajectory, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this most recent surge while remaining responsive to the trend. Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P36 order) taking 1 period and the one before (P35) taking 2. However, historical volatility and frequent stockouts (e.g., Period 38 ending inventory of 0) justify maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure sufficient inventory is ordered to cover the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to provide a localized estimate of volatility during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues climb: P36-P38 average demand is ~3587 units, a 15% increase over the P31-P33 average. Stockouts persist due to demand outstripping supply arrivals.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, with Period 39 demand reaching 3,792. The average demand over the last three periods (P37-P39) is approximately 3,602 units, representing a sustained upward trend. Lead times remain highly erratic, with the most recent arrival (P38 order) taking 1 period, while previous orders have taken up to 3 periods. To mitigate persistent stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting L to 3 periods as the safety planning horizon. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most current demand level (~3,600 units/period), resulting in a forecast of 14,408 for the (1+L) window. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed in the latest demand regime. These settings aim to force the OR backend to increase the base stock level and clear more of the massive in-transit pipeline into on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P37-P39 average demand reached 3,602 units (+13% vs P34-P36). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for risk mitigation.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with Period 40 demand reaching a new high of 4106 units. The 3-period moving average (P38-P40) is approximately 3756 units, reflecting approximately 4% growth over the previous period's average. Stockouts remain a chronic issue as on-hand inventory is depleted immediately upon arrival. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 38 arrived in 1, Period 37 is still pending at 3 periods, and Period 40 has not yet arrived). To safeguard against this volatility and the steep demand climb, I am maintaining the planning lead time at L=3. For mu_hat, I am using an explicit forecast of 15200, which represents (1+L) * 3800, to account for the current demand level and the high probability of continued growth within the 4-period planning window (current period + L). Sigma_hat is set to 800 (explicit) to provide a robust safety buffer against both procurement delays and demand spikes, which have been frequent.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand growth sustained with Period 40 demand reaching 4106 units (+14% vs P37-P39 avg). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), with recent observations confirming L=3 as the necessary planning horizon to handle supply arrival uncertainty.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb aggressively, with the most recent observed demand at 4,110 units. The average demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) is 4,003 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P34, P35, P36 took 1-2 periods while P38 took 1 period, but historical volatility frequently hits 3 periods). To prevent the ongoing chronic stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting L=3 as the planning horizon. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level (~4,000 units/period), resulting in a forecast of (1+3)*4003 = 16,012 for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set using N=10 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high variance and consistent stockouts seen in the recent history.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand growth has reached a new level, with P39-P41 average at 4,003 units (+11% vs P37-P39 avg). Chronic stockouts persist as on-hand remains 0, confirming that planning must account for a lead time of 3 periods to ensure safety stock covers arrival gaps.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate steeply. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P40-P42) is 4,212 units, representing a 5% increase over the previous 3-period block (P39-P41: 4,003 units) and significantly exceeding earlier forecasts. Leading into Period 43, on-hand inventory remains 0, and we have 16,663 units in various stages of transit (including a large unfulfilled pipeline from previous high-volume order periods). Although lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, L=3 remains the only safe planning horizon given the systemic arrival delays observed throughout the history. To address chronic stockouts and the persistent upward trend, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current 4,200+ demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility associated with this higher demand regime. Given the backend logic (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) and the 16k+ units already in transit, the OR engine will determine the final order based on the gap between this projected required inventory and the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand growth continues to accelerate, with P40-P42 average demand reaching 4,212 units (+5% vs P39-P41). Chronic stockouts persist with on-hand at 0; L=3 remains the mandatory planning lead time to account for arrival volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect an aggressive upward trend, with the P41-P43 average demand reaching approximately 4,192 units. Despite this trend, chronic stockouts persist\u2014on-hand inventory is effectively zero because arrivals are significantly smaller than current demand levels. The pipeline is currently large (15,960 units) due to massive orders placed in earlier periods to chase the demand spike. Lead time remains erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; the recent P40 order arrived in 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend's service level logic accounts for the full risk cycle, I am maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand elevation (average ~4,192 per period), which results in a mu_hat covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility observed in this high-demand regime. This configuration encourages the OR engine to maintain a high base stock to bridge the gap between volatile arrivals and climbing demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand growth remains extremely high with P41-P43 average at 4,192 units (+16% vs P38-P40). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), reaffirming L=3 as the necessary planning horizon to handle chronic stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4424.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect an aggressive upward trend. Period 44 saw a demand of 4,388, with the latest 3-period average (P42-P44) reaching approximately 4,285 units. Chronic stockouts have persisted as on-hand inventory repeatedly hits zero, indicating that the supply chain is struggling to keep pace with the demand ramp. The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; most recently, orders from P40 and P41 both arrived with a 3-period lead time. Given this volatility and the critical need to rebuild inventory to prevent lost sales, I am maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon. For mu_hat, I am using a 'recent_N' of 3 to capture the most current demand level (avg ~4,285), which results in a mu_hat of 17,140 (4 periods * 4,285). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' of 3 to capture current volatility. These parameters aim to raise the base stock level significantly to finally generate a positive ending inventory balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P42-P44 average demand is ~4,285 units (+2% vs P41-P43). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the two most recent arrivals (P40, P41), confirming L=3 as the necessary planning horizon to mitigate chronic stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3156.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate steeply. The most recent three-period average (P43-P45) is 4,280 units, compared to the P40-P42 average of 4,212. Demand has effectively tripled since the mid-teens and continues to climb, leading to a state of chronic stockouts where ending on-hand inventory has been zero for nearly every period. Lead time remains unstable but has hit 3 periods for the three most recent arrivals (P40, P41, P42). I am maintaining L=3 as the planning lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current peak demand level (~4280 units per period). Given L=3, the backend will calculate base stock for (1+L)=4 periods of demand, targeting approximately 17,120 units. With in-transit at 16,701, this should trigger meaningful replacement orders to finally bridge the stockout gap and capture the high profits available.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P43-P45 average demand is 4,280 units (+10% vs P38-P40). Lead time has showed a run of 3-period arrivals (P40, P41, P42), reinforcing L=3 as the required planning horizon to address the chronic stockout regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: Demand for chips(Regular) continues at an extreme level, with a recent 3-period average (P44-P46) of 4,420 units. Chronic stockouts persist, as evidenced by an ending inventory of 0 in the last period. Lead time remains erratic but suggests a recurring 3-period horizon for most major arrivals (P40, P41, P42 all arrived with L=3). Therefore, I am maintaining L=3 as the planning horizon to ensure the base stock calculation covers demand through the lead time plus the review period (L+1). Given the sustained demand growth and high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 implies a target service level of 80%), I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility (~4,420 mean). This setting helps the OR backend aggressively order to fill the massive pipeline gap (In-transit: 17723) while aiming to return the system to on-hand availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P44-P46 average demand is 4,420 units (+3% vs P42-P44 average). Lead time has demonstrated a consistent run of 3-period arrivals for the most recent tracking sequence (P40, P41, P42).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, with the average demand for the most recent periods (P45-P47) reaching 4,447 units, a slight increase from the previous average. Chronic stockouts persist, with on-hand inventory remaining at 0 as arrivals fail to keep pace with demand. Lead time remains erratic but has shown a consistent trend of 3 periods for several recent successful arrivals (P40, P41, P42). To provide a sufficient inventory buffer and address the service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I am setting L=3 to account for the longest typical lead time observed recently. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~4447 units). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility inherent in this aggressive growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P45-P47 average demand is 4,447 units (+1% vs P44-P46). Lead time continues to exhibit a 3-period reliability for several recent orders (P40, P41, P42), reinforcing L=3 as the necessary planning horizon.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience an extreme and persistent demand growth regime, with the most recent demand in Period 48 reaching 4,822 units. The three-period average (P46-P48) is 4,585 units, representing a sustained increase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have significant in-transit quantities. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods (as seen in arrivals for P40, P41, and P42), making L=3 the necessary planning horizon to ensure the OR backend accounts for enough safety stock. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current demand level of ~4,585 per period, totaling 18,340 for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the volatility observed in the recent high-demand periods to ensure a high service level given the high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand growth remains extreme with the P46-P48 average demand reaching 4,585 units (+4% vs P44-P46). Lead time continues to be treated as 3 periods for planning purposes due to recurrent arrival delays and chronic stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 49 demand hitting a new high of 5,048 units. The average demand for the most recent period block (P47-P49) is approximately 4,779 units, continuing the aggressive growth trend. Inventory remains a critical issue as we are in a persistent stockout state (on-hand is 0). Lead time volatility remains a key risk; while some orders arrive in 1-2 periods, the most recent documented sequence of arrivals (P40, P41, P42 arriving in P43, P44, P45 respectively) confirms a 3-period lead time. To prevent chronic stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculations cover the necessary horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current peak demand level (~4,779/period), and sigma_hat is also calculated over recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased variance associated with these higher volumes. This aggressive posture aims to build inventory levels sufficient to meet incoming demand despite arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand growth continues to accelerate with Period 49 reaching 5,048 units; P47-P49 average demand is 4,779 units (+11% vs P44-P46 average). Lead time remains erratic but planning continues at L=3 to account for periodic 3-period delays and persistent stockouts.
