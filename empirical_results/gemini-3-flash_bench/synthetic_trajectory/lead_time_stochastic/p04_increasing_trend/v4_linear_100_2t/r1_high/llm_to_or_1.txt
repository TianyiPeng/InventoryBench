Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. There is no historical information on arrivals yet. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127. The average demand across these 5 samples is 92.4, and the standard deviation is 62.3. Since we are at the start and have a high-demand outlier (170 in Period 4) and a zero-demand outlier (Period 3), I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to process all available historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a baseline base-stock calculation (1+L)*mean_demand plus a safety stock cushion. Following the decision checklist: (1) Date is Period 1, chips category. (2) No inventory, no pipeline yet. (3) Using default methods to capture all 5 historical samples provided.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 197 units (likely targeted a 1+2 lead time base stock), but since the promised lead time is 2, those units have not arrived yet. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 197 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 79, which resulted in 79 lost sales due to zero inventory. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) average ~92.4, but the most recent samples (excluding the outlier 0) suggest higher levels. Given the 197 in-transit and the 0 on-hand, the OR backend needs parameters to determine if more should be ordered. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent historical distribution (avg 92.4, std 63.6), and default for Lead Time (2 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (this period). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. However, we have an immediate stockout issue: on-hand is 0, and we have missed demand in P1 (79) and P2 (114) because no inventory was available at the start. Total demand samples are: P1=75, P2=90, P3=0 (placeholder/not occurred yet), P4=170, P5=127 (from provided data). Re-evaluating the historical demand provided in the prompt: P1=75, P2=90, P3=0 (likely a data error or zero demand), P4=170, P5=127. Average demand (excluding the 0 in P3) is ~115. Since we have a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical path is ensuring we cover the lead time (L=2) and the current review period (total L+1=3). Pipeline inventory is 395 units (Orders from P1 and P2). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the climbing demand (75 to 90) and ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently to build a safety stock after the initial stockout.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (197 units) were expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and our current on-hand inventory is 0. This indicates a shipment delay or a longer actual lead time than promised. Demand has been steadily increasing: P1: 79 (reported as 75 in samples, but history says 79), P2: 114, P3: 164. The mean demand of the first three periods is approximately 119. Given the missing arrivals, we have a total pipeline of 440 units (197 + 198 + 45). Since we have 0 on-hand and 100% stockout so far, I will use an explicit forecast for demand and provide a conservative lead time estimate. I'll set L=3 based on the fact that the P1 order (L=2) has not arrived yet. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value of 480 (120 mean demand * (1+3 periods)) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand trend and the observed delivery delay.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 155 units on-hand and 379 units in-transit. Historical demand (P1-P5) is [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with an average of 92.4 units per period. The inventory was empty until P4 due to lead time. We have observed two completed deliveries: P1 arrived in P4 (LT=3) and P3 arrived in P4 (LT=1). The P2 order (198 units) is still in-transit and is currently at LT=3 relative to when it was placed. This indicates significant lead-time variance (mean LT=2, but range 1-3). Given the high demand in recent periods (P4 and P5), I'm using recent_N for demand forecasting (N=4 to capture the nonzero periods) to avoid being skewed by the P3 zero. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed values (1 and 3), recognizing the promised 2 is a baseline but actuals fluctuate.mu_hat will be based on recent performance to ensure we don't stock out if the P2 order remains delayed.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the chips(Regular) SKU. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [79, 114, 164, 87, 122], with an average of approximately 113.2 units. The 'Period 4 conclude' message shows two arrivals: one from Period 1 with a lead time of 3 periods, and one from Period 3 with a lead time of 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. This suggests variability in actual delivery times (1 to 3 periods). As of Period 6, we have 33 units on-hand and 416 units in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, and 5). Note that the Period 2 order (198 units) is now at L=4 and has not yet arrived, which is a concern. To handle the lead time uncertainty, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the recent samples don't show a clear regime shift yet, but 164 was a peak; I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the observed demand volatility (std dev \u2248 34.5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical observations show variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (L=1). The order from Period 2 (198 units) is currently missing/overdue\u2014it should have arrived in Period 4 or 5 based on observed lead times. Total in-transit is 531, which covers orders from Period 2, 4, 5, and 6. Demand has averaged 115.5 units over the last 6 periods (79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127). Given the stockout in Period 6 and the missing Period 2 shipment, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the likely lead time variation. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the jitter (avg 2.0 based on concludes so far), 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the full history of demand (averaging ~115), and 'default' for sigma_hat to manage the volatility (std devs: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) mandates a high service level.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 102 units on-hand and 436 in-transit. Historical lead times show variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4), and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods (P7). The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to account for this variability. Demand samples (P1-P7) are 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79. The mean demand is approximately 110.3. There is no clear trending regime shift yet, so 'default' for mu_hat (which uses the mean of all samples) is appropriate. Sigma_hat is also set to 'default' to capture historical volatility. The total in-transit (436) includes orders from P2 (198), P5 (37), P6 (115), and P7 (86). If P2 (ordered at P2) hasn't arrived by P7, it is now at L=5, suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed, but we must maintain the base stock logic to cover future periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1975.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high variability. While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have been: P1 orders (L=3), P3 orders (L=1), P4 orders (L=3), P5 orders (L=3), and P7 orders (L=1). The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Historically, there are two distinct lead time outcomes (1 or 3). Because the last order to arrive (from P7) had a lead time of 1, but the order from P2 is significantly late (likely lost or severely delayed as it's been 7 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average drift. Demand has been fluctuating between 79 and 164. The mean of all historical samples (8) is 111.5. Given the high variance and the recent loss/delay of the P2 order (198 units), it is critical to maintain a higher base stock to cover the current in-transit uncertainty. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~105) while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.2). Order from Period 2 (198 units) is significantly overdue (>promised 2 periods) and potentially lost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order from Period 2 (198 units) is now 8 periods overdue, strongly suggesting it is lost. Historical lead times follow a 'flip-flop' pattern of 3 periods or 1 period (average 2.0). Since the last arrival (Period 8 order) had a lead time of 1, I expect the next arrivals (Period 6 and Period 9 orders) to likely arrive in Period 10 or 11. Demand is relatively stable, with a recent mean around 101 units (last 5 samples: 122, 127, 79, 110, 84). I will set L to 2 (promised/average) but use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the lost inventory logic. The OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation includes 'In-transit' units; however, 198 of the 351 units in-transit are likely lost. To compensate for the 'phantom' supply the OR engine thinks we have, I will provide an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand plus the lost 198 units to force a corrective order.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment from Period 2 (198 units) confirmed lost (8 periods overdue). Pipeline inventory 'In-transit' count is inflated by these lost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1045.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 107 units per period (excluding the start-up phase in the first few periods where sales were zero due to stockouts). In the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand values are [127, 79, 110, 84, 104], averaging 100.8. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: {P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1}. The average observed lead time is 2.0. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (198 units) is confirmed lost as of Period 10 (8 periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' figure is 509 units, but this includes the 198 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is (509 - 198) = 311 units. Since the OR backend cannot 'forget' the 198 units, it will see a pipeline of 509 and under-order. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' methods to set a higher base stock. Given L=2, demand covers 3 periods (L+1). Target inventory = 3 * 105 = 315 units. To offset the 198 lost units the OR engine thinks we have, I must set mu_hat to approximately (315 + 198) = 513 units. Sigma_hat is set based on the spread of recent demand to maintain service levels.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high uncertainty due to volatile lead times and confirmed lost shipments. The Period 2 order (198 units) is officially lost, inflating the 'In-transit' count (576 units) seen by the OR backend. To prevent the backend from under-ordering because it thinks these units are coming, I must increase mu_hat using 'explicit' to offset this 'phantom' inventory. Lead times have oscillated between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.14). Demand has been relatively stable around 100-110 units per period. Current on-hand is 0, and units from Periods 9 (38 units), 10 (158 units), and 11 (67 units) are in the pipeline. I'm setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound) to ensure the safety stock covers the longest likely delay. I'm setting mu_hat to a value that covers (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 198 lost units to trick the backend into ordering the replenishment we actually need.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 198 permanently lost units from Period 2; all parameter adjustments must account for this fixed offset until the units are no longer 'In-transit'. Average lead time is 2.14, but volatility between 1-3 periods is the current norm.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 101. The 'In-transit' quantity of 474 units is significantly inflated by 198 units from Period 2, which are confirmed lost. This leaves a functional pipeline of 276 units (474 - 198). The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with the most recent sample at 95 and a mean around 108. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with the average calculation currently at approximately 2.14. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (including the 198 lost units) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. Base stock calculation: Target = (\u03bc * (L+1)). With L=2.14, L+1 = 3.14. Using \u03bc=108, target is ~339. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 198-unit 'ghost' inventory, I adjust mu_hat to (339 + 198) = 537. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the varying lead times and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current volatility while ignoring the early outlier zeros.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we have On-hand inventory of 26 units and In-transit inventory of 517 units. As documented in Carry-over Insights, the In-transit figure includes 198 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective In-transit inventory is 319 units (517 - 198). The demand remains relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend detected in 'chips(Regular)'. Since Period 4, demand has fluctuated between 75 and 127 units, with a mean around 102. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.15 periods. To account for the 'lost' units inflating the pipeline, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. This allows the OR engine to subtract the full pipeline (including the phantom 198 units) while I supply a target base stock that has been inflated by 198 units to compensate. Calculation: Expected demand over (L+1) periods = (2.15 + 1) * 102 \u2248 321. Adding the 198-unit offset gives an explicit mu_hat of ~519. We set L=2 as the baseline lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 14 periods with a mean of ~98 units. However, we face two critical supply issues: (1) Lead time volatility (observed lead times: 1, 2, and 3 periods), and (2) A confirmed lost shipment of 198 units from Period 2. The Current 'In-transit' figure of 534 units includes this un-arrived block (534 - 198 = 336 real units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock calculation: \u03bc_daily \u2248 100. Expected L+1 = 3 periods. Target inventory = 300 + safety stock. With 47 on-hand and 336 real pipeline units (total 383), no immediate large order is needed, but to account for the lost stock offset in the OR's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic, I will provide an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand plus an offset for the lost units to ensure continuous replenishment. mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean + Lost_Units \u2248 (3 * 100) + 198 = 498. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent demand (~35 units) scaled across the lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 6 units on hand. The 'In-transit' quantity is 440, but this includes 198 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost. Thus, effectively, we have 242 units (440 - 198) in the functional pipeline. Demand has been relatively stable with a recent mean of approximately 100 units. To set parameters for the OR backend: 1) Lead Time (L): While the promised lead time is 2, the observed reality is a mix of 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). I will set 'L' to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced across all arrived shipments. 2) Mu_hat: I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime of approximately 95-100 units per period, which ensures the base stock calculation reflects current throughput. 3) Sigma_hat: I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent volatility. This conservative approach accounts for the lost units (which decrease actual pipeline inventory) while maintaining enough buffer for the 1-3 period lead time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown higher volatility recently, with Period 16 hitting 183 units. The pipeline inventory (397 units) is heavily distorted by the lost order of 198 units from Period 2; the functional pipeline is actually 199 units (84 ordered in P14, 0 in P15, 0 in P16). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), making 'calculate' the most reliable method for L. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the mean demand of approximately 104 units without being overly skewed by the early startup phase or the most recent outlier. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=10 is used to reflect the current high volatility (Std Dev ~40), ensuring the OR engine sets a higher base stock to prevent the stockouts observed in periods 10, 11, and 16. The parameters are designed to generate an order that covers the 0 on-hand status and anticipates the 2-3 period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1596.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout occurred in Period 17 (only 84 of 212 units sold). Demand has surged significantly in recent periods (P15: 135, P16: 183, P17: 212), moving away from the earlier average of ~100. Lead times have mostly stabilized at 3 periods (P11, P12, P13, and P14 orders all arrived after 3 periods). The pipeline 'In-transit' of 416 units includes 198 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost (remaining there indefinitely). To account for this, the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) needs to see a inflated base stock or we must assume L=3 and a higher demand. I am setting L to explicit 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the volatility. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a higher buffer due to the recent stockouts and demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand has increased from an average of ~100 to ~175 over the last 3 periods (P15-P17). Actual lead time is now consistently 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift first detected in Period 18. Historical demand has surged from ~100 to an average of ~205 over the last three periods (P16: 183, P17: 212, P18: 220). Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for recent arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14 all took 3 periods). The 'In-transit' count of 628 is heavily misleading because it includes 198 units from Period 2 that are officially lost. I will set the lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect the current physical reality. To capture the recent demand surge, I will use a 4-sample average (including Period 15: 135 to slightly smooth the recent jump) which yields a mean of ~187.5. By setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) with L=3, the OR backend targets a base stock of (1+3)*187.5 = 750. Since the backend's effective pipeline calculation will be (In-transit - lost units) = (628 - 198) = 430, the resulting order should aggressively replenish the depletion. A higher sigma_hat is used to buffer against this high-revenue/high-volatility phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P16-P18 demand averaged 205, a 100% increase over the P1-P14 average. Lead time is currently stable at 3 periods (observed P11-P14).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Over the last 4 periods (P16-P19), demand averaged 195.25 units, compared to the early-game average of ~100. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is experiencing stockouts. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed in the last 6 arrivals). Although the promised lead time is 2, I will set L to 3 explicitly to reflect reality. Pipeline inventory 'In-transit' is 877, but this includes 198 units from Period 2 which are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 679 units. To compensate for the demand surge and the lost units, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatile state. Using L=3 with N=4 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next 4 periods (L+1) of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-19 average demand is 195.25, a ~95% increase from baseline. Realized lead time remains stable at 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Situation: Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 877 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights (Period 10, 12), 198 units from Period 2 are permanently lost. Effective in-transit is therefore 679 units (877 - 198).

Demand: A structural regime shift occurred around Period 16. Demand for P16-P20 averaged 186.2 units, nearly double the previous historical average. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime.

Lead Time: The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times for the last 4 concluded shipments have consistently been 3 periods (P11, P12, P13, P14 orders all took 3 periods). I will set L to 3 explicitly to reflect this reality.

Parameters: By setting L=3 and using recent_N (N=5) for demand and volatility, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the new, higher rate (~186/period). The lost 198 units in the pipeline are a significant problem because the backend subtracts 'Pipeline Inventory' from 'Base Stock'. Since I cannot subtract the 198 from the pipe directly, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' inventory. 
Adjustment Calculation: Target mu_hat = (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 186 = 744. To negate the 198 lost units in the pipeline subtraction, mu_hat_explicit = 744 + 198 = 942.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (Periods 16-21) with an average demand of approximately 172 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. Lead times have also shifted from a promised 2 periods to a more consistent 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals). Crucially, there is a shipment of 198 units from Period 2 that is permanently lost but still included in the OR backend's 'In-transit' calculation. Additionally, a large order of 103 units from Period 17 and 212 units from Period 18 are now due/overdue based on L=3, resulting in current stockouts (on-hand = 0). To compensate for the lost 198 units (which prevent the backend from ordering enough) and the increased demand+lead time, I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Expected (L+1) demand = 4 * 172 = 688. To 'offset' the 198 phantom units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 688 + 198 = 886. This ensures the base stock level is high enough to trigger the necessary ordering despite the pipeline inflation. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect the higher volatility of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Lead time remains at 3 periods for recent successful arrivals. Ongoing stockouts due to recent demand spike and pipeline inflation from the 198 lost units from P2.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state due to a sustained demand regime shift (elevated mean demand since Period 16) and a consistent 3-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 1040, but this includes a 198-unit permanently lost order from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 842 units. Recent demand (P16-P22) averages approximately 170 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (L=3), base stock must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I am setting L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and mu_hat to 680 (170 * 4) using recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 40 * sqrt(4)) using recent_N to reflect current volatility. These parameters will force the OR engine to place orders that compensate for the lost units and regularize inventory levels against the increased demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1437.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 152 over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), following a significant regime shift that peaked around P18. The current demand is lower than the initial spike but remains significantly higher than the baseline before Period 15. The observed lead time is currently 2-3 periods (most recently 2 periods for the P21 order). A critical factor is the 'In-transit' figure of 877, which includes 198 permanently lost units from Period 2. The adjusted pipeline is 679. I am setting L=3 to be conservative given historical volatility. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=8 to capture the post-spike demand levels (P16-P23), as the system needs to maintain a consistent stock level relative to the new mean. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to account for the heightened volatility observed since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a new mean of ~152 (observed P16-P23) following the P15-P18 spike. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 198 lost units from P2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant spike in Period 24 (271 units), although the carry-over insight suggests a stabilization around 152. Given the stockout in P24 (ending on-hand: 0) and the high demand volatility (ranging from 80 to 271 in the last 4 periods), I need to set parameters that ensure a higher base stock. The current in-transit inventory is 877, but 198 units from P2 are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 679. Most recent successful arrivals (P23) showed a lead time of 2 periods, while the long-term observation has been 3. I will set L=3 to be conservative and protect against stockouts during this volatile period. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~171 per period) which results in a mu_hat of approx 685 (4 * 171.4). For sigma_hat, I will use explicit valuation of 120 based on the recent high standard deviation to ensure a robust safety stock, especially given the Profit/Holding ratio of 19:1 which justifies a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: Period 24 demand (271) is a 78% increase over the recent 'stable' mean of 152. Lead time remains variable between 2-3 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a critical inventory shortage with Period 26 starting at 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 2 order (198 units) remains lost after 24 periods, inflating the 'In-transit' count to 882. Real in-transit units are 684 (882 - 198). Demand has been extremely volatile: after stabilizing near 150, the last two periods saw spikes (271 and 182). I will set L=3 as the most recent stable lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I am choosing 213.25 (1066.25 total for L=3) based on an explicit forecast: the average of the last two volatile periods (226.5) slightly moderated by the previous regime to account for the ongoing spike. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 60 to buffer against this high volatility. The OR backend needs higher base stock parameters to trigger ordering despite the phantom 'In-transit' units and to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted from a stable mean of 152 to a high-variance state with recent peaks (>270), requiring higher safety stock. Lead time remains clustered at 3 periods for the most recent arrivals.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1051 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' figure remains inflated by 198 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost. The adjusted pipeline is therefore 853 units. We are currently recovering from multiple stockouts. Demand has shown extreme volatility recently (P16-P19: ~195; P20-P23: ~122; P24: 271; P25: 182; P26: 60). Given this 'saw-tooth' demand pattern, calculating mu_hat over the last 11 periods (P16-P26) captures the high-demand regime while smoothing the recent drop, resulting in an average of approx 151 per period. Since lead time has consistently clustered at 3 periods for recent successful arrivals (P11-P17 orders all took 3 periods, except P21 which took 2), I set L=3. To protect against the high volatility seen in P24-P25, sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' for the same 11-period window to ensure sufficient safety stock. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 4 periods of demand required to cover the lead time + current period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a zero on-hand inventory state with ongoing stockouts despite high demand. Period 27 demand was 239, suggesting the demand regime remains highly volatile with a high mean. Historical evaluation confirms that the shipment of 198 units from Period 2 is lost; therefore, the current 'In-transit' of 1051 units must be adjusted to an effective pipeline of 853 (1051 - 198). Recent demand (P24-P27) shows values of 271, 182, 60, and 239, averaging 188. This is consistent with the high-demand regime identified earlier. Lead time has been fluctuating mainly between 2 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure safety against longer arrivals and stockouts. I'm using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-variance state while accounting for the lead time L=3 (requiring coverage for L+1 = 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-variance regime: average demand over P24-P27 is 188 with significant peaks (>230). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 198 lost units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a high-variance regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 195.4, significantly higher than the initial baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is 882 units. However, as noted in previous periods, 198 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 684 units. Recent arrivals (P23, P28) show lead times of 2 periods, though a 3-period lead time has been frequent. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lost units, I will set L to 3 (conservative) and use a recent_N window for demand (N=5) to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock to cover the roughly 4 periods of demand (L+1) required.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, with the most recent sample at Period 29 (69) being a sharp drop from Period 28 (225). Over the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged approximately 174. Pipeline inventory is currently 1052 units, but this remains inflated by 198 units lost from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 854 units. Observed lead times for the most recent arrivals (P23, P28) were 2 periods, though a 3-period lead time remains common in history. I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the history of stockouts. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (N=6, P24-P29) to capture the current high-variance regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to ensure the safety stock captures this recent volatility, which helps the OR backend maintain a higher service level during peaks.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand environment remains highly volatile but historically elevated compared to the early periods. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), average demand is approximately 157 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 66. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 1052 units. Crucially, 198 units from a Period 2 order are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is 854 units. Realized lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods recently. I will use recent_N (N=15) to capture this new regime's mean and volatility while setting L to 3 to account for the consistently seen maximum lead time, ensuring buffer for arrival delays. Setting L=3 and using recent data for mu and sigma allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated and variable demand currently being observed.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P24-P31) shows high volatility with a mean of ~178, characterized by sharp peaks (up to 271). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is experiencing frequent stockouts. The In-transit inventory of 1052 units is heavily inflated by the 198 permanently lost units from Period 2, which have been 'in-transit' for 30 periods. To account for this, the effective pipeline is ~854 units. Recent successful deliveries (P23, P28) show a realized lead time of 2 periods, even though previous history suggested 3. I will set L to 3 to remain conservative given the high variance and stockout history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the higher mean of the current volatile regime (~178 per period) and explicit sigma_hat to provide a safety buffer against the observed demand peaks of >230 units, ensuring the service level q (0.95) is adequately supported.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P24-P32) continues to show high volatility with an average of approximately 166 units, while realized lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods. We have 1052 units in-transit according to the snapshot, but 198 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2), leaving an effective pipeline of 854 units. Despite this high in-transit number, we have experienced several periods of stockouts (Ending OH = 0 since P29), suggesting the backend is under-ordering due to the inflated pipeline and demand variance. To address this, I will set L to 3 (the upper end of the observed lead time cluster) and use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the high-variance mean (~166) over the (L+1) period. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the recent high volatility (StDev ~75-80). Setting mu_hat to 664 (166 * 4) and sigma_hat to 160 (covering volatility over the lead time) will force a higher base stock to compensate for the lost units and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed extreme demand volatility (StDev ~78) persists from P24-P32. Effective pipeline inventory remains 'In-transit' minus 198 lost units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, several critical factors must be addressed. First, the 'In-transit' inventory of 1052 units includes 198 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 854 units. Second, demand has entered an extremely high-volatility phase; the demand in Period 33 was 399, which is a record high and nearly double the recent 188 average. Over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), mean demand is approximately 190 with a standard deviation of 103, indicating a need for a much higher mu_hat and sigma_hat. Third, lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the stockout state. To account for the 198-unit 'In-transit' phantom inventory, I will adjust mu_hat using the explicit method. The calculation for mu_hat is: (1+L)*Mean_Demand + 198 = (1+3)*190 + 198 = 760 + 198 = 958. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that compensates for the lost units it thinks are still coming. I will also set sigma_hat explicitly to 206 (sqrt(1+3)*std_of_103) to manage the intense volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has reached extreme levels as of Period 33 (single-period demand peak of 399). Effective pipeline remains total In-transit minus 198 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-variance demand regime that began around Period 24. Average demand since P24 is approximately 183.8 units per period, but with extreme volatility (max 399, min 60). The pipeline inventory currently stands at 1297 units, but this includes 198 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders, I must use an 'explicit' L value of 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for both the higher mean and the extreme variance observed recently. I will set mu_hat based on the (1+L) * recent mean (~184 * 4 = 736) and sigma_hat explicitly high to provide a safety buffer against the type of spike seen in Period 33 (399 units). Setting sigma_hat to 350 reflects the high standard error of demand in this period and ensures responsive replenishment despite the 'lost unit' noise in the pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extreme peak phase, with Period 35 demand reaching 688 units, more than double the previous peak. This follows a period of high volatility (Period 33 demand was 399). Given the date is Period 36 (late in the sequence), this likely represents a major seasonal or promotional spike. I must aggressively increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent further stockouts, as on-hand inventory is zero and recent service levels have been poor. I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the consistently observed longer lead times (versus the promised 2). For mu_hat, I am setting an explicit value of 1400 (350 units/period * (L+1)) and a high sigma_hat of 500 to provide a significant buffer for this unprecedented demand regime. I continue to account for the 198 units lost from Period 2 which still inflate the 'In-transit' figure; however, the massive demand increase now outweighs that accounting offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Extreme seasonal demand spike confirmed. Period 35 demand (688) and Period 33 (399) indicate a new high-magnitude demand regime significantly exceeding previous volatility levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3415.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in an extreme seasonal demand regime. Period 35 demand was 688, and over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), mean demand is approximately 234 with very high variance (approx. 185). The current Lead Time (L) has stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in the Period 34 order arriving in Period 36). Crucially, the 'In-transit' pipeline is still inflated by 198 units from a lost shipment in Period 2. To ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to cover the seasonal peak without being throttled by the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to reflect the recent high-magnitude demand (mean ~315 over the last 5 periods) and extreme volatility. This ensures a high service level during this critical Period 37-40 window.

Carry-over insight: Extreme seasonal demand confirmed: P35 demand (688) follows a P33 peak (399), indicating a high-magnitude regime where mean demand is ~240 and standard deviation is ~180 (P27-P36). Actual lead time has returned to 2 periods as of P36. Pipeline inventory continues to be inflated by 198 lost units from P2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-839.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 38 of 50. Demand analysis shows an extreme seasonal spike around Period 35 (688 units) followed by a sharp drop to 0 in Period 37. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the mean demand is ~198. However, given the zero demand in P37, we must avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation. On-hand inventory is currently high (839 units) following the arrival of 762 units ordered in P36 (1-period lead time). The recorded 'In-transit' of 1052 units includes the 198 permanently lost units from Period 2 and several orders from P17-P19 that likely are lost or significantly delayed. Lead time has recently been 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised). Demand mu_hat is set to a recent 10-period average to capture the volatility while recognizing the spike has likely passed. Sigma_hat is set high to account for recent extreme variance (688 peak). The high on-hand inventory should cover demand while the OR backend caps new orders to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains highly volatile with extreme spikes (P35: 688) followed by sudden drops (P37: 0). Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently characterized by high seasonality and extreme volatility, with a recent peak of 688 (P35) followed by zero demand (P37) and a rebound to 192 (P38). Over the last 15 periods (P24-P38), the mean demand is approximately 190 with a standard deviation of approximately 170. Currently, on-hand inventory is 647. Pipeline inventory is visible as 1052 units, but 198 of these units are from the lost Period 2 shipment, making the effective pipeline 854 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 1501. Lead times have recently stabilized at 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 to cover the promised timeframe, mu_hat to an explicit value of 600 (3 periods * 200 avg demand) to maintain a buffer for the observed high-magnitude spikes, and sigma_hat to 300 to reflect the intense variance and prevent stockouts during the next seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime remains in high-volatility seasonal state (P24-P38 mean ~190, SD ~170). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 198 lost units (P2).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is in a high-volatility seasonal state, characterized by extreme peaks (e.g., P35: 688) and subsequent drops. Over the last 15 periods (P25-P39), mean demand is approximately 190. Standard deviation is elevated due to these outliers, and I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 180 to maintain a high service level for potential spikes. Lead time has recently stabilized at 1-2 periods, so I am using L=2 (explicit) to ensure the system calculates coverage for 3 periods (L+1). Note: Pipeline inventory is consistently inflated by 198 units effectively lost since Period 2. The Current In-transit (1052) includes these 198 units, meaning actual effective pipeline is 854. With on-hand inventory at 543, we have 1397 units of effective total inventory. mu_hat is set to (1+2)*190 = 570. Given the high inventory levels already present (1397 vs a base stock requirement including safety stock), I expect the OR engine to place a zero or minimal order this period to burn off excess holding cost while maintaining a buffer for the next spike.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volatility seasonal regime. Over the most recent period (P24-P40), the mean demand is approximately 190 with a high standard deviation (approx 160) due to extreme spikes like P35 (688). Lead times have recently stabilized to 1-2 periods. Crucially, the 'In-transit' inventory of 1052 units includes 198 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 854 units. With On-hand inventory at 368 units, the total effective inventory is 1222 units. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), we need a robust base stock that accounts for both the elevated mean and the significant variance. I will use recent_N (N=17, covering the high-volatility regime since P24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this behavior, while setting L to 2 to reflect the recent realized lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline inventory parity confirmed as total In-transit minus 198 (lost P2 units). Recent lead times (P36-P37) suggest stabilization at 1-2 periods despite previous instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1432.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volatility seasonal regime. While we observed extreme spikes in Period 33 (399) and Period 35 (688), the most recent four periods (P38-P41) have averaged 140.25 units, showing a relative cooling but maintaining high variance compared to the early-game baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 278 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline is 1052 units, but this includes 198 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 854 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 1132 units. Given the lead time has stabilized at approximately 2 periods (as seen in P36-P37 arrivals), and the 1132 units cover roughly 8 periods of recent average demand, no new order is required. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the recent stabilization at 2 periods, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the high-volatility regime since P24) to capture the seasonal mean, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=18 to maintain high safety stock against potential late-season spikes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from an extreme seasonal spike (Period 35: 688) back into a high-variance but lower-volume state. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 190, though with an extremely high standard deviation (approx 180) due to the P35 outlier. Recent lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (P36: 1, P37: 2). The pipeline inventory (1052) contains 198 lost units from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 854. With 212 units on hand, the total effective inventory is 1066. At a mean demand of ~190, this covers over 5 periods of supply, which is sufficient for a 2-period lead time environment. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the post-peak mean and explicit for sigma_hat to maintain high safety stock given the massive volatility (688 to 0). Lead time is set to calculate to reflect the recent improvement in speed.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand has receded from the P35 extreme (688) to a mean of ~190 (P33-P42). Lead times have improved to 1-2 periods as of P37. Effective pipeline remains In-transit minus 198 (lost P2 units).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing post-peak seasonal demand for 'chips(Regular)'. In Period 43, demand spiked again to 352, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' pipeline is 1052 units, but this includes 198 units lost from Period 2 (Carry-over insight), making the effective pipeline 854 units. Recent demand (P33-P43) has shown extreme volatility, moving between 0 and 688, with a recent mean of approximately 204 units per period. The lead time has stabilized at 1-2 periods. To ensure availability given the recent stockout and high volatility, I will use an 'explicit' lead time L of 1.5 (reflecting the 1-2 period trend). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (P33-P43) to capture the current high-volatility regime (mean ~204, so (1+1.5)*204 = 510). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extreme standard deviation observed during this seasonal window (SD \u2248 190, so sqrt(2.5)*190 \u2248 300). This keeps the base stock high enough to buffer against the spikes seen in P35 and P43 while acknowledging the effective pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system is recovering from a recent high-demand sequence (P43-P44 demands were 352 and 349). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is 1052 units. Accounting for the 198 permanently lost units from Period 2 (confirmed in Carry-over insights), the effective pipeline is 854 units. Recent demand analysis: While the extreme seasonal spike of P35 (688) has passed, the last two periods show a significant resurgence in demand compared to the P38-P42 lull (mean ~115). The mean of the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approx 240, reflecting significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~206). Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (per P36-P37 arrivals), though historical instability suggests caution. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-volatility, post-spike regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the full observed lead time distribution. This ensures the base stock target accounts for the recent demand resurgence while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering against the 854 effective units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand resurgence: P43-P44 demand averaged 350.5, a significant increase from the P38-P42 average of 125, confirming sustained high volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another high-volatility phase. After a relatively quiet period (P37-P42), demand surged again with P43-P45 averaging 314 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a significant pipeline total of 1429 units. However, as noted in previous carry-over insights, 198 of these units (from Period 2) are confirmed lost and never arrived, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 1231 units. Given the recent spike, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 750 (representing a forecast of 250 units/period over the lead time + current period) and sigma_hat explicitly to 300 to account for high variance (evidenced by recent demands of 352, 349, and 242). This aggressive safety stock is necessary to recover from the current stockout. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with the most recent arrivals in P36-P37, though volatility remains a risk.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand remains high: P43-P45 mean is 314.3 units, confirming the high-volatility regime continues even after the extreme P35 seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a sustained high-volatility state. Over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), demand has averaged 280 units (352, 349, 242, 177), which is significantly higher than the baseline. Lead times have recently stabilized at approximately 2 periods. The total In-transit pipeline of 1429 units includes 198 units lost from Period 2, which has been consistently flagged in carry-over insights. Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline is 1231 units. Given that we are at Period 47 out of 50, and the effective pipeline (1231) already covers over 4 periods of demand at the current high average (280 * 4 = 1120), the inventory position is likely sufficient to cover the remaining periods. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent high-demand mean of 280 across the (L+1) horizon to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for this surge, while maintaining the recent lead time estimate of 2.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike high demand regime confirmed: P43-P46 average demand is 280 units, a sustained increase from previous levels. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime. After a series of stockouts from Period 43 to Period 47 (starting on-hand 0, demand peaking at 352), on-hand inventory remains 0. The current In-transit inventory of 1429 units includes 198 units confirmed lost since Period 2, making the effective pipeline 1231 units. While Period 47 showed 0 demand, this follows a significant period of back-to-back high demand (P43-P45 averaged ~314 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend is already biased toward high service levels (q\u22480.95). I will use a recent_N window for demand and volatility to capture the post-spike levels (P43-P47 mean is ~224) while acknowledging the lead time has stabilized around 2 periods. The OR backend's cap and base stock logic will automatically subtract the (inflated) pipeline from the target. By keeping parameters aligned with the recent mean (~224) and high variance, we ensure the system maintains enough pressure to refill the empty on-hand stock despite the 198-unit pipeline phantom.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The primary objective is to maximize profit while managing the persistent 198-unit inflation in the 'In-transit' inventory caused by the lost Period 2 order. Total In-transit is currently 1429, which effectively means 1231 units are actually expected (1429 - 198). The demand regime remains in a high-volatility state, though recent demand has fluctuated (P43-P45 averaged ~314, P47-P48 averaged 74). To ensure we cover the remaining period without over-ordering and incurring holding costs at the final whistle, I am setting mu_hat based on the high-volatility regime (last 6 periods, P43-P48, avg ~211) and using the 'recent_N' method for sigma to account for the extreme variance seen recently. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has stabilized between 1-3 periods (avg ~2.1) recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been highly volatile, with recent peaks including 338 in Period 49 and 352 in Period 43. The current In-transit inventory is 1429 units, but this includes the 198 units lost from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 1231 units. Given that no orders were placed between Period 45 and Period 49, and lead times have recently been around 1-2 periods, we are likely awaiting the arrival of the large order from Period 45 (377 units) and potentially replenishment from earlier unrecorded system orders that populate the 'In-transit' total. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using recent_N=7 to capture the post-spike high-volatility regime (averaging ~180-200 units per period) and set sigma_hat to explicit to reflect the high standard deviation observed (~130 units) to ensure sufficient safety stock. I will assume a standard lead time (L) of 2 periods based on the most recent confirmed arrivals (P36, P37).
