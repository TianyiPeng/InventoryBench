Historical demand for the 'chips(Regular)' SKU over the last 5 periods was 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127, yielding an average of 92.4 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests a capped order of 197 units based on the promised lead time (L=2) and a critical fractile calculated from the $19.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a pipeline immediately to cover demand for the lead-time duration (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR recommendation of 197 units roughly covers ~2.1 periods of average demand, which is slightly conservative but reasonable given the high variance in history (ranging from 0 to 170).

Strategy: With a pipeline of 445 units and an average demand of ~110, we have roughly 4 periods of supply already. Even with lead-time uncertainty, the OR recommendation of 4 units is very conservative because our inventory position is quite high relative to recent demand.

  "rationale": "The inventory system currently shows 2,276 units in-transit, but historical data and carry-over insights indicate that a massive portion of this pipeline is comprised of lost shipments from periods as far back as P2. Specifically, known or highly probable lost orders include P2, P6, P17-P19, P25, P29-P30, and P33 (totaling 1,766 units). Subtracting these from the 2,276 reported in-transit units leaves a realistic pipeline of 510 units (from orders P41, P42, and P43). Current on-hand inventory is very low at 21 units. Recent demand has been volatile, ranging from 66 to 352 units in the last three periods, with an average of approximately 170 units since Period 17, though spikes like P35 (688) and P43 (352) have occurred. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the massive (but false) pipeline figure. To maintain coverage for the target (L+1) = 3 periods at a safe demand estimate of ~200 units per period (600 total needed), and accounting for the realistic pipeline of 510 (P41: 180, P42: 180, P43: 150) plus 21 on-hand, we have 531 units expected.

This leaves an effective pipeline of only 480 units (orders from P42, P43, P44). Demand has shifted upwards, with the last two periods averaging ~350 units. With 0 on-hand inventory, we are in a stockout position. While the actual order arrivals have been intermittent (LT=3 for P40 and P41), the current effective pipeline (480) barely covers 1.5 periods of recent demand.

Effective Pipeline Calculation: Total In-transit (2966) - Likely Lost (1766) = 1200 units.

Furthermore, orders from P44 (150), P45 (350), P46 (350), P47 (350), and P48 (350) have not arrived. P44 is now 5 periods old (exceeding the observed 3-period max lead time), making it likely lost (+150 units). P45 is 4 periods old, also likely lost (+350 units).
