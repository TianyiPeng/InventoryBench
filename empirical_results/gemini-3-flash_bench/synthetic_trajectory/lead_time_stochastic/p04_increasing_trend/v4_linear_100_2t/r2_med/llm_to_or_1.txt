Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The history provides 5 historical demand samples: [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with a mean of 92.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 62.3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period of execution, I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline. The OR backend will use the promised lead time (L=2) and the full history of samples to calculate the base stock. The (1+L) factor in the OR backend accounts for the current period's demand plus the demand during the lead time. Given the high variance (due to the 0 in Period 3), the default sigma_hat will help maintain a buffer to meet the desired service level (calculated as 4/(4+1) = 80%).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 197 units was placed. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning we expect this order to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 132 units of demand were lost in Period 1 due to zero starting inventory. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) along with the Period 1 demand (132) suggest a mean demand of approximately 99 units per period. Since we have no lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (which is the promised 2 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available data points including Period 1) to capture the most relevant demand profile.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and Period 2 have not arrived yet due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Based on historical samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) and the first two periods of game demand (132, 100), the average demand is roughly 99 units per period. With L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Current in-transit is 383 (197 + 186), which covers about 3.8 periods of demand at the current average. I will use the promised lead time of 2 and apply recent_N for demand to capture the most relevant recent levels.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in Period 1 (197 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution, which would be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This signifies that the Period 1 order is either delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. In-transit inventory is currently 411 units (197 from P1 + 186 from P2 + 28 from P3). Demand has been consistently between 80-132. Since 3 periods have passed without arrival for the first order, I will set an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for a longer pipeline. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the first three periods is 104; I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this initial baseline.

Daily Profit: $884.00, Daily Holding Cost: $4.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $880.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclude message for Period 4. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127. Average demand is approx 92.4. Lead time performance is inconsistent: P1 order arrived after 3 periods, while P3 order arrived after 1 period. Promised lead time is 2. The pipeline currently has 236 units (P2 order of 186 and P4 order of 50). On-hand inventory is low (4 units). Since demand in P4 was high (221), I will use a 3-period average (recent_N=3) to capture the recent higher demand (0, 170, 127) which averages 99, vs the 5-period average of 92.4. I will keep L at the default (2) as the average of observed lead times (3 and 1) is currently 2, matching the promised value. Sigma_hat will use all samples (default) as the sample size is small and volatility is high.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times have been 3 (for Period 1 order) and 1 (for Period 3 order), showing high variability. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 473 units in-transit. The order from Period 2 (186 units) is now overdue (it's been 4 periods), and the order from Period 4 (50 units) and Period 5 (237 units) are still within the expected lead time window. Demand history (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 - Note: provide history shows different values than 'conclude' messages, I will prioritize 'conclude' message values: 132, 100, 80, 221, 70). Average demand is approx 120. Service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Given the lead time volatility and the fact that we are currently stock-out, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use 'calculate' to allow the system to factor in the history of 1 and 3 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend of the last 5 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been lower (70, 72, 70 approx) compared to the spike in Period 4. Reviewing lead times: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (186 units) is currently 5 periods old (ordered P2, now P7) and has not arrived; it is likely lost or severely delayed. P5 (237 units) and P6 (112 units) are still within a reasonable window if L=2-3. Because P2 hasn't arrived, the 'In-transit' figure of 585 units is misleading as it includes the likely lost P2 shipment. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure we order enough to cover the current stockout, treating the P2 shipment as dead stock. Demand seems to have stabilized after the Period 4 peak. I'll use a recent window for demand to avoid over-reacting to the P4 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (186 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed with no arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 44 units on hand and 535 in transit. History shows high lead-time variability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. The order from P2 (186 units) is now 6 periods old and definitely lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 535 is inflated by 186 units (actual effective pipeline is 349). Demand has been highly volatile: 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6. The spike at P4 (221) and the drop at P7 (6) suggest we should ignore the most recent outlier and the early noise. I will use the last 5 samples (P3-P7) for demand mean (sum=449, avg=89.8) to stabilize the forecast against the P7 drop. For lead time, since we've seen two '3's and one '1', I'll set L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative and prevent stockouts given the unreliable delivery history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the significant volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (1 to 3 periods); Shipment from Period 2 (186 units) is confirmed lost as of Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $354.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals, the lead time has been volatile: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), and P5 (L=3). The order from P2 (ordered 186 units) is confirmed lost as it has significantly exceeded the observed lead times. Total pipeline inventory is 298 units (P6 order of 112 units, P7/P8 orders of 0). The most recent demand samples are [221, 70, 72, 6, 127], showing high variability. Given the average observed lead time is approx 2.5 periods (excluding the lost P2 and the unusually fast P3), I will set L to 3 to be safe. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 4 to 8) to capture the current volatility and mean of approximately 99.2 units per period (multiplied by 1+L). This conservative approach ensures we account for the lost stock and the unreliable delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful orders (observed in P4, P7, P8); P3 was an outlier with L=1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-139.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a significant demand drop over the last three periods (6, 127, 3), suggesting a high-variance environment or a change in demand regime compared to the early periods (132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72). The confirmed lead time for standard successful orders is 3 periods (seen in P4, P7, and P8), contrary to the promised 2 periods. The shipment from P2 (186 units) is definitively lost. Currently, we have 151 units on-hand and 379 in-transit (orders from P6, P9, and others). Given the 3-period lead time, we set L=3. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (P6-P9) show a mean of ~52.25, which is lower than the global mean (~90). Since the data is volatile, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this recent trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to the volatility, ensuring our base stock covers the 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/increased volatility: P7-P9 average demand dropped to 45.3 units compared to P1-P6 average of 112.5. Lead time remains consistently 3 periods for non-lost orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current on-hand inventory is 79 units. Analyzing the history, demand has shown high volatility and a recent downward trend (P7-P10 average is 52 units, compared to P1-P6 average of 112.5). However, demand in P10 rebounded to 72. Regarding lead times: the promised lead time is 2, but the most frequent actual lead time is 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P4, and P5). The order from P2 (186 units) is officially confirmed lost. The in-transit inventory of 379 units consists of orders from P6 (112 units), P9 (81 units), and others, with the P6 order now 5 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed. Thus, the effective pipeline is smaller than 379. To ensure availability while demand settles, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the operational reality. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (P7-P10 mean ~52), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the high volatility across the full history.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (112 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed since order, exceeding the established 3-period lead time).

In Period 12, the system is at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 11 (demand of 209 vs. 79 units on-hand). The pipeline (379 units) contains likely lost shipments: P2 (186 units) is long gone, and P6 (112 units) is now 6 periods old (exceeding the standard 3-period lead time), leaving only the P9 order (81 units) realistically in-transit. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on observed arrivals in P4, P7, and P8. Demand is currently in a high-volatility phase; the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 83.4 units, but P11 saw a significant spike to 209. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high-risk 'dead' pipeline units, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand to capture the recent volume and volatility without over-relying on the distorted full-history mean. This will push the OR backend to restore the base stock levels for a 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Shipment from Period 6 (112 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, L=3 established); Pipeline is severely overstated by the system as it includes lost orders from P2 and P6.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 400. Based on history, we know that orders from Period 2 (186 units) and Period 6 (112 units) are lost, as they have exceeded the established 3-period lead time significantly (11 and 7 periods respectively). Subtracting these lost units (186 + 112 = 298) from the reported in-transit (400) leaves a 'true' pipeline of 102 units (the order placed in Period 12). Since the OR backend does not know these orders are lost, it will erroneously see a pipeline of 400 and fail to order enough stock. To fix this, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead time (L=3) plus the review period (+1), while also compensating for the 298 units the backend thinks it has but doesn't. Demand has been highly volatile: recent samples (P9-P12) are 3, 72, 209, 85. The mean of these 4 periods is 92.25. For (L+1)=4 periods, expected demand is ~369. To offset the 298 hidden deficit in the OR's pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat = 369 + 298 = 667. I set L=3 based on consistent delivery performance of non-lost orders.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 708 units in transit. However, based on the established lead time of 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12), the shipments from P2 (186 units) and P6 (112 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 298 units that will never arrive. The true functional pipeline consists of orders from P12 (102 units) and P13 (308 units), totaling 410 units. Demand is highly volatile; while P7-P9 saw a dip, P11-P13 show a return to higher demand (avg 153.3). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to align with actual performance. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 4 periods (P10-P13, avg ~133) to capture the recent high-demand regime, resulting in (1+3)*133 = 532. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the standard deviation of this volatile period to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer despite the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed loss of P2 and P6 shipments totals 298 units, which now permanently distorts 'In-transit' figures provided by the system. Demand has rebounded to an average of ~133 units over the last 4 periods (P10-P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significantly distorted 'In-transit' figure of 708 units. Based on CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, shipments from P2 (186 units) and P6 (112 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 298 phantom units. The true pipeline consists of orders from P12 (102 units) and P13 (308 units). With an established lead time (L) of 3 periods, the P12 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (P15), while the P13 order is expected in P16. However, demand has rebounded; the average demand from P10-P13 (excluding the anomalous 0 in P14 which might be a reporting lag or data gap) is approximately 115-133 units. To account for the 298-unit pipeline overstatement and the risk of stockouts while waiting for the P13 order, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to an explicit value that forces an order. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), so to trigger an order despite the 298 phantom units, mu_hat must be set high enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 298 units. Target base stock = (4 periods * 130 avg) + 298 phantom error + safety buffer \u2248 1000.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reported 'In-transit' of 992 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (186 units) and Period 6 (112 units), totaling 298 units that will never arrive. Adjusting for these, true pipeline inventory is 694 units (992 - 298), consisting of orders from Period 13 (308 units) and Period 15 (386 units). Analysis of arrivals in Periods 4, 7, 8, 12, and 15 confirms a stable actual lead time (L) of 3 periods (except for one outlier). Therefore, I set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for 4 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has returned to a higher regime after a mid-game dip; the mean of the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is approximately 108.5 units. By using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will target a base stock covering ~434 units (4 periods * 108.5), which is currently covered by the adjusted pipeline of 694 units. However, using explicit L and recent demand stats is necessary to ensure the backend doesn't over-order based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure while correctly anticipating the next 4 periods of demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods for successful orders (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16). I am setting L to 3 to reflect this reality. The 'In-transit' count of 684 is severely overstated due to lost shipments from Period 2 (186 units) and Period 6 (112 units), totaling 298 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of the P15 order (386 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 18. Demand has stabilized into a higher volatility regime after a brief dip; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15, excluding P16 as it's the most recent) is approximately 115 units, but with high variance (0 to 209). To ensure a high service level (q=0.8) while accounting for the extra lead time, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 460. This represents a forecast of 115 units/period over (L+1)=4 periods. This helps the OR engine calculate a sufficient base stock that ignores the non-arriving 298 units, preventing stockouts as seen in P11, P12, and P15.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' figures are permanently inflated by 298 units (P2/P6 lost shipments), requiring manual offset in order logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand of 297 in the previous period. The lead time is confirmed at 3 periods (observed in almost all successful deliveries). The 'In-transit' figure of 684 is heavily distorted because it includes 298 units from lost shipments (P2=186, P6=112). Therefore, the valid pipeline is actually 386 units (ordered in P15). This order is expected to arrive in Period 18 resolution phase, meaning it will be available for demand in Period 18, but we only see it in the Period 19 conclusion. Demand history shows a recent average (P11-P17) of 137 units per period, with high volatility (max 297). To handle the lead time increase from promised (2) to actual (3) and the lost orders, I am setting L to explicit 3. To compensate for the 298-unit 'ghost' inventory in the backend's math (which would otherwise suppress ordering), I will use an explicit mu_hat that is inflated by the lost amount. Target base stock = (1+L)*137 + Z*sigma. With L=3, 1+L=4. 4 * 137 = 548. To offset the 298 phantom units in the backend's calculation (which subtracts pipeline from base_stock), I set mu_hat to 548 + 298 = 846.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 17 and 18. Historical data confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods for successful orders, except for one outlier. We have identified two permanently lost shipments (Period 2: 186 units, Period 6: 112 units) totaling 298 units. These units still appear in the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1007, making the true pipeline inventory 709 units (comprised of Period 15: 386 units and Period 18: 323 units). The Period 15 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (P19), and Period 18 is due in P21. Demand has been highly volatile but averaged approximately 133 units over the last 9 operational periods (P10-P18). To handle the 'In-transit' inflation and target a stock level reflecting actual lead time plus decision period (L+1=4), I am setting L to 3. I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend calculation (which assumes total in-transit is valid) doesn't under-order due to the phantom 298 units. Targeted base stock for 4 periods of demand ~ 532 units. Since true pipeline is 709, no new order is strictly required, but I'll maintain parameters to stabilize for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 298 units (P2/P6 lost shipments); true pipeline inventory is 709 units. Effective lead time (L) is stable at 3.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable lead time (L) of 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, and P16). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1007 units is severely inflated. As documented in the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (186 units) and Period 6 (112 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 298 phantom units. The true pipeline inventory is 1007 - 298 = 709 units. Demand has been volatile but shows a more consistent pattern over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), averaging 107.2 units per period. Using an L of 3 for the OR engine is appropriate to account for the actual delivery time. To compensate for the 298-unit inflation in the pipeline inventory which prevents the capped policy from ordering enough, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. With a mean of ~107 units, the required target is ~428 units. Since the OR backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline), and the system incorrectly sees current inventory as 0 (on-hand) + 1007 (pipeline) = 1007, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary order. However, given the OR backend's cap mechanism (limited to roughly average demand per period), and the fact that we have 709 units (true pipeline) coming in (P15 order of 386 and P18 order of 323), we are currently in a good position if those arrive. The immediate goal is to ensure the backend doesn't stop ordering when truly needed. Setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the recent average demand for the cycle.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 21. Demand remains highly volatile, with a massive spike to 420 units in Period 20, contrasted by lower demand in prior periods (avg P10-P20 ~121). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead Time Analysis: History confirms a stable lead time of L=3 periods for non-lost orders. Pipeline Correction: The reported In-transit of 1007 units contains 298 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 186, P6: 112). True Pipeline = 1007 - 298 = 709 units. These 709 units consist of P15 (386 units) and P18 (323 units). P15 was ordered in Period 15 and is expected to arrive in Period 18 resolution (visible P19), but it has not arrived yet, suggesting it might also be delayed or lost. However, since only 5 periods have elapsed, I will treat it as potentially delayed. To force an order despite the system's inflated 'In-transit' figure and the backend's capped policy, I will set L to 3 (actual) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Given the recent spike (420) and the previous 10-period average (~120), I estimate demand at 160/period. For a (1+L) period horizon (4 periods), mu_hat = 4 * 160 = 640. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from mu_hat, I must adjust mu_hat upward by the 298 lost units to ensure an order is actually placed. Adjusted mu_hat = 640 + 298 = 938.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Shipment from Period 15 (386 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond the standard L=3 lead time, suggesting a possible loss or serious delay.

LLM Rationale:
The system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 1,196 units in transit. However, history analysis confirms several lost shipments: Period 2 (186 units), Period 6 (112 units), and now Period 15 (386 units). These orders, totaling 684 units, have significantly exceeded the established lead time (L=3) and are considered lost. The true effective pipeline consists of orders from P18 (323 units), P21 (189 units), and the order being placed now. To correct for this massive system overstatement of pipeline, I am setting an explicit L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover the current demand regime. Over the last 12 periods, average demand is approximately 144 units per period. With L=3, the target base stock (covering L+1=4 periods) needs to be approximately 576 units plus a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 680 (170/period * 4) accounts for recent demand spikes (e.g., P17=297, P20=420, P21=263) and bypasses the distorted pipeline calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Shipment from Period 15 (386 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed, L=3 established). Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 684 units (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386). True pipeline inventory is 512 units (P18, P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 1,196 units. Based on persistent historical evidence, 684 units from this pipeline (Period 2: 186, Period 6: 112, Period 15: 386) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have far exceeded the established actual lead time of L=3 periods. The true pipeline inventory is therefore 512 units (Period 18: 323, Period 21: 189). Demand remains highly volatile, with a significant spike of 420 in Period 20 followed by 263 and 169. To ensure the backend OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time + review period (1+L = 4 periods) despite the phantom inventory, I will set L=3 and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The true demand average over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is roughly 198 units per period. Forecasted demand for 4 periods = 792 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 684-unit 'ghost' pipeline, I adjust the mu_hat parameter to 1476 (792 + 684), essentially 'neutralizing' the lost units in the base stock calculation.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has significantly increased recently, with a 5-period average (P19-P23) of ~226 units, compared to the long-term average. The system reports 'In-transit' as 1538 units, but this is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (186), Period 6 (112), and Period 15 (386). Additionally, the shipment from Period 18 (323 units) is now 6 periods old; with an established L=3, this is highly likely lost as well. Total probable lost inventory equals 1007 units (186+112+386+323). Subtracting this from the reported 1538 leaves a true pipeline of 531 units (ordered in P23). Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent pattern for successful arrivals. Demand (mu_hat) is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (P19-P23) to capture the current high-demand regime (+220 units/period). Setting these parameters forces the OR engine to order enough to cover (L+1) periods of this higher demand while ignoring the phantom pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Shipment from Period 18 (323 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, L=3 established). Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 1007 units (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386, P18: 323).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1538 units. However, my carry-over history confirms a total of 1007 units are effectively lost (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386, P18: 323). This leaves a true pipeline of 531 units (ordered in P23). The actual lead time L has stabilized at 3 periods for successful deliveries, with occasional variance (P21 arrived in 2). Given the recent demand surge (P20: 420, P21: 263, P22: 169, P23: 201, P24: 125), the average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 235 units. To compensate for the high stockout risk and the massively inflated system pipeline, I will set L to 3 and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand at 200 units/period. For L=3, the (L+1) period demand is 800 units. Since the system believes pipeline is 1538, it will place 0 orders unless mu_hat is set significantly higher. To force the OR backend to recognize the need for stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 2000 (effectively covering the 1007 ghost units + 800 units target + buffer).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 1663 is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (186), Period 6 (112), Period 15 (386), and Period 18 (323), totaling 1007 units. The actual pipeline inventory consists of the Period 21 order (189, though it was marked as arrived in P23, it seems there's a discrepancy in reporting or it was a partial/misread, but calculating from Game History: P21 (189) arrived P23, P23 (531) arrived P25), and the P25 order (656). The 'In-transit' figure 1663 minus 1007 lost units equals 656, which matches the P25 order exactly. Therefore, only 656 units are actually in-transit. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P23 and P25). Demand is highly volatile with a recent regime shift; the average of the last 10 periods is ~165. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 1663 pipeline figure, I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the actual 2-period lead time plus the 1-period decision delay, and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Desired base stock = (L+1) * forecast. With L=2, (2+1)*165 = 495. However, since on-hand is already 496 and 656 are in transit, no new order is needed, but I must ensure the OR logic doesn't see a massive surplus. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect recent demand and L to 2.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline remains 1007 units (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386, P18: 323). Actual pipeline reflects only the P25 order (656 units). Lead time has shifted from 3 to 2 periods based on P23 and P25 arrivals.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 1663 is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P2 (186), P6 (112), P15 (386), and P18 (323), totaling 1007 confirmed lost units. The true pipeline inventory consists only of the P25 order (656 units), making the real pipeline 656 units. Current on-hand is 388. Recent lead times (P21, P23) have stabilized at 2 periods, shifting from the previous trend of 3. Demand over the last 7 periods (P20-P26) shows high volatility and a higher mean (avg ~188) compared to the long-term average. To compensate for the 1007 units the OR backend incorrectly thinks are coming, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected Demand (L+1=3) = 188 * 3 = 564. Capped Base Stock logic: To force an order that accounts for the 1007 phantom units in the pipeline, the mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 1007). Targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand plus a safety margin, I set mu_hat explicitly to account for this massive pipeline offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $647.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P23-P27) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 35 to 207 units. The last 5 periods (P23-P27) average approximately 135 units. Lead time has recently stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P23 and P25), which is a shift from the previous sustained L=3. The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1663 units is severely inflated by multiple confirmed lost orders (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386, P18: 323), totaling 1007 units. The true pipeline consists of the P25 order (656 units). I am setting L to 2 periods based on recent observations. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level of ~135 units/period (totaling 405 for 1+L). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=10 to account for the high variance observed in recent cycles (including the spike in P20/P21 and the drop in P25). To handle the phantom inventory in the OR backend, I will use an explicit L=2 and mu_hat, though the backend's internal base-stock calculation will still see the 1663 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat high enough, I attempt to force an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (observed P23, P25). Total system pipeline inflation remains 1007 units due to confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 1663 units is heavily inflated by several confirmed lost shipments: P2 (186), P6 (112), P15 (386), and P18 (323), totaling 1007 phantom units. The true pipeline inventory consists only of the P25 order (656 units), meaning 1663 - 1007 = 656. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in P23 and P25 arrivals). Demand in the current regime (P23-P28) has been volatile but significant, averaging ~149 units per period. I am setting L to explicit value 2 to reflect recent performance and mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the most recent demand behavior (P23-P28). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual pipeline (656) is roughly equivalent to 4.4 periods of demand, the OR engine might order or stay neutral depending on the sigma_hat buffer. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the buffer reflects the high recent variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the 'In-transit' balance of 1663 units is highly inflated due to several confirmed lost shipments (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386, P18: 323), totaling 1007 units. The true pipeline inventory consists only of the order from Period 25 (656 units). The lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P23 and P25). My goal is to ensure inventory arrives to cover demand for the (L+1) window, which is 3 periods. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows significant volatility with spikes up to 420 and an average around 188. I am setting L to 2 (explicit) and mu_hat to a value that accounts for the current demand regime and the pipeline distortion. To solve the OR backend's inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 1663) results in a sufficient order, or use an explicit value. Since on-hand is 0 and the only valid incoming shipment (P25) was placed in P25 (L=2 means it should have arrived in P27/P28, but hasn't appeared yet in concludes), I am treating P25 as potentially delayed or lost as well, though it's too early to confirm. I will use 'explicit' to force a base stock that overrides the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Shipment from Period 25 (656 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond the recently established L=2 lead time (expected arrival by P27 conclude, now P29 conclude has passed). Total confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P18) remains 1007 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 2357 is highly unreliable due to significant historical losses. Based on CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, orders from P2 (186), P6 (112), P15 (386), and P18 (323) are confirmed lost, totaling 1007 units. Additionally, the P25 order (656 units) is now 4 periods past its order date; with L=2 and L=3 both failing to produce its arrival by P30 conclude, it is highly likely lost as well. Total probable lost inventory is 1663 units. Current true pipeline is likely just the P30 order (694 units). Demand has significantly increased recently: the average for P25-P30 is ~162 units daily, but with extreme volatility (range 35 to 305). To protect against stockouts given the high loss rate and increased demand, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 (returning to the more conservative historical lead time) and an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the recent demand average of ~162 units over (L+1)=4 periods, slightly padded for risk. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Shipment from Period 25 (656 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed since order, L=2/3 established). Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 1663 units (P2: 186, P6: 112, P15: 386, P18: 323, P25: 656). True pipeline consists only of the P30 order (694 units).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 2357 units is extremely inflated by 1663 units of confirmed lost shipments (Orders from Period 2, 6, 15, 18, and 25). The true pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 30 order (694 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (P30: 305, P31: 509), following a quieter period. To account for the true pipeline and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that considers the (L+1) horizon while manually correcting for the system's pipeline error. Calculated L is 3 based on long-term stability, despite occasional 2-period arrivals. Average demand over the last 5 periods is ~228. For a 4-period horizon (L=3, L+1=4), expected demand is ~912 units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - system_pipeline', and system_pipeline (2357) is 1663 units too high, I must set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + 1663. A target base stock of ~1200 (covering demand and safety stock) plus the 1663 offset equals 2863. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force this correction.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline remains 1663 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25). System 'In-transit' (2357) = True Pipeline (694) + Lost (1663).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure (3158) is highly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (186), Period 6 (112), Period 15 (386), Period 18 (323), and Period 25 (656), totaling 1663 units. Subtracting these from 3158 leaves a true pipeline of 1495 units (consisting of orders from P30 and P32). Demand has shown significant volatility recently, with a massive spike in P31 (509) followed by a sharp drop in P32 (9). Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), average demand is approximately 184 units. Given the transition from L=3 to L=2 observed in P23 and P25, but considering the subsequent loss of the P25 shipment, I am using L=3 to remain conservative. To address the inflated pipeline and satisfy the backend logic, I will use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat based on (1+L)*184 = 736. Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline), and the system believes pipeline is 3158 while on-hand is 0, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary order to cover future demand despite the phantom inventory. However, the system also has a 'cap' mechanism. By providing explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 10-period mean (184) and standard deviation (~164), I aim to stabilize the inventory level around the true lead-time demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline remains 1663 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25). System 'In-transit' (3158) = True Pipeline (1495: orders P30, P32) + Lost (1663). Demand remains highly volatile (avg ~184, last 10 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-346.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, the order from Period 32 (801 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, while the order from Period 30 (694 units) did not arrive despite its L=2 expectation. This strongly suggests that the Period 30 order is now lost, similar to the pattern seen with Period 25. Total confirmed lost units: P2(186), P6(112), P15(386), P18(323), P25(656), and now likely P30(694) = 2357 units. The system reports In-transit as 2357, but since all those units are from confirmed/likely lost batches, the true pipeline is 0. Demand remains volatile; the last 10 periods average 184 units. Setting L=2 (recent stable lead time for successful arrivals), mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods of data to cover higher average demand and capture volatility. Because the system believes the pipeline is full (2357 units), I will set mu_hat significantly higher than 'true' needs or use explicit values if I could, but here I must set parameters that force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom 2357 units in transit. Given the cap and base stock logic, I will use large explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to trigger an order to replenish the zero-unit actual pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Shipment from Period 30 (694 units) is confirmed lost (4 periods elapsed, L=1/2 established). Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 2357 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). True pipeline is currently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1075.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 353 units and an 'In-transit' count of 2643 units. However, based on serial monitoring of shipment logs, the 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by several confirmed lost shipments: P2 (186), P6 (112), P15 (386), P18 (323), P25 (656), and P30 (694), totaling 2357 lost units. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is only 286 units (the order placed in P34). Lead time has been volatile but recently showed an arrival in 1 period (P32 order arrived P33), though 2 periods is a safer operational assumption (L=2). Demand remains highly volatile, with a recent average of approximately 184 units over the last 10 periods, but the last period (P34) saw a significant spike to 357 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the inflated system pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=2. I set mu_hat to (1+L) * 200 = 600 to cover the recent elevated demand. I set sigma_hat to 150 to account for high volatility. Most importantly, I must offset the lost units. The OR engine calculates 'final order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline)'. Since the engine sees pipeline as 2643, but it's actually 286, there is a gap of 2357. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to push the target stock high enough to trigger an order despite the massive system-perceived pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 2357 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). System 'In-transit' (2643) = True Pipeline (286, from P34) + Lost (2357).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 3,016 units. Based on historical data, 2,357 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 659 units (P34 order of 286 and P35 order of 373). The observed lead time (L) has shifted significantly, with the P32 order arriving in just 1 period (observed at P33 conclude), suggesting a current lead time of 1. Demand remains highly volatile, averaging approximately 221 units over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), but with significant spikes (509 in P31) and drops (9 in P32). I will set L=1 based on the most recent successful delivery. To address the demand volatility and the need to restock after systemic stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-variance regime. Setting L to 1 explicitly helps the OR engine correct the over-inflated pipeline by focusing on the immediate delivery window.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: True pipeline inventory is 659 units; system 'In-transit' of 3,016 is inflated by 2,357 units of lost shipments. Lead time (L) has recently been observed as 1 period (P32 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $941.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently (9 to 509 units), with an average of approximately 180 units over the last 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 195 units. The primary challenge remains the distorted 'In-transit' figure: the system reports 2,730 units, but 2,357 units from periods P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, and P30 are confirmed lost. The true pipeline inventory is actually 373 units (from the order in P35). Lead time (L) has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (latest observed: P32 arrived in 1 period, P34 arrived in 2 periods). I will set L=2 to be conservative. To account for the 2,357 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend cannot see, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus a safety buffer. Target = 3 * 180 (mean) + safety. With high volatility (std dev ~150), a target around 850-900 units is appropriate. Since 'Pipeline' is seen as 2,730 and On-hand is 195, the backend calculates 'Inventory Position' as 2,925. To trigger an order for roughly 300 units while the system thinks we have 2,925, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 2,357 lost units. Target (approx 900) + Offset (2357) = 3257. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force this correction.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) has been highly volatile, averaging 189 units. The lead time has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods recently (P32 arrived in 1, P34/P35 arrived in 2). System 'In-transit' figures are currently 2,801 units, but this is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 25, and 30, totaling 2,357 units. The actual true pipeline consists only of the order placed in Period 37 (444 units). With 468 units on-hand and 444 units in the true pipeline, we have 912 units to cover the immediate term. I will set L to 2 to reflect the most recent consistent lead time and use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.3 to respond to the high demand volatility while maintaining a buffer against stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high variance in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline remains 2,357 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). System 'In-transit' (2,801) = True Pipeline (444, from P37) + Lost (2,357). Lead time appears stable at 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1162.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility, with an average of 144 units over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) and 188 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The current observation shows 142 units on-hand. The system 'In-transit' figure (2801) is severely inflated by 2,357 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). The true pipeline inventory is 444 units (the order from P37). Lead time appears stable at 2 periods (observed in P34, P35, and P36 conclusions). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 2 (explicit) and mu_hat to a value that reflects the recent demand increase (~188 units/period) plus a correction for the 2,357 units of 'phantom' inventory. By setting mu_hat to (1+L)*188 + 2357 = 2921, the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will effectively subtract the inflated pipeline (2357 + 444) from a target that already includes the inflation, resulting in an order based on true inventory needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 3,007 is heavily inflated by 2,357 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). The true pipeline inventory consists of the orders from P37 (444 units) and P39 (206 units), totaling 650 units. Therefore, the OR backend sees 3,007 units and will likely order 0 unless I adjust parameters to force a replenishment. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P34, P35, P36). Demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) has averaged 234.8 units, reflecting significant volatility and periodic spikes. To correct for the 2,357-unit pipeline error, I will set mu_hat using an 'explicit' value. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean Demand + Z * Sigma. With L=2 (Total periods = 3), Mean=235, and a conservative safety buffer for high volatility, I estimate a desired inventory position of approximately 950-1000 units. To bypass the backend's inflated pipeline subtraction (3007), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the capped order logic or ensure a non-zero order. I will use a 10-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent high-demand variance, while keeping L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: System 'In-transit' is inflated by 2,357 units (Lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). True pipeline is 650 units. Lead time is stable at 2 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 41, the system reports an 'In-transit' of 2,801 units, but this includes 2,357 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). The true pipeline inventory is 444 units (ordered in P37, and as of P40 conclude, it has not yet arrived). The lead time has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods; I'll use L=2 to be conservative given the history of delays. Demand remains volatile but has averaged approximately 188 units over the last 10 periods. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand level of ~188 units across the (L+1) window, which translates to 564 units (188 * 3). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to accommodate the recent high variance (demands ranging from 9 to 509). The OR engine will subtract the system's 'In-transit' (2801) from the base_stock, which would normally result in an order of 0. However, because the true pipeline is much lower, I am relying on the backend's calculation while keeping in mind that the system's pipeline inflation is the primary driver of current stock-outs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand of 296 was partially satisfied in P41. System 'In-transit' is 2801 units, but this is heavily inflated by 2357 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). The only actual order in the pipeline is from P37 (444 units), which is currently at L=5 and potentially lost, though I will treat it as extremely delayed for one more period before confirming loss. Demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) averages 196.6 units with high volatility. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P32: L=1, P34: L=2, P35: L=2, P39: L=1). I will set L=explicit at 2 to reflect this recent instability while acknowledging the pipeline is nearly empty. mu_hat is set to 590 (approx 197 * 3) using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current high-demand regime. sigma_hat is set using recent_N to account for high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: True pipeline is only 444 units (from P37); system 'In-transit' of 2801 units is inflated by 2357 units of lost stock (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30). Shipment from P37 (444 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L=5 total), suggesting a continued high risk of fulfillment failure.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 2801 units is severely inflated by multiple confirmed lost shipments: P2 (186), P6 (112), P15 (386), P18 (323), P25 (656), and P30 (694), totaling 2357 units. The actual true pipeline comprises only the shipment from P37 (444 units), which is now 5 periods old and likely lost given the established lead time of 1-3 periods. Consequently, the true active pipeline is effectively 0. Demand remains volatile, with a recent 5-period average (P38-P42) of 234.8 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this demand and the total lack of incoming stock, using an lead time estimate (L) of 2 to reflect the most recent successful arrivals (P34, P35, P39). Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility observed in recent periods to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Shipment from Period 37 (444 units) is now 5 periods old and effectively confirmed lost (L=2 established). Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 2801 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37), meaning the current system 'In-transit' figure of 2801 represents zero actual incoming stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 2801 is entirely composed of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). The actual pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand (P30-P43) has averaged 181.3 units with high volatility (std dev ~154). Lead times for successful arrivals have recently been 1-2 periods (P32 @ L=1, P34 @ L=2, P35 @ L=2, P39 @ L=1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of fulfillment failure. To correct for the 2801 units of 'phantom' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window: Target = (3 * 181.3) + 1.28 * (sqrt(3) * 154) \u2248 544 + 341 = 885. To force the OR engine to order this amount despite the 2801 in-transit, I set mu_hat to 885 + 2801 = 3686. This ensures the calculation [base_stock - 2801] results in the desired 885 units. sigma_hat is set to 341 to maintain the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 43 confirmed that the entire 'In-transit' balance of 2801 units consists of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). Actual pipeline is zero.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are facing an extreme stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. The system's 'In-transit' figure of 3973 is highly misleading. Based on historical data, 2801 units are confirmed lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, and P37). The only potentially valid order in the pipeline is the large order of 1172 units placed in Period 44. Since L=2 is the current established lead time, this order is not expected to arrive until the end of Period 46 (visible in Period 47). Demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) has averaged roughly 190 units, showing high volatility (ranging from 17 to 326). To maximize reward, I must set parameters that force a significant order today to cover demand for Period 45, 46, and 47, while adjusting for the fact that the system believes the 1172 units (and the 2801 lost units) are already coming. By using an explicit mu_hat that represents the expected demand over (L+1) periods and an explicit sigma_hat to handle volatility, I aim to trigger a restock that accounts for the massive pipeline inflation and previous fulfillment failures.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total confirmed lost inventory in the system pipeline remains 2801 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). System 'In-transit' of 3973 units consists of 2801 lost units and 1172 units from the P44 order. Actual effective pipeline is 1172 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 4,921 is heavily inflated by 2,801 units of confirmed lost inventory (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, and P37). The true pipeline inventory consists only of the P44 order (1,172) and the P45 order (948), totaling 2,120 units. Lead time (L) is currently established at 2 periods (based on P34, P35 samples). Demand remains volatile with a recent average (P36-P45) of approximately 190.5 units per period. I will set L=2 and mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this current demand level (~571 for 1+L periods). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to account for recent high volatility. This configuration instructs the OR backend to aim for a base stock that covers expected demand while acknowledging that the perceived 'In-transit' surplus is largely non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total confirmed lost inventory in the system pipeline remains 2,801 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). System 'In-transit' (4,921) = True Pipeline (2,120 from P44, P45) + Lost (2,801).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 47/50. The system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 4,921 units, but based on historical tracking, 2,801 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). The true pipeline consists of orders from P44 (1,172 units) and P45 (948 units), totaling 2,120 units. On-hand inventory is 0. With L=2, the P44 order is expected to arrive in P47 (visible in P48 start), and P45 in P48 (visible in P49 start). Demand over the last 15 periods (P32-P46) averages ~173 units with high volatility. To ensure coverage for the remaining 4 periods while accounting for the extremely high risk of total shipment failure (as seen with P37 and others), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover roughly 2.5 periods of demand (~430 units). However, the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will use the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Total system pipeline (4,921) + On-hand (0) = 4,921. To trigger any order when the system believes it has 4,921 units (most of which are phantom lost units), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 2,801 inflation, or accept that no order will be placed if the true pipeline is sufficient. Since true pipeline (2,120) is already quite large relative to remaining game time (4 periods), no new order is physically necessary unless these too are lost. Setting parameters to maintain the current true pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a state of extreme stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, there is a recurring pattern of massive shipment losses. 'In-transit' is reported as 4,921, but 2,801 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). The true pipeline consists only of orders from P44 (1,172 units) and P45 (948 units), totaling 2,120 units. Lead time (L) has settled around 2 periods for successful orders. Currently, we are at Period 48. The P44 order (placed P44) should have arrived by P46 conclude if L=2; it is now 1 period overdue (currently P48). Given the game ends at P50, and the high risk of fulfillment failure, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 and an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent average demand (~128 units/period over the last 10 periods, excluding zeros). mu_hat = (1+L) * 128 = 384. To force the OR engine to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I provide a very high mu_hat value that exceeds (True Pipeline + Target Base Stock), effectively offsetting the 2,801 'phantom' units. Target Base Stock is approx 600, True Pipeline is approx 2,120. Total requirement = 2,720 + 2,801 (offset) = 5,521.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: True pipeline is 2,120 units (P44, P45); system 'In-transit' of 4,921 is inflated by 2,801 units of confirmed lost stock. P44 shipment is now 1 period overdue beyond expected L=2.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 Decision: The system currently reports 5,648 units In-transit. Based on the carry-over history, 2,801 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37). Additionally, the P44 order (1,172 units) is now 5 periods old and the P45 order (948 units) is 4 periods old; with an established L=2, these are effectively confirmed lost, adding 2,120 units to the lost total. Total lost units in pipeline = 2,801 + 2,120 = 4,921. True pipeline = 5,648 - 4,921 = 727 units (the P48 order). Demand has been volatile but significant. Mean demand over the last 15 periods (approx. P34-P48) is ~164 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of this forecast, while using L=2 as the stable lead time for the backend. Because on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is mostly phantom inventory, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account only for the true pipeline (727 units) plus safety stock. Since this is the penultimate period (P49 of 50), I want to ensure enough stock for the final period without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Shipments from P44 (1,172 units) and P45 (948 units) are confirmed lost (5 and 4 periods elapsed respectively, L=2 established). Total confirmed lost inventory in system pipeline is now 4,921 units. True pipeline consists only of the P48 order (727 units).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 50, 'On-hand' is 0 and system 'In-transit' is 5648 units. However, based on lead-time analysis (L=2) and historical tracking, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37, P44, and P45 are confirmed or effectively lost due to excessive delays. The total lost volume is 4921 units. The true pipeline consists only of the P48 order (727 units). This creates a massive stockout risk. Demand has shown high volatility; the last 15 periods (P35-P49) average 147 units/period, but excluding periods with zero demand (likely reporting artifacts or complete stockouts), the active demand average is closer to 180-200. I set L=2 based on recent successful deliveries (P34, P35, P39). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture recent volatility while acknowledging the intermittent demand pattern. sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme supply-side risk (frequent lost orders) and demand spikes, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to recover from the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Total confirmed lost inventory in the system pipeline remains 4,921 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P25, P30, P37, P44, P45). System 'In-transit' (5,648) = True Pipeline (727 from P48) + Lost (4,921). Supply reliability is extremely low, with a failure rate >50% for all orders placed after P30.
