Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. There is no historical context or prior performance to evaluate. I have demand data for five periods (75, 90, 0, 170, 127). The mean demand is 92.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 63.8. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend needs parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Given the high variability (std=63.8) and the zero-demand outlier in period 3, I will use 'default' methods to allow the engine to establish a baseline using all available samples. My goal in P1 is to initiate the pipeline since current on-hand is 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 197 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this to arrive in the 'Period 2 conclude' message (visible at the start of Period 3). Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand is [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with Period 1 demand being 132. The mean of all historical samples (including Period 1) is (75+90+0+170+127+132)/6 = 99. Given the promised lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out the outlier (Period 3: 0). Period 1 demand was higher than the historical average, so recent_N=5 will capture this better than the total average.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 132 and 100 (average ~116). However, the demand history provided in the prompt (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) contradicts the 'Game History' observations (132, 100). I will prioritize the 'Game History' as it represents the actual engine's execution. Both orders from Period 1 (197 units) and Period 2 (211 units) are in transit. Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. Since L=2, the base stock must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Mean demand is approx 116. Using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the most recent actual performance while acknowledging the high variance (132 vs 100). The pipeline (408) currently exceeds the expected demand for 3 periods (3 * 116 = 348), but because we started at 0 and have already missed demand, the OR engine needs to maintain this stock level to recover.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (197 units), Period 2 (211 units), and Period 3 (5 units). Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order (placed in Period 1) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which I am reading now at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests the actual lead time is likely at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales due to stockouts. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) and game history (132, 100, 80) show significant volatility. Period 4 demand (170) and Period 5 (127) were provided in the prompt's historical demand data but not yet 'concluded' in the game history, suggesting a mean demand around 100-110 units. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay seen from the Period 1 order, and use the recent 5 samples for demand to capture recent levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3838.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a promised lead time of 2, but actual lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (Period 4). The order from Period 2 (211 units) is currently in Period 3 of transit (exceeding promised L=2) and should ideally arrive in Period 5. Demand samples show significant variance: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 (mean ~92). However, recent periods 4 and 5 (from user-provided data) show higher demands of 170 and 127 compared to the initial start. Given the stockout in Period 4 (sold 202 vs demand 221), I need to stabilize the inventory. I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to account for the observed delay from Period 1 and the pending Period 2 shipment. I'll use recent_N (N=4) for demand estimation to capture the recent higher activity while smoothing for the zero in Period 3.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory and 626 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3's small order arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2's order (211 units) is now overdue (ordered P2, should have arrived P4 or P5), suggesting either a delay or potential loss. Demand history is volatile (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 from samples; 132, 100, 80, 221, 70 from game history). The average demand across all 5 completed periods in game history is 120.6. Given the stockout situation (ending inventory 0 for 5 consecutive periods) and lead time instability, I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the jitter, and 'default' for mu/sigma to use all available samples to stabilize the forecast, as no clear regime shift is yet sustained.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 626 units in-transit. Historical demand shows significant volatility (samples range from 0 to 221). In Period 4, we saw arrivals from Period 1 (LT=3) and Period 3 (LT=1), suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is an average but actual lead times fluctuate. Orders from Period 2 (211 units), Period 4 (179 units), and Period 5 (236 units) are currently in-transit. Given the stockout for the last two periods, we need to stabilize the inventory position. Demand excluding the outlier in Period 3 (0) and Period 4 (221) averages around 90-110 units. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the OR backend to incorporate the observed variability, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to cover all history, capturing the high variance to ensure the base stock levels are sufficiently protective.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 173 units on-hand and 462 units in-transit. A review of the delivery history shows that the promised lead time of 2 periods is inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1), and Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (L=3). The average observed lead time is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Period 2 (211 units) and Period 5 (236 units) orders are still in transit and technically overdue or at the limit. Demand has been volatile (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 from samples; 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6 from conclude messages). The most recent demand in Period 7 was exceptionally low (6 units), but previous periods suggest a higher average. Given the lead time variability (L=3 seen twice), I will set L to 3 to be safe. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the last 4 periods (221, 70, 72, 6) is 92.25. Including Period 4's spike might be risky if it was an outlier, but standardizing for L=3, the backend needs (1+L) * mean. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent regime which encompasses the high and low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is volatile and often exceeds promised (observed L=3 in 2 out of 3 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2116.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 297 units following a demand of 127 in Period 8. Analyzing the lead time history: observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. This confirms the lead time is volatile and often exceeds the promised 2 periods, with a mode of 3. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the OR backend to account for this longer cycle. Demand has been highly variable, ranging from 6 to 221. The last 4 periods show 70, 72, 6, and 127 (mean ~68.75), while the full history mean is ~101. Given the recent spike following a very low period, there isn't a clear confirmed regime shift yet, so I will use a broader window (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance and avoid overreacting to the recent low-demand cluster. With high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the service level target (95%) is high, so maintaining a larger safety stock via sigma_hat is preferred.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived at P4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived at P4 (L=1), Period 4 arrived at P7 (L=3), Period 5 arrived at P8 (L=3), and Period 7 arrived at P8 (L=1). The mode is L=3, which is 1 period longer than the promised L=2. I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the realistic delay. Demand history shows significant volatility (samples: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 in instruction; 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6, 127, 3 in history). The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 90. Applying recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat will capture this average. Given the high variance (standard deviation), I will use default sigma_hat calculation over all samples to provide a sufficient safety buffer. On-hand is 294, and in-transit is 313 (likely the P2 order of 211 and P9 order of 102). Setting L=3 increases the base stock target, accounting for the longer delivery cycle.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant volatility (L=3 for P1, P4, and P5; L=1 for P3 and P7). The average lead time observed across these 5 arrivals is 2.2. Given that 'In-transit' currently stands at 313 units (likely covering the orders from P2 and P9), and on-hand inventory is 222 units, the system is relatively well-stocked against current demand. However, the lead-time variability necessitates a slightly higher safety stock. Demand has been highly erratic, ranging from 3 to 221. Since Period 4, demand has mostly hovered at lower levels except for P8 and P10. Using 'calculate' for L will factor in the observed delays, while using a recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) accounts for the recent average of ~56 units/period, which is lower than the initial periods.

In Period 12, we observe that demand has been highly variable, with a significant spike of 209 units in Period 11, following several periods of low demand. Looking at arrival history, the actual lead time has frequently stabilized around 3 periods (Periods 1, 4, and 5 orders all took 3 periods), though shorter lead times occur. Currently, we have 13 units on-hand and 313 units in-transit (reflecting the Period 2 order of 211 and Period 9 order of 102). The Period 2 order is now 10 periods old, which strongly suggests it is lost. If we discount the 211 units from Period 2, our actual pipeline is only 102 units. To prevent stockouts against volatile demand (mean ~90, but peaks >200), I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and using recent_N for demand to capture the recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 2 (211 units) is 10 periods old and likely lost, as L=3 is the observed maximum for successful deliveries.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Recent demand has been highly variable, with a significant spike of 209 units in Period 11 and 85 in Period 12. The order from Period 2 (211 units) is now 11 periods old and confirmed lost, which the CARRY-OVER insights correctly identified. Observed successful lead times (excluding lost ones) are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3], averaging 2.33 periods. Since the promised lead time is 2 but 3 is common, I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the mean of the 12 observed samples is (132+100+80+221+70+72+6+127+3+72+209+85)/12 = 98.08. Given the high variance and recent volatility, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the more current demand regime while smoothing out the extreme 3-unit and 209-unit outliers. This balance helps maintain a sufficient base stock without excessive holding costs, especially since on-hand inventory is low (30) and the pipeline (438) includes the recently placed Period 12 order.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory and 510 units in-transit. Historical lead times have consistently been longer than the promised 2 periods (mostly 3 periods: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12). The order from Period 2 (211 units) is now 12 periods old and is confirmed lost based on the 'Carry-over Insight'. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 510 - 211 = 299 units (orders from P12 and P13). Demand is volatile with significant spikes (e.g., P4: 221, P11: 209, P13: 166). To protect against the stockout currently occurring and the observed L=3 lead time, I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the recent high-demand variance and shift (P9-P13), which averages ~107 units/period, compared to the earlier average which was lower. This ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows actual lead times (L) are frequently 3 periods (Periods 4, 7, 8, 12 conclude messages show 3-period arrivals), despite the promised L=2. In-transit inventory includes orders from Period 12 (expected Period 15), Period 13 (expected Period 16), and Period 14 (expected Period 17). The order from Period 2 (211 units) is now 13 periods old and definitively lost. Demand is highly volatile (ranging from 0 to 221), so I will use a conservative lead time of 3 to calculate the base stock. I will use the last 5 samples of demand to capture the recent mean and variance, which accounts for the most recent high-demand periods (P11-P13) while balancing the 0-demand periods observed in P14.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Order from Period 2 is lost and should be excluded from pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2153.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 108 units on hand and 470 in transit. The in-transit inventory consists of: P13 (72 units), P14 (186 units), P15 (1 unit), and critically, the likely lost order from P2 (211 units). The carry-over insights confirm that the P2 order is lost, but the OR backend doesn't know this and will treat it as valid pipeline inventory, leading to under-ordering. To correct for this, I must set 'explicit' parameters that account for the 'phantom' 211 units. The observed lead time is consistently L=3 (confirmed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P15). Demand has been volatile: the last 5 samples are [85, 166, 0, 119, ?] (P15 demand was 119). Excluding the outlier P14 (0 demand), the recent mean is approximately 110. With L=3, mu_hat (1+L) should be 4 * 110 = 440. However, to bypass the backend's deduction of the 211 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat to 440 + 211 = 651. This ensures the base stock calculation targets a physical inventory of 440 after the backend subtracts the full pipeline. I set L to 3 and sigma_hat to an explicit value reflecting recent volatility (approx 50 per period * sqrt(4)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3420.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be highly variable, with recent demand at 185 units leading to a stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline of 652 units is heavily skewed by the 211 units from Period 2, which are confirmed lost. Adjusting for this, the actual pipeline is 441 units (Periods 14, 15, and 16). Historical arrival data confirms a physical lead time (L) of 3 periods (observed in most successful deliveries). Therefore, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the upward trend observed in Periods 13, 15, and 16, which will help prevent the recurring stockouts seen recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5500.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 143 units on hand. The Carry-over Insights confirm that the order from Period 2 (211 units) is lost and should be discounted from the pipeline. The effective 'In-transit' is 35 units (34 units from P17 and 1 unit from P15). Lead times have consistently shown a pattern of either 1 or 3 periods (average 2.4 across samples), so setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR engine to account for this variability above the promised 2. Demand has shown high volatility recently (P17 reached 297), compared to the earlier periods. To capture this recent move toward higher demand while smoothing out the zero/low values, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 11-17). This N captures the current higher demand regime (avg ~148) which is significantly higher than the overall average.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we have 85 units on-hand and 554 in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', the 211 units ordered in Period 2 are definitively lost and must be excluded from pipeline considerations. The adjusted in-transit total is 343 units (554 - 211). Historical lead times show high variance, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13, P14 concluded with L=3, while P3, P7, P16 concluded with L=1). Using L=3 is safer to ensure availability. Demand has shown high volatility recently (P17 reached 297), so I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. Setting L to 3 explicitly better reflects the modal observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1435.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio. On-hand inventory is low (9 units) after consistent sales. Current in-transit inventory is 755 units, but history confirms that the Period 2 order (211 units) is lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 544 units (total in-transit 755 - lost 211). Historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most frequent for successful arrivals lately. I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the realistic replenishment delay. Demand is volatile with a recent mean around 125 units (last 5 periods: 185, 297, 58, 76, plus the current period's projected impact). I'll use a recent window (N=8) to capture this volatility while stabilizing the mean against outliers. Using L=3 and recent_N for both mu and sigma will allow the backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time and recent demand swings, helping to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the SKU chips(Regular) has 0 on-hand inventory following a high-demand period (420 units in Period 20). Total in-transit inventory is 786 units. Based on historical data, the order from Period 2 (211 units) is permanently lost and should be excluded from pipeline calculations, leaving 575 units (786 - 211) of viable pipeline inventory (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). Observed lead times have been volatile, peaking at 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13, P14). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for this longer arrival window. Demand has shown significant variability; although the mean of all samples is ~127, several spikes exceed 200, including the recent 420. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (covering periods since the mean shifted slightly higher in the mid-cycle) to normalize the forecast against recent volatility while ensuring the base stock level is robust enough to cover the lead time (L+1=4 periods). Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' (N=9) to capture the increased variance observed in the most recent demand cycles.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent spikes (Period 20: 420 units, Period 21: 263 units). Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 157. However, there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 1056 units. This includes orders from Period 18 (308), Period 19 (201), Period 20 (31), and Period 21 (270), plus the declared lost order from Period 2 (211). Excluding the lost P2 order, the active pipeline is 845 units. Given that the typical lead time is 3 periods (calculated L=3 from history), the orders from Period 18 and 19 should arrive in Periods 21 and 22, but have not yet 'concluded' in my view. I expect a massive arrival in the next few periods. Increasing mu_hat using recent_N=5 (average ~207) to account for the current high-demand regime, while using L=3 to match observed lead times. This will help the OR backend recognize that the current pipeline (845 active units) is likely sufficient relative to the base stock calculation, preventing excessive over-ordering while awaiting the delayed shipments.

Critically, there is a massive backlog in the pipeline (1398 units) due to no arrivals in Periods 18-22, despite substantial orders placed in Periods 18 (308), 19 (201), 20 (31), 21 (270), and 22 (342). While the Period 2 order (211 units) is officially considered lost, the remaining in-transit stock is extremely high. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is fluctuating upward, I must set the lead time term (L) to 3 to reflect the consistent actual delay. I will use a recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand variance and mean (including the 420 unit spike) while relying on the pipeline to fulfill requirements, as the backend OR policy will subtract the 1398 units in-transit (minus the 211 lost units) from the calculated base stock. Explicitly setting L=3 helps prioritize a higher base stock to cover the longer lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged logistics disruption: No arrivals observed for 5 consecutive periods (Periods 18-22) despite high in-transit volume (1398 units). Actual lead time remains consolidated at L=3 for successful deliveries.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent disruption in logistics has resolved as of Period 23, where arrivals from Periods 20, 21, and 22 occurred simultaneously. This confirms a lead time of roughly 1-3 periods, with an average closer to L=3 for planning safety. The current on-hand inventory is 442. Regarding in-transit: the carry-over insight correctly identifies the Period 2 order (211 units) as lost. Total reported in-transit is 755; subtracting the lost 211 units leaves an effective pipeline of 544 units (from orders in Period 18 and 19). The demand regime has shifted upwards starting around Period 17; the mean of the last 7 samples (including Period 23) is approximately 209. To account for this higher recent demand and ensure sufficient stock against lead-time volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 and sigma_hat with recent_N=7 to capture the increased variance observed in this higher-demand regime. L is set to explicit 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed reliable lead time plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Logistics disruption resolved in Period 23 with a cluster of arrivals; lead time remains variable (1-3 periods). Demand regime shift confirmed from Period 17, with average demand increasing from ~100 to ~210 (+110%).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 17 (average ~210 vs previous ~100) is well-established. Over the last 8 periods (17-24), the mean demand is 202.1 units. In-transit arrivals recently normalized with a large cluster in Period 23, resolving a multi-period disruption. Calculated lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most frequent result for scheduled arrivals (mode/max). The on-hand inventory is 317, and the in-transit balance is 825. Note that the Period 2 order (211 units) is officially considered lost (as noted in CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS), meaning the adjusted pipeline is 614 units (825 - 211). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent logistics delays, and use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated consumption and protects against lead time variability.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, with average demand increasing significantly. I will use a recent_N of 9 (Periods 17-25) to capture this higher mean (approx 205) and variance, which reflects the new normal better than the full history. Regarding lead time, while the promised L=2, historical observations show a maximum L=3. I will explicitly set L=3 to account for this historical latency and the risk of late arrivals. The order from Period 2 (211 units) is decades past due and definitively lost; it is excluded from pipeline integrity. Pipeline inventory currently consists of orders from P18 (308), P19 (201), P24 (70), and P25 (64) totaling 643 units (after subtracting the lost 211 units and accounting for arrivals up to P25). My parameters (L=3, mu_hat based on 205 mean * 4 periods) aim to maintain sufficient stock for the lead time plus current period while preventing overstocking given the current on-hand of 282.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1878.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, with average demand increasing to approximately 210 units per period. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows high volatility, including spikes over 400 and lows near 35. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods). We must maintain a robust stock level to cover refined demand and logistics uncertainty. Current on-hand inventory is 174, with 889 units in-transit. It is critical to exclude the lost order from Period 2 (211 units) in the pipeline calculation; however, since the OR backend automatically subtracts 'pipeline_inventory', and the system currently reports 889 in-transit, we need to ensure our mu_hat (target base stock) is sufficiently high to trigger orders if needed. Given current on-hand/in-transit and the 110% increase in demand mean, I am using recent_N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and setting L=3 to account for the observed maximum lead time for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3306.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) after Period 27 ending inventory was exhausted by high demand (207 units). Historical data confirms a demand regime shift started around Period 17, where demand increased to an average of ~210 units. However, recent periods (24-27) show high volatility with alternating low-high demand (125, 35, 108, 207). Lead times are highly variable, with successes observed at 1, 2, and 3 periods, though a major disruption occurred recently where no units arrived for 5 periods. The in-transit pipeline (928 units) is dominated by an old missing shipment from Period 2 (211 units) which is confirmed lost. Subtracting the lost units, the effective pipeline is 717 units. Orders from Period 18 and 19 (308 + 201 units) are now 9-10 periods delayed, suggesting another possible sector of logistics loss or severe delay. I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of successful delivery times and use recent_N (N=11) to capture the higher demand regime from Period 17 onwards, ensuring the base stock level targets the elevated mean while the OR engine manages the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Potential new logistics failure; orders from Period 18 and 19 (509 units total) are significantly overdue (>7 periods) and may be lost, similar to the Period 2 event.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29. The demand regime shifted around Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 210 units per period. The recent samples (Periods 18-28) show high volatility but sustain this higher mean. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have a high In-transit volume of 1094 units. However, consistent with the Period 28 insight, the orders from Period 18 (308 units) and Period 19 (201 units) are now 10-11 periods old. Given that the maximum successful lead time observed in this environment is 3 periods, these 509 units are highly likely lost and will never arrive. Additionally, orders from Periods 20, 21, and 22 arrived in Period 23, but nothing from Periods 24-27 has arrived yet. This suggests a recurring logistics failure or extended lead time drift. To account for the likely lost orders (509 units) and the ongoing delay, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using recent_N with N=12 to capture the higher mean and variance of the new regime (starting P17). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=12 to properly account for the increased volatility in this regime, which protects against stockouts during arrival gaps.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Persistent logistics failure confirmed; orders from Period 18 and 19 (509 units) are 10+ periods old and definitely lost. In-transit reporting is inflated by these 'ghost' units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the on-hand inventory is 0. Total units in-transit are reported as 1055, but this includes 'ghost' units from lost shipments (Period 2: 211 units; Period 18: 308 units; Period 19: 201 units), totaling 720 lost units. The actual effective pipeline inventory is 1055 - 720 = 335 units. Demand since Period 17 has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 190-210 units per period. Lead times for successful deliveries continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods, making L=3 a prudent choice for calculating base stock. I will set L=3 explicitly to reflect the maximum observed reliable lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the regime shift at Period 17) to capture this higher mean demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=13) to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed loss of orders from Periods 18 and 19 (509 units total), which are now 11+ periods old. Effective pipeline is 720 units lower than the system-reported 'In-transit' value due to three distinct lost shipment events (P2, P18, P19).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, inventory is critical (On-hand: 0). The demand regime remains high (Period 17-30 average ~205). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 894 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. Based on Carry-over Insights (P2, P18, P19), 720 units (211 + 308 + 201) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 174 units (894 - 720), which consists of orders from P24 (70), P25 (64), P30 (5), and any unrecorded arrivals from P29. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times range from 1 to 3. I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient coverage for the current demand spike (P30 demand was 305). Using recent_N for mu_hat based on the Period 17 regime shift (last 14 samples), I am attempting to force an order that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory the OR backend erroneously thinks is coming.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 32, we are dealing with high demand volatility and significant logistics disruptions. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 1101 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' units from lost shipments in Period 2 (211 units), Period 18 (308 units), and Period 19 (201 units), totaling 720 units. These orders are now 13+ periods old while the maximum observed lead time for successful delivery is 3 periods. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 381 units (1101 - 720). Demand significantly increased starting around Period 17; the average demand in the last 15 periods (recent_N=15) is approximately 197 units, compared to the early average of ~100. Due to recent spikes (e.g., 509 in Period 31), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture this higher mean while using explicit sigma_hat set to a higher value (120) to maintain a higher service level given the stockouts and logistics risk. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) because, although the promised lead time is 2, the successful delivery lead time is frequently 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Significant demand spike to 509 units observed; context suggests high volatility in the current high-demand regime (starting P17). Effective pipeline reconciliation: 720 units of 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19) and must be ignored for ordering decisions.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 210 units and higher volatility (notably the 509 units in P31). Total in-transit is reported at 894, but 720 units (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201) are confirmed lost based on reaching a lead time of 13+ periods when successful deliveries arrive in 1-3 periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of 174 units. Current on-hand is 198. Total effective inventory is 372. To cover the lead time (L=3 based on calculate/recent history) plus the current period (L+1=4), we target a base stock based on the high-demand regime (Period 17-32, excluding outliers or using recent averages). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observations and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 (from P17 onwards) to capture the higher mean demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=16 to account for the increased variance in this regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 17, with average demand increasing significantly to approximately 210 units/period (vs. ~100 units/period previously), though volatility is high (recent peak of 509 in Period 31). Logistics remain unstable: three major orders from Period 2 (211 units), Period 18 (308 units), and Period 19 (201 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 720 'ghost' units in the system-reported 'In-transit' figure of 1024. The true effective pipeline is 1024 - 720 = 304 units (consisting of orders from Period 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, and 33). Current on-hand is 107. Since the OR backend cannot filter lost orders, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the inflated pipeline. I set L=3 based on the observed maximum lead time for successful deliveries during disruptions. I set mu_hat to (1+3) * 210 = 840 to match the new demand regime. For sigma_hat, I use a high explicit estimate (sqrt(1+3) * 125 = 250) to account for the high volatility (standard deviation since P17 is ~125).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, with average demand increasing significantly (~210 vs ~100 previously) and showing high volatility (spikes up to 509). I will use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-variance state. Current on-hand inventory is 0. System reports 1145 units in transit, but 720 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 211, Period 18: 308, Period 19: 201). This leaves an effective pipeline of 425 units. The OR backend uses (In-transit) in its calculation, but since I cannot manually subtract the 'ghost' units from that field, the backend will underestimate the required order. To compensate, I set L=explicit (value 5) to extend the look-ahead window and force a higher base stock, and I use an explicit mu_hat calculated as (5+1) * 215 = 1290 to ensure the policy triggers an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Effective pipeline reconciliation: 720 units of 'In-transit' are permanently lost (P2, P18, P19) and will never arrive. The 'In-transit' field is consistently inflated by this amount.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 17, with average demand increasing significantly. The current high-demand regime (Periods 17-35) shows an average demand of approximately 213 units, though it is highly volatile (ranging from 9 to 509). The logistics situation is the primary concern: there are 721 units currently calculated as 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (Period 2: 211 units, Period 18: 308 units, Period 19: 201 units). The system-reported 'In-transit' of 1593 units therefore contains only 872 units of viable pipeline inventory. With 0 on-hand inventory and a confirmed lead time (L) of 3 periods, we must set parameters to cover the 4-period demand horizon (L+1). A mu_hat based on the recent regime (N=19) is appropriate to capture the higher mean, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to handle the extreme volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 138) observed since Period 17. The OR backend's order calculation will subtract the (inflated) pipeline; however, the 'cap' mechanism and the high sigma_hat should help trigger sufficient ordering despite the 'ghost' units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed lost shipments: 720 units (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201). These 'ghost' units permanently inflate the 'In-transit' figure and should be ignored when assessing stock-out risk. High-demand regime (since P17) average is 213 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 1472. However, based on sustained observations from Periods 12, 15, 28, 29, 30, 35, and 36, exactly 720 units (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201) are confirmed lost shipments. These 'ghost' units will never arrive and must be excluded from pipeline calculations. The effective in-transit inventory is actually 752 units (1472 - 720). Since Period 17, we have entered a high-demand regime with an average demand of 213 units and significant volatility (std dev ~140). Recent logistics performance shows lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability in the current period and the lead-time window, the combined on-hand and pipeline inventory must support (L+1) periods of demand. With effective pipeline at 752 and high-demand regime requirements, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=20, covering the start of the regime shift at P17) and lead time L as 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability and the impact of recent arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 17, with average demand increasing to approximately 213 units. Recent demand has been volatile (ranging from 9 to 509). The current on-hand inventory is 348. The 'In-transit' figure of 1024 includes 720 units from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 18, and 19), meaning the effective pipeline is only 304 units (1024 - 720). Cumulative inventory (on-hand 348 + effective pipeline 304 = 652 units) is below the required level for a 3-period lead-time window (L+1 = 3), which at an average of 213 units/period would require roughly 639 units as a base, not accounting for the high volatility (sigma). Given the significant stock-out risks seen in recent history and the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime characteristics while smoothing the recent 509-unit spike. L is set to 'calculate' to benefit from the backend's internal tracking of actual observed lead times (averaging around 2-3).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 213 units per period and significant volatility (peaks over 500). Logistics remains the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' figure of 1024 units is misleading because 720 units are confirmed lost from Periods 2, 18, and 19. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 304 units (1024 - 720). With on-hand inventory at 22 units, the total effective stock available to cover upcoming periods is 326 units. Given the high-demand average of ~213 and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, we need to ensure the system places an order to bridge the gap. By using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=22 (covering the high-demand regime from P17 to P38), we capture the current high mean (~213). For sigma_hat, N=22 will also reflect the recent high volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to use the observed lead time average, which acknowledges the shift from the promised 2 periods to the actual behavior.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 17, with average demand increasing to approximately 213 units per period. Recent volatility is high (standard deviation approx 130). Logistics remain unstable; there are 720 units confirmed lost (Period 2, 18, and 19) which permanently inflate the reported In-transit figure. Current reported In-transit is 1175, but the effective pipeline is only 455 (1175 - 720). On-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend does not know about the 720 lost units, it under-orders because it thinks the pipeline is full. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to force an order that covers the effective deficit. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to (1+L)*350 (higher than regime mean to offset the 720-unit 'ghost' inventory), and sigma_hat to an explicit value that accounts for recent high demand variance (spike to 509).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime since Period 17 continues, with a mean of approximately 213 units. The current state shows 19 units on-hand and 1,311 units in-transit. However, based on confirmed carry-over insights, 720 units in-transit are permanently lost (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 1,311 - 720 = 591 units. Since Period 17, the lead time has stabilized between 1-3 periods, so I will continue using an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. For demand (mu_hat), recent_N with N=24 captures the entire high-demand regime from Period 17 to Period 40. This approach accounts for the missing 720 units and maintains a buffer against the high volatility (e.g., P31 demand of 509) observed in the current regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 remains active, characterized by an average demand of approximately 213 units and high volatility. Recent demand (P31-P41) shows spikes up to 509 units, while Period 41 demand was 296, confirming the need for a robust base stock. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' figure of 1311 units. However, as documented in provide carry-over insights, 720 units from Periods 2, 18, and 19 are definitively lost. Additionally, the order from Period 33 (130 units) is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the total 'ghost' units to 850. The effective pipeline is therefore 1311 - 850 = 461 units (primary components being P35, P39, P40 orders). Given the high demand and the risk of further fulfillment failures, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20 to cover the current high-demand regime) to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order that accounts for both the high mean and the significant variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Order from Period 33 (130 units) is 9 periods old and confirmed lost (L=3 is the successful delivery limit); total lost units inflating In-transit is now 850 (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201, P33: 130).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (since Period 17) has an average demand of approximately 213 units. In Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit value of 1311 units is heavily inflated by 850 confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201, P33: 130). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 461 units (consisting of the P40 order of 287 units). Since actual lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods, a base stock needs to cover at least (L+1) periods. Using L=3 for safety, and an explicit mu_hat reflecting the high-demand regime, ensures the system generates an order to replenish the exhausted on-hand stock and account for the significant pipeline deficit created by the recent losses.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 44 shows an on-hand inventory of 270 units following a demand drop in Period 43 (17 units). Significant logistics issues persist: total 'In-transit' is 1024, but 850 of these are confirmed lost (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201, P33: 130). Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 174 units (1024 - 850). The high-demand regime since Period 17 continues with high volatility (mean ~213). Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=27, covering the high-demand regime since P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this volatility. For lead time, I'll use L=3 to account for the frequent observed delays and the current logistics unreliability, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock for 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 50. The current date is Period_45. The high-demand regime (starting Period 17) continues, with an average demand of approximately 213 units per period and significant volatility (recent spike to 509 in Period 31). Logistics remain unreliable: lead times vary between 1-3 periods, and multiple shipments have been permanently lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (211), P18 (308), P19 (201), and P33 (130) are confirmed lost, totaling 850 units. These 'ghost units' permanently inflate the system-reported 'In-transit' of 1024 units. The effective pipeline is actually 174 units (1024 - 850). On-hand inventory is 106. With an effective total stock of 280 units (106 + 174) and average high-regime demand around 210, we are below the required (L+1) coverage for a 3-period lead time window. I will set L to 3 (observed maximum for successful delivery) to be conservative and use recent_N (N=28, starting from P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility demand regime while ignoring the lost units in the logic.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that began at Period 17, with significant volatility. The mean demand for this regime (P17-P45) is approximately 211 units per period. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1024 units; however, a total of 850 units represent 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201, P33: 130). Effectively, the pipeline inventory is only 174 units (1024 - 850). Since On-hand is 0, we are at high risk of a stock-out given the high demand. I will use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's faulty pipeline calculation. I set L=3 based on the maximum observed successful lead time. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*211 = 844 to cover the high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility (seen in spikes like 509 demand units). By setting L=3, mu_hat=844, and sigma_hat=250, I aim to trigger an order that compensates for the lost 850 units and covers the upcoming 4 periods of demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 remains active, characterized by a mean of approximately 213 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~127). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system-reported In-transit is 1256 units, but 850 units are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19, P33) based on historical lead time trends where successful deliveries never exceed 3 periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of 406 units (1256 - 850). Specifically, this real pipeline consists of the P46 order (232 units) and an older order, likely from P40 which already arrived, or reflecting a lag in reporting. Given the high criticality of stock-outs (Profit/Holding = 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 30 periods to capture this high-demand regime. Lead time L is set to explicit '3' to account for the frequent logistics delays observed beyond the promised 2 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Demand context: Since Period 17, we have been in a high-demand regime with an average of approximately 213 units per period, though recently it has been volatile (ranging from 0 to 509). Lead time analysis: Observed lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 3 periods, but several shipments have been confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19, P33). Effective Pipeline Calculation: Total In-transit is reported as 1256. However, 850 units are confirmed lost (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201, P33: 130). Thus, the effective pipeline is 1256 - 850 = 406 units. These 406 units correspond to orders from Period 46 (232 units) and likely any other recent active orders. On-hand is 0. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), we must ensure enough stock arrives to cover the final window. I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering in the final stages. mu_hat is set to 213 (regime average) * (1+L) = 639. sigma_hat is calculated using the high-demand regime data (~31 samples since P17).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The high-demand regime starting from P17 remains the relevant baseline, with an average demand of approximately 213 units. Total confirmed lost shipments are 850 units (P2: 211, P18: 308, P19: 201, P33: 130). Current 'In-transit' is 1256, but subtracting the 850 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 406 units. This 406 units likely comprises orders from more recent periods (like P46: 232 units), which are still within the observed max lead time (L=3). On-hand inventory is 0. Since the game ends after Period 50, an order placed now in P49 with a lead time of 1-3 periods is likely to arrive either in P50 (the final demand period) or after the game concludes. To maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory, I'll set parameters to maintain the current high-demand mean, using recent_N (N=33 for P17-P49) to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the risk of lost shipments. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variance (1-3 periods).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 50. On-hand inventory is 0. System-reported In-transit is 1256 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights from Period 42, 850 units are confirmed lost (P2, P18, P19, P33). Effective Pipeline = 1256 - 850 = 406 units. These 406 units represent recent orders (e.g., P46 232 units) that have not yet arrived. The demand regime since P17 averages ~210 units/period with high volatility (observed range 0 to 509). Lead times are unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with L=3 being the safe upper bound for successful delivery. I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers the extended lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 33 (spanning from P17 to P49) to capture the high-demand regime average of ~210. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the high volatility (sigma \u2248 130). This approach balances the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory that would otherwise prevent the OR engine from ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Effective pipeline reconciliation remains critical. The 'In-transit' figure of 1256 is inflated by 850 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P18, P19, P33). Demand since P17 remains in a high-volatility regime averaging ~210 units/period.
