Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (seeds) are: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127. The mean of these samples is 92.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 57.3. Since this is the first period of data generation, there is no 'conclude' message to analyze for actual lead time shifts. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the full seed history, and stick with the default promised lead time (L=2). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers 3 periods of expected demand (L+1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 197 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. We are now in Period 2. The Period 1 conclude message shows demand was 79 but sales were 0 because on-hand inventory was 0 (starting inventory was 0 and the order hasn't arrived yet). The order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive in Period 3 (L=2). Currently, pipeline inventory is 197. Demand history shows 5 samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) with an average of 92.4. However, Period 1 demand in the game history was 79. Given the early stage and lack of conclusive evidence for a regime shift from the provided samples, I will use the default methods which utilize all available historical data. Since the system calculates base stock for (1+L) periods, and we are currently at 0 inventory with 197 in transit, the backend will determine if additional units are needed to cover the lead time. No anomalies in lead time are present yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and I have 354 units in transit (197 from P1, 157 from P2). Demand history shows [75, 90, 0, 170, 127] as samples, but the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 provide the actual demand experienced during the simulation: P1=79, P2=114. Average demand is approx 96.5. Since the promised lead time is 2, I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. The OR backend uses mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_demand. I will use the default methods as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or a sustained demand regime shift, and the sample size is small.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution, which becomes visible at the start of Period 4. However, the history log for 'Period 3 conclude' shows 'arrived=0', which is highly concerning. If the lead time were truly 2, Period 1's order should have concluded in the Period 3 report. This suggests either a longer lead time (L=3+) or a lost shipment. Additionally, demand is rapidly increasing (79 -> 114 -> 164), roughly +50% per period. With 0 on-hand inventory and 358 units in-transit (P1: 197, P2: 157, P3: 4), we are currently experiencing stockouts. I will adjust L to 3 to reflect the delay and use an EWMA for mu_hat to capture the steep demand trend while maintaining a higher sigma to buffer against the high variance and delivery uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (197 units) after a 3-period lead time and the Period 3 order (4 units) after a 1-period lead time. This indicates lead time variability relative to the promised 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 114, and in-transit is 350. Historical demand shows a significant shift: P1 (75/79), P2 (90/114), P3 (0/164), P4 (170/87), P5 (127). Looking at the 'demand' field in the 'conclude' logs (79, 114, 164, 87), there is high volatility. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target the 80th percentile of demand. To account for lead-time instability and recent demand patterns, I will use lead time 'calculate' to incorporate observed actuals and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the latest volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, looking at the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (actual L=1). Period 2's order of 157 units is still in-transit and overdue (ordered P2, should have arrived P4 or P5). Period 5 also resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Demand is showing high volatility: P1-P5 demand was [79, 114, 164, 87, 122], with an average of 113.2 units per period. Because we are currently stocked out and have an overdue order plus a high in-transit balance (395 units), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (1 and 3). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=5) to capture the high variance and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current delivery instability.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been consistent with a mean of approximately 115 units. Historical arrivals show variability: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is an average but unstable. Currently, 510 units are in transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). P2's order of 157 units is now overdue (placed P2, expected P4/P5, current is P7). To ensure coverage for the lead time plus current period (L+1=3), I will use the recent mean demand (excluding the zero outlier in the prompt history, but the conclude messages show 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127). The average demand from conclude messages is ~115. Setting L to the calculates average to reflect lead-time volatility. Setting mu_hat to 345 (115 * 3) using 'recent_N' to capture the slightly increasing demand trend seen in late periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 114 units on-hand and 345 units in-transit. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2. Actual lead times observed are 3 periods (P1 ordered, arrived P4), 1 period (P3 ordered, arrived P4), and 3 periods (P4 ordered, arrived P7). The orders from P2 (157 units), P5 (45 units), and P6 (115 units) are still in-transit. Specifically, P2's order is significantly overdue (6 periods since order), suggesting it might be lost. P5 and P6 are within the window of the observed variable lead time. Demand history: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 (from setup samples) and 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79 (from history). Average demand is approx 103 units/period. The pipeline inventory (345) looks high, but if the P2 order (157) is lost, effective in-transit is only 188. To handle the lead time volatility and potential loss, I will use an explicit L of 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and recent_N for demand to capture recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is volatile, frequently observed as 3 periods instead of the promised 2. Shipment from Period 2 (157 units) is likely lost as it is 6 periods old.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 77 and 334 units in-transit. Analysis of past arrivals confirms that the actual lead time is frequently 3 periods (Period 1 arrived in P4, Period 4 in P7, Period 5 in P8), despite a promised lead time of 2. We have two very early arrivals (lead time 1), but the modal lead time is 3. The shipment from Period 2 (157 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost; this shipment should be excluded from pipeline calculations. The in-transit total of 334 units includes: P2 (157 - lost), P6 (115), and P8 (62). Removing the lost P2 units, the 'effective' in-transit is 177 units. Demand has been fluctuating between 79 and 164, with a recent 5-period average of approximately 105. I will set L to 3 to account for the consistent delivery delays and use the last 5 samples (N=5) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, which includes a zero-demand outlier. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (157 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Actual lead time is stabilized at 3 periods for planning purposes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 55. The shipment from Period 2 (157 units) is 8 periods old and definitively lost. Historical lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3, Period 3 in 1, Period 4 in 3, Period 5 in 3, Period 7 in 1, and Period 8 in 1. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual average of observed leads is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2 periods. However, to account for the risk of 3-period arrivals and the lost shipment, I am using L=2 (calculate method) but setting a conservative demand forecast. Demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127, 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110, 84) show a mean of ~102. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 122, 127, 79, 110, 84) is slightly lower at ~104. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent average, which when multiplied by (1+L) should provide sufficient stock coverage for the 3-period cycles frequently observed.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 104 in Period 10. The carry-over insights and historical arrival data (P4: lead_time 3, P7: lead_time 3, P8: lead_time 3, P8: lead_time 1) indicate that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. The shipment from P2 is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 382 units in-transit (from P6, P9, and P10). Given the stockout and the need to cover a lead time of 3 periods plus the current period (L+1=4), I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. Demand has been relatively stable, ranging between 79 and 164. I will use a 5-period average for mu_hat (P6-P10) to capture recent demand levels (approx 101/period), and a recent_N sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 11 periods averages 108 units per period, with recent demand (last 3 periods) slightly higher at 103-120 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Examining lead times from concluded messages: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, P7 in 1, and P8 in 1. This volatility makes planning difficult. The Carry-Over Insight correctly notes that the P2 order (157 units) is lost. In-transit inventory excluding the lost P2 order is 280 units (P6: 115, P9: 45, P10: 65, P11: 55). At the start of Period 12, P6 (ordered Period 6) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed). Since P6 is likely lost or significantly delayed, the backend needs to order more to cover the current stockout. I will set lead time L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, and use a recent Window (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean of ~108. This results in a mu_hat aiming for (1+3)*108 = 432 units to cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (115 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed, no arrival as of Period 11 conclude). Total suspected lost units: 157 (P2) + 115 (P6) = 272 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 15 units. Reviewing the history, the shipment from Period 6 (115 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly exceeds both the promised (2) and observed (1-3) lead times; I am officially marking it as lost. This brings the total loss to 272 units (157 from P2, 115 from P6). The in-transit figure of 327 reflects these lost units. By setting lead time L=3 (explicitly), I am telling the OR engine that the pipeline inventory must cover 4 periods (L+1). Since the engine subtracts the full 327 in-transit units (including the 272 lost ones) from the calculated base stock, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the lost units to force an order. Demand over the last 12 periods averages 99 units. Target base stock for L=3 should be roughly (1+3)*99 = 396 units plus safety stock. To trigger an order despite the 327 'ghost' units in-transit, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired base stock plus the volume of confirmed lost inventory (approx 396 + 272 = 668). Sigma is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility while ignoring the anomalous 0 values in early records.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (115 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 272 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 75 in Period 13. The historical average demand is approximately 105 units. Lead times have been highly inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed mode of 3 for several shipments. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (157 units) and Period 6 (115 units) are confirmed lost after 7+ periods of no arrival. The current pipeline inventory (527 units) includes shipments from P11 (55 units), P13 (200 units), and the unknown remainder. However, due to the stockout and the history of lost orders, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stable demand regime (approx. 95-100 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to provide a robust buffer against volatility and timing risks. This conservative approach aims to rebuild safety stock despite the pipeline being large, as some of those units may never arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. The in-transit inventory is 472 units, which includes 200 units from Period 13 and various suspected/confirmed lost units. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, we have confirmed losses from Period 2 (157 units) and Period 6 (115 units), totaling 272 irrecoverable units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 472 - 272 = 200 units. The observed lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent for standard delivery (excluding the 1-period anomalies). I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient buffer (L+1=4 periods of demand). Demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has been [104, 120, 95, 75, 46], showing a recent downward trend, but I will use a recent_N of 5 to balance the mean around 88 units/period. Sigma is set using recent_N=5 to capture this recent variance. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (472) from the base stock, but 272 units are lost, I will set L=3 and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to signal a higher target stock to compensate for the phantom inventory and the high lost-sales risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: on-hand=0, in-transit=660. The system is struggling with frequent stockouts and inconsistent lead times. Lead time analysis (from 'conclude' messages): Period 1 was 3 periods, Period 3 was 1, Period 4 was 3, Period 5 was 3, Period 7 was 1, Period 8 was 1, Period 9 was 3, Period 10 was 2, Period 11 was 3. This indicates a volatile environment where 3 periods is a frequent occurrence. Given the lost shipments (P2 and P6) and current stockout (on-hand=0 with demand lost in P15), a conservative lead time of L=3 is necessary to account for the actual delivery lag. Demand analysis: Demand has been fluctuating between ~46 and ~170 (samples provided in prompt and game history). Recent mean (last 5 periods) is approx 94.2. Setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' N=10 to capture the broad variance and ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the (L+1)=4 period window, totaling approximately 376 units. This should help resolve the current stockout as the OR engine will compare this against the 660 units in transit (some of which are the recently placed large orders of 200 in P13 and 188 in P15).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Observed lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; maintaining planning lead time at 3 to mitigate stockout risk. Total confirmed lost units remain 272.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 17 units. Looking at the history, demand has shown a significant upward shift in the most recent periods (P15: 135, P16: 183), compared to the earlier average of ~90-100. This suggests a demand regime change or a strong seasonal spike. My current in-transit inventory is 460 units (likely comprised of P15's 188 units and P17's current potential order), but we must account for the high lead time volatility. Observed lead times confirm a pattern of 1-3 periods, with 3 periods being frequent for larger orders. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (averaging ~131 per period), which results in a base stock level covering (1+L)=4 periods of this higher demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 15: Average demand increased from ~95 to ~159 units (+67%) over the last two periods. Lead time remains volatile but frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 15. The demand in Period 17 was 212, confirming a significant upward shift from the historical average of ~95. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 586 units in transit. Lead times are volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods (e.g., Period 13 order arrived in Period 16). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (averaging ~177 per period over P15-P17). For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Period 15-17 is 176.7, significantly higher than the previous average of 95. Inventory for Period 13 (200 units) arrived after 3 periods, further supporting the use of L=3 for planning.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 15, with the most recent three periods (P16-P18) averaging 205 units (183, 212, 220), compared to the previous average of ~95. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this surge while incorporating some conservative weight from the start of the shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to safeguard against frequent stockouts observed in the history. While in-transit inventory is 773 units, it includes significant suspected lost shipments (272 units from P2 and P6), which the OR backend does not account for automatically. Setting L=3 and using recent demand data will trigger the necessary order volume to bridge the gap caused by lost inventory and the higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed and accelerating: Average demand from Period 16-18 reached 205 units (+115% vs baseline).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 15. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 183.2 units, a stark increase from the historical average of approximately 95. Planning for Period 20 must account for this higher volume to avoid stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead times remain volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P12, P14, P16 conclusions), so I will maintain L=3 for planning to build a sufficient pipeline. The current in-transit inventory is 815, but arrivals for the last three periods (P17, P18, P19 orders) haven't occurred yet. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high demand and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: Average demand from Period 15-19 is 183.2, a 93% increase over the baseline average of ~95.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 15 is firmly established, with the last 6 periods (P15-P20) averaging 177.67 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~95. Demand in P18-P20 slightly moderated (220, 166, 150) but remains significantly elevated. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 815 units in-transit, including orders from P15 (188 units), P17 (126 units), P18 (187 units), P19 (42 units), and P21 (scheduled). The P15 order is now at T+6, which is double the planning lead time of 3; while historical precedents (P2 and P6) suggest it might be lost, I will maintain L=3 for planning to ensure the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock for the current high-demand regime. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the post-shift average, and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 15 remains significantly higher than baseline, averaging ~178 units over 6 periods. Shipment from Period 15 (188 units) is currently at 6 periods elapsed without arrival, flagging it as potentially lost, following the patterns of P2 and P6.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 15 is confirmed, though the most recent demand (P21: 100) suggests a potential cooling from the peak (P18: 220). The average demand from Period 15 to 21 is approximately 166.5 units. Lead time remains volatile (averaging ~3 periods when items actually arrive). Crucially, we have a significant pipeline 'in-transit' of 815 units, but history shows shipments from Period 2 (157), Period 6 (115), and now likely Period 15 (188) are lost. This means 460 units of the 'in-transit' figure on the dashboard are effectively non-existent. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current high-demand regime (mean ~170) across (1+L) periods. By setting mu_hat = 680 (170 * 4), I ensure the base stock target is high enough to trigger replenishment despite the inflated-but-false pipeline inventory reporting.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Shipment from Period 15 (188 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost units: 157 (P2) + 115 (P6) + 188 (P15) = 460 units. These units must be ignored when accounting for pipeline inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 15, moving from an average of ~95 to ~165 units. Over the last 8 periods (P15-P22), the mean demand is 165.5, and I will use N=8 to capture this higher mean for mu_hat. Regarding lead time, observations fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, but I am maintaining a planning lead time (L) of 3 to provide a safety buffer against stockouts, especially given that on-hand inventory is currently 0. A crucial factor is the pipeline inventory: of the 815 units in-transit, 460 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15 orders). The OR backend does not know these are lost and will over-calculate pipeline inventory, resulting in under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 165.5 = 662. Capped policy = min(base_stock - visible_pipeline, cap). Since visible_pipeline is 815 but effective_pipeline is only 355 (815-460), I must inflate mu_hat to overcome the 'phantom' 460 units. I will set mu_hat to 1122 (662 base + 460 offset) to force the solver to ignore the lost units and replenish stock.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 15, with demand averaging approximately 176 units over the last 9 periods (P15-P23), compared to the earlier baseline of ~95. Although recent demand peaked and then slightly softened (P23 demand was 80), the overall mean dictates a higher safety stock level. Lead times have been highly volatile, peaking at 3 periods, and multiple shipments have been lost (P2, P6, P15), creating a pattern of unreliability. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 1161, but this includes potentially lost or stuck shipments. The backend's pipeline calculation includes these units, which might lead to under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting L=3 to account for the longest observed lead time and using the recent high-demand regime (N=9, from P15 onwards) to set my demand forecast and volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher average demand and the buffer reflects the high variance seen in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Consistently high demand regime continues since Period 15: Average demand from P15-P23 is ~176 units (approx 85% increase from baseline). Shipment from Period 17 (126 units) is now 6 periods overdue, and Period 18 (187 units) is 5 periods overdue, suggesting a possible cluster of lost orders or a severe lead-time blowout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 15. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is approximately 167.5 units, compared to the baseline of ~95. Recent periods show high volatility (e.g., P24 demand of 271). Regarding lead times, the environment is highly unstable with frequent lost shipments and delayed arrivals. Order P17 (126 units) and P18 (187 units) are now 7 and 6 periods overdue respectively without concluding; following the pattern of P2, P6, and P15, these are highly likely lost. The current 'In-transit' of 1161 includes these likely lost units. To ensure the backend OR logic (which assumes all pipeline inventory arrives) orders sufficiently to meet the higher demand, I will set L=3 (as the upper bound of observed successful lead times) and use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent high-demand regime (~170 units/period) across the (L+1) horizon. I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Shipments from Period 17 (126 units) and Period 18 (187 units) are now 7 and 6 periods overdue with no arrival, categorized as likely lost. Total suspected lost units: 157 (P2) + 115 (P6) + 188 (P15) + 126 (P17) + 187 (P18) = 773 units. Maintaining L=3 for planning due to high environmental uncertainty.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 25 is approximately 173 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~95. The most recent demand was 182 units. Lead times remain erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with several shipments confirmed or highly suspected as lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Specifically, the current 'In-transit' figure of 815 includes suspected lost units: P15 (188), P17 (126), and P18 (187), totaling 501 units that are likely never arriving. To compensate for the high demand (avg ~175) and systemic transit losses, I will maintain the planning lead time L=3. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=11 (P15-P25) to capture the higher regime, and increase sigma_hat marginally to account for the high variance and shipment uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 17 (126 units) and Period 18 (187 units) are now 8 and 7 periods overdue respectively; along with P2, P6, and P15, total confirmed/likely lost units now stand at 773. Planning must treat these as non-existent in the pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 15, moving from an average of ~95 units to approximately 177 units (P15-P26). Recent demand has shown high volatility (e.g., 271 in P24 vs 60 in P26). Regarding inventory, the pipeline is severely compromised. A total of 773 units from orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 are either confirmed lost or heavily overdue (7+ periods) and must be excluded from effective pipeline inventory. The current 'In-transit' of 815 units includes these lost units, leaving only 42 units (from P19) as truly 'in-transit'. With On-hand inventory at 104 and a lead time of 3 periods, we need to ensure the system orders enough to cover the high demand regime. I am setting L=3 to account for historical volatility and using recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated post-Period 15 demand while accounting for recent high-variance spikes. This configuration will force the OR backend to reconcile the inventory deficit and place an order to meet the higher demand target.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Inventory deficit check - Effective pipeline inventory is only 42 units (from P19) because 773 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed/likely lost. Current high demand regime since P15 continues, averaging 177 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~95 to approximately 177 units. Recent demand (P24-P27) shows continued high volatility (271, 182, 60, 239). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the pipeline is severely compromised. 773 units from orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 are definitively or likely lost (7+ periods elapsed). This means the 'In-transit' count of 815 is deceptive; the effective pipeline is only 42 units (from P19). Lead times are volatile, but a planning lead time (L) of 3 is necessary to protect service levels given the unreliability. I will use the recent demand regime (last 13 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use an explicit L=3 to account for historical delays and ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover the deficit left by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Effective pipeline inventory is severely depleted. Total lost units confirmed or likely are 773 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Demand regime remains elevated (avg ~177 since P15) with high variance. Lead time planning must assume 3 periods despite formal 2-period promise.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory situation is critical despite an in-transit balance of 815 units. Based on historical evidence and carry-over insights, 773 units from specific orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are 7 to 27 periods old. Only the 42 units from Period 19 remain potentially viable in the pipeline, but even those are 10 periods old, suggesting they may also be lost. Demand since Period 15 has shifted to a significantly higher regime, averaging approximately 177 units per period with high volatility (standard deviation ~65). While the promised lead time is 2 periods, the observed lead time is often 3 periods. To prevent stockouts in this high-demand, high-unreliability environment, I am setting L=3 to cover the risk and using 'recent_N' for demand (N=14 to capture the regime since P15) and volatility to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the recent high-variance behavior.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Effective pipeline inventory is likely zero as all previous in-transit units (including the 42 from P19) have exceeded reasonable lead times without arrival. The demand regime initiated at P15 remains stable at an elevated mean (~177) and high volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains elevated and highly volatile, with a mean demand around 177 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' count of 815 units is misleading because 773 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on the 7+ period delay observed for each. The only viable in-transit units are from P19 (42 units), which are also now significantly overdue. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is effectively 0. To protect against the high demand and volatile lead times (which frequently hit 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure a higher base stock level. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the high-demand regime starting at P15, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=15 to account for the increased volatility in that same period.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed at 0 units as all previous orders (including the 42 units from P19) have exceeded 10 periods without arrival. Total lost units updated to 815 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 177 units. Recent demand in Periods 27-30 (239, 225, 69, 110) shows continued high volatility. Inventory management is severely complicated by a very high rate of lost shipments. All orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 815 units) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost as they have exceeded 10 periods since ordering. Consequently, the 'In-transit' count of 815 is effectively zero for planning purposes. Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's logic. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent observed lead time delays and help build a safety buffer. For mu_hat, I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the regime average (~177) plus the 815 'phantom' units in the pipeline that the backend will incorrectly subtract: (177 * 4) + 815 = 1523. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the false pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set to cover the high historical variance observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total lost units reach 815 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline inventory is zero. High demand regime (avg 177) persists with high volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~95 to approximately 177 units per period. Recent demand remains highly volatile (last 5 periods: 239, 225, 69, 110, 225). Lead times are unstable, settling on 3 periods for planning to prevent stockouts despite the promised 2. A massive inventory reconciliation is required: 815 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost as they are 12+ periods overdue. The current In-transit balance is 1320 units (P23=346, P31=505, and the lost units). Since 815 units are lost and 346 arrived (P25 conclude), the effective pipeline before the Period 31 order was zero. The Period 31 order of 505 units is the only active pipeline. Setting L=3 and using recent_N (N=17) for demand capture since the P15 shift to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and volatility. This helps maintain a high service level in a high-loss, high-demand environment.

The most recent demand (P31: 225, P32: 119) maintains this elevated mean but with high volatility (sigma). Regarding supply, 815 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), meaning the current 'In-transit' figure consists entirely of non-arriving stock. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Although Period 31's order arrived in just 1 period, historical data shows frequent lead times of 3 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-volatility, high-demand environment, I will use L=3 for planning. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=18) to capture the current regime since Period 15, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=18) to account for the high variance observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Total lost units in pipeline remains 815 (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime from Period 15-32 stable at higher mean (~166 units). Effective pipeline inventory is currently 0 after the P31 arrival.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains elevated and highly volatile, with a mean around 166 units and frequent spikes (e.g., 399 units in Period 33). The effective pipeline inventory is currently 0, as all units in 'In-transit' (815 units from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19) are confirmed lost based on significantly exceeded lead times. Although the promised lead time is 2, observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To mitigate the risk of stockouts during this high-demand, high-variability phase, I am setting L=3 for planning. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=19 to encompass the entire high-demand regime starting from Period 15, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (1+3) periods of this elevated demand. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility of this period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains elevated and volatile. Using the last 20 samples (P15-P34), the average demand is approximately 166 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline analysis reveals a severe issue: 815 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost, having exceeded all reasonable lead times. The 19 units ordered in Period 34 are currently the only valid pipeline inventory. While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3. I will maintain L=3 to protect against stockouts during this high-demand, high-uncertainty phase. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand based on the recent regime average (approx 166 * 4 = 664). sigma_hat is calculated from the recent 20-period volatility to ensure the service level accounts for the significant demand spikes (like Period 33's 399 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed/likely lost units remain 815 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime P15-P34 remains stable at a higher mean of ~166. Effective pipeline inventory consists only of orders placed from P34 onwards.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain instability and a high-demand regime established around Period 15. Total lost units in the pipeline are confirmed at 815 (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 834 units listed as 'In-transit' include these 815 lost units plus the small P34 order (19 units). Therefore, for the OR backend, the functional pipeline is effectively only 19 units. In Period 35, we observed a massive demand spike of 688 units. While this may be an outlier, the post-P15 average has shifted significantly higher than the initial baseline (~170+ vs 95). To prevent catastrophic stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and the high likelihood of lead-time variations (historically L=3 is safer), I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat to capture the elevated demand level and the recent major spike. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility seen in Period 35.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Massive demand outlier detected in P35 (688 units); while potentially anomalous, it significantly increases immediate variance. Functional pipeline remains near zero as 815 units are confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0. Period 36 conclude shows the arrival of 19 units (ordered Period 34), confirming a lead time of 2. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1200 units is heavily inflated by 815 confirmed/likely lost units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is actually 385 units (from P36). A massive demand outlier of 688 occurred in P35; while possibly a one-off, it has significantly skewed the recent variance. Excluding that outlier, the demand 'regime' starting Period 15 averages ~170-180 units. To protect against the high volatility seen in P35 and the historical lead-time instability (often 3 periods), I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough safety stock. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=22 (covering the high-demand regime since P15) to capture the elevated mean while mitigating the extreme influence of the P35 outlier compared to a shorter window. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to incorporate historical volatility plus the recent outlier's impact on standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed effective pipeline is 385 units (P36 order); 815 units remain confirmed/likely lost. Demand outlier of 688 in P35 has significantly increased system volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains significantly higher and more volatile than the baseline, with a mean around 177 units. However, Period 35 showed a massive outlier (688 units) followed by Period 37 with zero demand (likely a data correction or severe fluctuation), which has inflated the variance significantly. On-hand inventory is currently 385 units. The 815 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed/likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) and are being ignored for planning. Since actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, I am maintaining L=3 to protect against stockouts during this high-volatility period. I will use the last 23 samples (since the P15 shift) to calculate mu_hat, which captures the current high-demand environment (~185 units per period including the outlier), and the same for sigma_hat to account for the increased risk.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 15, with a mean demand of approximately 177 units. Recent periods (P35-P38) show extreme volatility, including a massive outlier of 688 in P35 and a zero-demand period in P37. The current on-hand inventory is 193 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 815 units is composed entirely of orders confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to use L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 4-period risk window (L+1) required to bridge potential 3-period delays. Given the high variance introduced by recent anomalies, I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the elevated regime while smoothing the P35 outlier slightly. The OR backend will see effective pipeline as 815, so my parameters must account for the fact that these 815 units will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed/likely lost units remains 815 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand volatility remains extreme following the P35 outlier (688 units).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains elevated with an average around 177 units, despite high volatility and a significant outlier in Period 35 (688 units). After auditing the pipeline, 815 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded all reasonable lead times. These must be excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Currently, on-hand inventory is 89 units and the effective (functional) in-transit inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility environment, I am setting L=3 to account for historical lead time fluctuations. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=25) to capture the higher demand regime since Period 15 while dampening the Period 35 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the heightened volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 112) observed in this regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is at Period 41. All previous 'In-transit' units (totaling 815) have been confirmed lost as they haven't arrived within 10+ periods. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore 0. Demand shifted starting at Period 15 to a higher mean (approx. 177 units). While Period 35 showed a massive outlier (688), demand has since returned to the 100-200 range (P38: 192, P39: 104, P40: 175). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to plan with L=3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat (N=26, targeting the start of the regime shift at P15) and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility caused by the P35 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline confirmed as zero; original 815 units remain lost. Demand regime since P15 remains elevated (avg ~175) but with extreme variance due to P35 outlier (688 units).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains elevated with a mean of approximately 175 units, though volatility is high (skewed by the 688-unit outlier in Period 35). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity of 948 units includes 815 units confirmed/likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 133 units (ordered in Period 41). Given the history of lead time variability (flunctuating between 1 and 3 periods), I maintain L=3 for planning to ensure high service levels and mitigate stockout risks during the final periods. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=27) to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 15, and sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to account for the increased variance.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the product chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and a total in-transit quantity of 948 units. However, based on extensive historical tracking, 815 units of this pipeline (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are now significantly past any observed lead time (10+ periods for most). The effective pipeline consists only of the order from P41 (133 units). Demand since Period 15 has sustained a higher mean (avg ~175) but with extreme volatility, notably the 688-unit outlier in Period 35. Recent demand in the last two periods (P41-42) has been lower (90 and 66 units), but given the zero on-hand status and the unreliability of the pipeline, I will maintain parameters that account for the 175-unit mean regime and high variance. I will use L=3 to hedge against lead-time volatility (historically ranging 1-3 periods). mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3)*175, and sigma_hat is kept high to accommodate the high variance (std of recent samples including the outlier is large).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Effective pipeline inventory is only 133 units (ordered P41). Cumulative confirmed lost units remains 815. High variance regime continues, though recent demand (P41-P42) is below the post-P15 average of 175.

The current in-transit inventory is 1,042 units, but 815 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed or likely lost as they are far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore only 227 units (P41: 133 units, P43: 94 units). Given the high uncertainty and volatile lead times (historically 1 to 3 periods), I am maintaining L=3 to protect against stockouts. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the elevated demand mean since Period 15 while dampening the effect of the extreme outlier in Period 35, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the current heightened volatility environment.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 analysis: 815 units remain confirmed or highly likely lost (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The current In-transit total is 968 units. Subtracting the 815 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 153 units (94 from P43 and 59 from P44). Demand since Period 15 has been in an elevated regime with significant volatility, emphasized by the massive outlier in P35 (688 units) and recent spikes (e.g., P43-P44 averaging ~350 units). I am maintaining L=3 because observed lead times consistently hit 3 periods. For demand (mu_hat), the mean since P15 is approximately 175, but given the recent surge in the last two periods, I will use recent_N=30 to capture the post-increase mean while stabilizing against the extreme volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=30 to account for the heightened variance introduced by the P35 outlier and recent spikes, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient saltatory base stock to handle demand peaks.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 874, but 815 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed/likely lost based on historical lead times. Effective pipeline consists only of P44 (59 units). Demand Context: Period 43-45 saw a massive spike in demand (352, 349, 242 respectively), confirming the high-variance, high-mean regime that started around Period 15. The P35 outlier (688) also remains in the historical window, driving up volatility. Parameter Setup: 1) L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to accommodate observed delays (e.g., P41 took 3 periods). 2) mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=31 (covering the shift from P15 to P45) to capture the higher mean of ~185 while discounting the initial 14 periods of low demand. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=31 to capture the high volatility seen in this period, including recent spikes and the P35 outlier. This setup ensures the base stock reflects the current elevated demand level and provides a safety buffer against the extreme variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 15 continues to show extreme volatility and periodic massive spikes (P35: 688, P43-P44: ~350). Effective pipeline inventory is restricted to orders placed from Period 44 onwards; previous 815 units remain lost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains significantly elevated compared to the early periods, with periodic massive spikes causing high volatility (P35: 688, P43-P44: ~350). The average demand since Period 15 is approximately 175 units. Effective pipeline inventory management is critical because 815 units from historical orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and must be excluded from calculations. Current in-transit inventory consists of Period 44 (59 units), Period 46 (98 units), and the order logic from the OR backend. Since Period 47 is near the end of the simulation (Game end: P50), and we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with high demand volatility, I will maintain a lead time estimate of L=3 to account for historical delivery delays and set mu_hat to the recent average (approx 175) over the last 30 periods to capture the sustained high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the high variance induced by recent demand spikes without over-reacting to the P35 outlier in the long-term context.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The demand regime starting around Period 15 remains significantly elevated (average ~175 units) compared to the initial baseline, characterized by extreme volatility and occasional massive spikes (e.g., P35: 688, P43-P44: ~350). The 'In-transit' figure of 1065 units is misleading due to substantial historical losses. Based on the carry-over insights, 815 units from early periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost. The remaining effective pipeline consists of more recent orders: P44 (59 units), P46 (98 units), and P47 (93 units), totaling 250 units. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 for planning to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay and reduces stockout risk. Demand will be forecasted using the last 33 samples (since Period 15) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This approach enables the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the lead time + current period (L+1) while respecting the 815 lost units in the pipeline calculation.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high demand regime originating at Period 15 and extreme volatility caused by large spikes (P35: 688 units, P43-P44: ~350 units). Effective pipeline inventory is severely compromised: 815 units (ordered P2 through P19) are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1065 includes these 815 lost units, plus orders from P44 (59), P46 (98), and P47 (93). The P44 order (59 units) is now at L=5 without arrival, making it a candidate for loss, but I will wait for one more period before flagging it. Demand since Period 15 has averaged ~175 units, but recent spikes have skewed the variance. I will set L=3 to account for frequent lead-time stretches. I will use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing the P35 outlier slightly, and explicit sigma_hat to account for the heightened risk of massive spikes seen in recent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains elevated and highly volatile (Period 49 demand was 338). Recent periods (P43-P49) show significant spikes, making the P35 outlier of 688 less anomalous and more indicative of the current variance. On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 1065 units is heavily skewed by 815 units that have been confirmed or likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only 'live' pipeline units are from P44 (59), P46 (98), and P47 (93), totaling 250 units. To address this, I am maintaining L=3 for planning to mitigate lead-time volatility. For mu_hat, I'm using an explicit forecast based on the post-P15 average (~175) over the (L+1) window, resulting in 700 units. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit high value to account for the extreme spikes observed recently, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to prevent frequent stockouts in this high-risk environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Effectively only 250 units are in the pipeline; 815 units remain confirmed lost. Demand regime continues to exhibit extreme volatility with frequent spikes above 300 units.
