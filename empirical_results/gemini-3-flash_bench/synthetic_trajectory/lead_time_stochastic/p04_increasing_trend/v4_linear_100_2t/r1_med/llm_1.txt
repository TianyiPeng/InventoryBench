The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (already passed or happening), Period 2, and Period 3 to ensure availability when the order arrives. Given 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit units, I must place an order immediately. I will target a stock level to cover approximately 3 periods of average demand (L+1 = 3), which is roughly 277 units. I'll round up slightly to 300 to account for potential variance seen in the history (e.g., the 170 spike).",

Therefore, I currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 300 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 79 (vs. historical average of ~92 excluding the zero in P3 history). However, since there was 0 on-hand inventory, 0 units were sold. To maximize total reward, I need to maintain a pipeline that covers the lead time plus the decision period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using a conservative estimate of 100 units per period (based on the provided historical samples: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127), the required pipeline is roughly 300-400 units. Since 300 are already in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3, I will place an order for 100 units now to ensure stock for Period 4 and beyond, accounting for current stockouts and the need to rebuild inventory levels once shipments arrive.",

While we saw extreme spikes previously (up to 688), current demand has stabilized closer to the historical high-regime mean. We currently hold 1306 units on-hand. With an average demand of ~200 units (representing a safe upper estimate for the current regime), we have approximately 6-7 periods of safety stock. The pipeline (In-transit: 2250 units) includes the order from Period 37 (400 units), while the status of many earlier orders remains 'lost' based on historical patterns of high shipment failure. Specifically, orders from P17-P33 (total 1800 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The useful pipeline consists of only the P37 order. Total useful inventory (On-hand + P37) is 1706 units. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, and the fact that we have over 8 periods of coverage at current demand levels, there is no justification for further ordering. Maintaining a zero-order strategy to burn off the expensive inventory surplus is the most profitable path.",

Given a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, maintaining this surplus is costly. No further orders are required until the inventory levels normalize significantly. The 'In-transit' figure of 2250 includes 1550 units previously identified as lost (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33) and 700 units from the P37 order. I will continue to hold ordering at 0.",

There are also 2,250 units in-transit, although history shows a significant portion of older in-transit units (approx 1,550-1,800 units from Periods 17-33) are certainly lost. Even excluding those, the more recent orders (P34-P37) have mostly arrived, and the current on-hand balance is sufficient for the remaining 6 periods of the game (44-50).

Specifically, the P37 order of 400 units is now 8 periods old and follows the confirmed loss pattern, and the P34-P36 surge orders have already arrived. Current arrivals are expected from P45 onwards if new orders are placed. Given the game ends at Period 50, we have 5 periods remaining. Total expected demand for the remainder is ~1065 units (5 periods * 213 units). With 539 on hand, we need approximately 526 more units to arrive.
