Demand Analysis: Historical data shows demand samples [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with an average of roughly 92 units per period. In Period 1, actual demand was 132 units (higher than the provided historical average). We are currently in Period 2.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand = 0. In-transit = 197 (from Period 1).

Total inventory needed to cover Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+2 periods of coverage) is approximately 110 (avg) * 4 = 440 units.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 100 units. Adding 100 to the existing 197 in-transit gives 297 units. Given the recent demand of 132 and the volatility in history, 297 might be slightly lean for 4 periods of coverage.

In-transit inventory is 314 units (from Period 2: 100 unts, Period 5: 214 units). The order from Period 2 is significantly overdue (placed P2, expected P4 or P5), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. Demand Analysis: Historical demand has been volatile (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 based on context samples; 132, 100, 80, 221, 70 based on game history). The average demand is approximately 120 units/period. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 6 units is extremely low because it likely accounts for the 314 units in-transit as guaranteed arrivals.

P4 saw a massive spike (221), while P7 was very low (6). The current OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (434) exceeds its calculated base-stock. 4. Strategy: There is a severe risk of persistent stockouts because nothing has arrived for 3 periods (P5, P6, P7) despite orders being placed. Even if P5 and P6 arrive in P8, they only total 334 units.

This in-transit consists of orders from Period 17 (150), Period 18 (150), and likely residual lost units (Period 2 and Period 6 both totaling 220 units were already declared lost). Subtracting the 220 lost units, the effective pipeline is 300 units (150 from P17, 150 from P18). 3.

The system displays an in-transit inventory of 2,170 units; however, historical tracking in Carry-over Insights reveals a massive 'phantom pipeline' due to lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P17-P20 (500 units), P24-P25 (400 units), and P29-P30 (400 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,300 units. The effective pipeline is actually 870 units (the sum of orders P33, P35, and P36). The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 31, with a high mean demand of approximately 250-300 units per period. The OR recommendation of 0 is significantly flawed because it includes the 1,300 lost units in its pipeline calculation and uses a long-term demand average that doesn't reflect the recent surge (P31 demand was 509, P34 was 357). Looking at the arrivals, recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (P31, P32, P34), though reliability remains a concern. With 0 on-hand and recent high demand, we must order to cover the gap. The effective pipeline (870) plus our new order must cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1). At an average demand of ~250, we need ~750 units. While the 870 in transit seems sufficient theoretically, the erratic loss of prior large shipments suggests we should maintain a safety buffer and replace recently sold-out stock.

Given the high demand volatility and recent peaks near 300 units, we need to maintain a continuous inflow. Since this is Period 49 of 50, any order placed now (lead time 1-3 periods) will likely arrive in the final period or too late.
