Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historic demand samples (Periods 1-5) show values [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with an average of 92.4. Since demand for Period 1 occurs after the decision, I must set parameters to cover the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using all available samples provides the best baseline. Note: Period 3 had zero demand, which increases volatility (sigma).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 197 units, but they haven't arrived yet due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 132, which resulted in 0 sales because on-hand inventory was 0. Current on-hand is 0, and 197 units are in-transit (expected in Period 3). Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127] plus the observed Period 1 demand of 132. There is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods (L=2). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (including the seed data) to establish a baseline, as there is no clear regime shift yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1=75, P2=90, P3=0 (provided in training data), P4=170, P5=127. However, the game history provided in the prompt shows actual demand for P1=132 and P2=100. I will prioritize the game history. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (197 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of P3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. The P2 order (100 units) is expected to arrive during P4. The total in-transit is 297 units. Since we have no actual lead time arrivals yet, I'll stick to the promised lead time (L=2). For demand forecasting, I will use a recent window (N=3 if available, but here only 2 periods of history exist) to estimate the mean. Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a service level q = 0.5, but the system's stock logic will handle the safety stock based on my sigma estimate.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (197 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival window and be reflected in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This suggests either the lead time is longer than 2 periods or the shipment is lost/delayed. Historical demand (132, 100, 80) averages approx 104 units/period, but currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced 3 periods of lost sales. With 359 units in transit (197+100+62), we must ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed delay. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the missing P1 delivery and 'recent_N' for demand to stabilize around the observed samples while waiting for inventory to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) appears longer than promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (197 units) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the early period orders. The Period 1 order (197 units) arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (promised 2), while the Period 3 order (62 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period (promised 2). The Period 2 order (100 units) is currently missing (calculated lead time would be 3+ if it arrives later), though the prompt notes only 157 units are currently 'In-transit' (100 from P2 and 57 from P4), confirming no losses are registered yet. Demand samples (excluding P3 as a potential outlier/reporting error) are 75, 90, 170, 127, showing significant volatility. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed shifts (3 and 1) and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand to capture the recent higher demand levels while smoothing the noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. Demand regime remains volatile with mean approx 115 across last 4 active periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent consumption patterns show high volatility. Period 5 demand was 70, but we only sold 38 due to stockout. The Period 1 order (197) arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), and the Period 3 order (62) also arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). This confirms a mean lead time of 2, but with significant jitter. Pipeline inventory is 393 units (Orders from P2 [100], P4 [57], and P5 [236]). The Period 2 order is currently overdue (placed in P2, expected P4 base on L=2, now P6). Total historical mean demand is approx 100 per period (sum=542 over 5 periods), but the last 3 periods (80, 221, 70) show very high variance. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the increased volatility (Period 2 to 5) and keep L at explicit 2 to account for the jittery but on-average promised delivery, while the OR backend's safety stock logic (sigma_hat) will address the high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as unstable/jittery (P1=3, P3=1); P2 order (100 units) is currently overdue as of P6.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 393 units in-transit. Historical demand shows significant volatility (P1: 132, P2: 100, P3: 80, P4: 221, P5: 70, P6: 72). The order from Period 2 (100 units) is now extremely overdue (effectively lead time > 4 periods), while other orders showed lead times of 3 (P1) and 1 (P3). This indicates a highly unstable supply chain. Based on the last 5 periods (excluding P1), the average demand is 108.6. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with setting the base stock near the mean demand over the lead time. I will set L to 3 (recent worst-case confirmed arrival) to allow the OR backend to account for a longer lead time. I'll use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the volatile history, and set sigma_hat explicitly high to buffer against both demand and lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) is extremely unstable: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (100 units) remains missing after 5 periods (placed P2, no arrival through P6 conclude).

Daily Profit: $6.00, Daily Holding Cost: $51.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular) with significant lead-time instability and a likely lost shipment. History shows lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3). Critically, the P2 order of 100 units is now 5 periods overdue (placed P2, current is P8 start), which strongly suggests it is lost. Our current On-hand is 51, and In-transit is 393 (from P5 and P7). Demand has been volatile: after a spike in P4 (221), it dropped significantly, with P7 recording only 6 units (though previous periods averaged around 70-130). Calculation: Average demand over P1-P7 is approx 97. Given the extreme lead-time jitter (max 3), I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR engine accounts for the longest observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the shift from the high-demand period (P4) to the more recent lower-demand sequence (P5-P7), while still maintaining enough safety for the average. Sigma_hat will use the same N=4 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (100 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods since placement, promised 2). Lead time is highly unstable with a maximum observed of 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-90.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 217 units. Looking at the arrival history, lead times for chips(Regular) are highly erratic: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1, P4 took 3, P5 took 3, and P7 took 1. The P2 order (100 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost. Because actual lead times consistently range up to 3 periods (exceeding the promised 2), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer-than-promised pipeline. Demand has been volatile: the mean of the last 5 samples (P4-P8) is (221+70+72+6+127)/5 = 99.2. Including the zero-demand periods from the prompt's historical data (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), the overall average remains near 100-110. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime of approx 100 units per period. The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for high volatility (the demand drop to 6 in P7 vs 221 in P4). This configuration targets a 50% service level (as profit=holding_cost) over a 4-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) oscillates between 1 and 3 periods (Observed: P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=3, P8=1); P2 order is definitively lost. Demand volatility is high with a 5-period average of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-211.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1), with one order (P2) definitively lost. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the longest observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers this extended period. Demand is also volatile; while the historical average is ~104, recent periods 7 and 9 showed extremely low demand (6 and 3). However, periods 4, 5, and 8 showed significantly higher activity. To balance the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent variance while smoothing out the extreme outliers. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for the frequent 3-period lead time arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-70.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 142 units with 180 units in transit (80 from P9, 100 from P10). Historically, lead times have been highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1), and the P2 order was lost entirely. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average based on successful arrivals is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2. To account for the risk of 3-period lead times and the loss of the P2 order, I will set L to 3 (explicitly choosing the maximum observed lead time to ensure coverage). Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 88.3 units, but recent periods show significant volatility (P9=3, P10=72). I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out the extreme low of P9. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility levels.

In Period 12, we are at zero on-hand inventory with 180 units in-transit (80 from P9, 100 from P12's systemic order logic). Historical data shows demand is highly volatile, ranging from 3 to 221. The last 11 periods have a mean of approx 102. Recent demand in P11 spiked to 209, depleting all inventory. Lead times are unstable: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1. The P9 order (80 units) is now at Period 12 and has not arrived; if it follows the frequent 3-period delay, it should arrive during this period (visible P13). I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation base for OR parameters but acknowledge the 3-period risk. Given the high volatility and recent stockout, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~92) and sigma_hat to capture recent variance, ensuring the OR engine targets a higher stock level to mitigate stockout risk during lead-time jitter.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (P11 spike to 209). Lead time jitter persists, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2, Max observed 3). P2 order is confirmed lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains highly volatile with a recent spike of 209 in Period 11 and 85 in Period 12. Lead times are unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). The order from Period 2 is confirmed lost. My objective is to reset parameters to ensure the replenishment covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1) while accounting for this arrival jitter. I will use an explicit lead time of 3 (the observed maximum) to protect against delays, set mu_hat based on the average demand of the last 4 active periods (~112 units per period * (3+1) = 448), and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std of last 5 periods is ~74, so sqrt(1+3)*74 \u2248 148).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is out of stock (on-hand = 0). Historical context shows extreme lead time instability, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). Recent demand has trended upward, including a major spike of 209 in Period 11 and 166 in Period 13, significantly exceeding the long-term average. To account for this higher demand regime and the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering periods 9-13) to capture the recent high-volume trend, which averages ~107 units per period. This results in a forecast of (1+L) * 107 = 428. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=5 to capture current volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer given the equal profit and holding costs (implying a 0.5 cycle service level target, but with high variance, robust base stock is needed).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 11: Recent 5-period average demand increased to ~107 compared to earlier intervals. Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods despite a 2-period promise.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent regime shift with higher volume: the average demand from Period 11 to 14 is approximately 115 units, despite a zero reading in Period 14 (which might be a reporting lag or a stockout effect). The lead time is confirmed to be erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods instead of the promised 2 (Observed: P1=3, P4=3, P5=3, P9=3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 428 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, and P14). To protect against the frequently observed 3-period lead time and recent demand spikes (e.g., P11=209), I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval (L+1=4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the higher demand regime started in P11 (avg ~115) rather than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to 20 periods to capture the significant volatility seen across the history (range 0 to 221).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent regime shift since Period 11, with demand levels frequently exceeding 100 units. The 5-period average (P11-P15) is 115.8, while the 10-period average is 84.1. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to better capture this heightened demand and volatility. Lead time remains erratic, with multiple occurrences of 3-period arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P12) despite a promised 2-period lead time. Calculating 'L' based on historical data correctly accounts for this 3-period max observed jitter (mean ~2.3). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 389 units in transit, but because of the high demand spikes (P11=209, P13=166, P15=119), the pipeline must be maintained aggressively to prevent frequent stockouts. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 aligns with the most recent demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~116 avg over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), up from previously lower averages. Lead time consistently reaches 3 periods in ~60% of observed non-lost arrivals.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the last 5 periods (P12-P16) shows a demand mean of approximately 111.8 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of a stabilized higher demand regime (~116). The lead time remains highly erratic and frequently hits 3 periods, necessitating an explicit L = 3.0 to ensure the inventory covers the pipeline plus the current period's demand. The on-hand inventory is low (49) relative to current demand trends, and although 230 units are in-transit, 41% of orders have historically arrived with a 3-period lead time. Using an explicit L of 3.0 and mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) provides a robust safety buffer against frequent 3-period delays and high demand volatility, balancing the $1.0/$1.0 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level offset by the safety cap).

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand is currently in a high-volatility regime, with Period 17 experiencing a significant spike to 297 units, following a trend of increasing mean demand. The recent 5-period average (P13-P17) is approximately 153 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 116. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while 297 units are in-transit, the lead time for chips(Regular) continues to be erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed for orders from P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13, and P14). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting L to 3 (the max observed non-lost lead time). I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining enough sample size to account for the extreme variance seen in the last step.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Significant spike to 297 units; 5-period average (P13-P17) increased to approx 153 units (+32% from previous regime). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a significant shift. Period 17 saw a spike to 297, and while Period 18 dropped to 58, the overall volatility remains high. The 5-period average (P14-P18) is approximately 132, but given the carry-over insight of a regime shift at Period 17, I am focusing on the most recent 8 periods (P11-P18) which better capture this higher-demand phase (avg ~127). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 605 units in transit (mostly ordered in P17 and P18). Lead time (L) is consistently observed as 3 periods (60% of cases) despite the promise of 2, so I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the (L+1) coverage. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current demand regime. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=8 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent spikes, helping the OR engine set a higher base stock to protect against stockouts in this highly variable environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a high-volatility phase; 8-period average (P11-P18) is ~127 units. Lead time continues to frequently manifest as 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, we are facing an on-hand stockout with 0 units, despite a high demand regime. The demand history shows a significant shift starting around Period 11, with recent periods (P11-P19) averaging ~127 units, including a massive peak of 297 in Period 17 and a total demand of 134 across the last two periods (P18-P19) where we had no stock. Lead time is consistently erratic, frequently taking 3 periods (P12, P13, P14, P16 all took 3 periods to arrive). I am setting L to 3 to account for this recurring delay and ensure the base stock formula (L+1) covers enough demand. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 9 (Period 11-19) to capture the higher average and volatility seen in the second half of the game. I observe 605 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, P18), which should arrive soon; however, the persistent lead-time jitter and recent 0 on-hand status necessitate robust parameters to recover and maintain stock levels for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 19 averaged ~127 units per period, representing a sustained increase and higher volatility compared to early periods. Lead time of 3 periods has become the dominant mode (observed in 4 of the last 5 successful arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) following a massive demand spike of 420 units in Period 20. The current 10-period average demand (Periods 11-20) is approximately 151.5 units, which is significantly higher and more volatile than the early-game average. Lead time is officially promised at 2 periods, but historical data ('Period X conclude' messages) shows it frequently reaches 3 periods (e.g., Period 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 all resulted in 3-period lead times). Therefore, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime that started around Period 11, while including the recent volatility. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in this period. Pipeline inventory is currently 605 units (orders from P15, P17, P18), but P15 and P17 are now potentially overdue or nearing the tail end of the 3-period window. The OR backend will use these parameters to try and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: 10-period average (P11-P20) increased to ~152 units compared to previous intervals, with high volatility (max demand 420).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P11-P21) shows an average demand of approximately 154 units per period (\u03a3=1698 / 11 periods), with high volatility peaking at 420. Lead times are consistently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safest conservative estimate for the OR backend's L parameter. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 646 units in-transit (ordered P15=32, P17=165, P18=308, P21=41). Given the current stockout and the high demand average, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory position (IP = on-hand + in-transit) is evaluated against a (3+1) period horizon. mu_hat is set to 154 * (3+1) = 616 using the 'explicit' method to stabilize against the recent high-demand regime. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the high volatility since Period 11.

The demand regime shifted definitively at Period 11, with the average demand for Period 11 through Period 22 rising to approximately 161 units (calculated from Period 11-22 demands: 209, 85, 166, 0, 119, 185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263, 169). The high volatility (standard deviation > 100) and frequent stockouts necessitate a higher safety stock. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in the majority of recent successful arrivals). I am setting L to 3 to account for this reality. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=12) to capture the increased mean of the current regime. sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 12 periods to reflect the heightened volatility. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 646 units in transit (ordered in P15: 32, P17: 165, P18: 308, P21: 41), several of which are now overdue or nearing the 3-period mark.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 22 has sustained a higher mean of ~161 units with significant volatility (max 420). Lead time is consistently observed at 3 periods in recent history.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, with the last 13 periods (P11-P23) showing a significantly higher mean (approx. 165 units) and extreme volatility (max 420). The recent 5-period average (P19-P23) is roughly 226 units, reflecting a further upward trend. Lead time remains highly erratic and frequently settles at 3 periods, one period longer than the promised 2. Stockouts have been persistent (ending on-hand=0 for many periods), indicating current pipeline inventory is failing to meet realized demand surges. To address this, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays and use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 23 has sustained a higher mean of ~165 units with intense volatility (max 420). Lead time is consistently reaching 3 periods in recent successful arrivals.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 11, moving from a lower mean to a higher, more volatile state. Over the last 14 periods (P11-P24), demand has averaged approximately 161 units per period, with extreme spikes reaching 420. Lead time remains unstable but is frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in most recent successful arrivals like P12, P13, P14, and P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite massive in-transit units (692), many of which (like orders from P17 and P18) are likely reaching the 3-period lead time mark or are delayed. I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for this consistent delay beyond the promised 2. For mu_hat, I am using recent_14 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime, and recent_14 for sigma_hat to reflect the current extreme volatility and prevent stockouts during spikes while recognizing the high holding cost of over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 24 has sustained a higher mean of ~161 units with intense volatility (max 420). Lead time is consistently reaching 3 periods in recent successful arrivals.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 11, with the average over the last 15 periods (P11-P25) being approximately 161 units, and extreme volatility peaking at 420. Recent demand in Period 25 (35 units) was low, but high spikes are frequent. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times frequently hit 3 periods, and Period 2's order was lost. Transitioning to a recent_N strategy for all parameters to capture this higher-demand, high-volatility regime. I am setting N=15 to cover the period since the last major regime shift (P11) and using L=3 explicitly to provide a buffer for the frequently observed 3-period lead time, as the OR backend's default logic is based on the promised L=2 and would under-order relative to the pipeline delay. On-hand inventory is nearly zero (2 units) with 655 units in-transit (P15 order 32, P17 order 165, P18 order 308, P21 order 41, P23 order 37 arrived, P24 order 50). Using L=3 and recent_N=15 ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat account for the (3+1) period demand window.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, the demand regime for chips(Regular) from Period 11 onwards shows a significant increase in both mean and volatility compared to the initial periods. The 16-period average from P11 to P26 is approximately 150 units, with several spikes exceeding 200 and one historical peak of 420. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 655 units, which includes orders from P15 (32), P17 (165), P18 (308), P24 (50), and P27 (scheduled). Historical lead times have demonstrated significant jitter, frequently reaching 3 periods despite a 2-period promise, and one early order (P2) was lost. Recent arrivals (P23, P25) have shown a 2-period lead time, but given the high stockout frequency and demand volatility, setting L to 3 (explicit) is safer to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent 3-period delay. mu_hat is set to the recent average (approx 150/period * (1+3)) to protect against the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=16) to capture the increased volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to 26 has sustained a higher mean of ~150 units with significant volatility (max 420).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 11) is significantly higher and more volatile than the early periods. The 17-period mean (P11-P27) is approximately 144 units, with a standard deviation of 105. Over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), demand has shown extreme spikes (e.g., 420, 263, 297). The lead time remains highly erratic, historically often hitting 3 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 655 units (largely from the massive Period 18 order of 308 units which is now 10 periods old and likely lost, similar to the Period 2 order). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high volatility, I will use a recent window (N=17) to capture the current high-demand regime while setting an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays, ensuring the OR engine builds a sufficient base stock for the 4-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Period 18 order (308 units) is likely lost (10 periods since placement, promised 2). Sustained demand regime from P11-P27 confirms an average of ~144 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 105).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 is sustained with a higher mean (~143.5) and significant volatility (std ~104.7). The lead time for chips(Regular) is frequently 3 periods, or shipments are lost entirely. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 655, but this includes 308 units from Period 18 which is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost, and 165 units from Period 17 which is 11 periods overdue and also clearly lost. Subtracting these (165+308=473) from the reported in-transit of 655 leaves 182 units actually 'expected'. Using L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time and demand mean/sigma from the recent regime (P11-P28) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers 4 periods (L+1) of high-volatility demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Period 17 order (165 units) is confirmed lost (12 periods since placement). Pipeline reconciliation: effective in-transit is 182 units (655 total - 165 lost P17 - 308 lost P18).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the account shows 0 on-hand inventory and 655 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order from Period 17 (165 units) and Period 18 (308 units) are confirmed lost (12 and 11 periods since placement, respectively). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 182 units (655 - 165 - 308). The demand regime from Period 11 to 29 indicates a mean of approximately 154 units per period with very high volatility (sigma approx 105). The actual lead time has stabilized at a mode of 3 periods (observed in most non-lost arrivals), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend accounts for these factors: 1) L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time; 2) mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean of the last 19 periods (since the regime shift at P11) to capture the higher demand level; 3) sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L)*std of the same period to account for the massive variance and protect against stockouts during this extended lead time, especially given the current 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at P30: 473 units (P17, P18) are definitively lost; effective in-transit is 182 units. Actual lead time has settled at 3 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand = 0). Demand analysis shows a sustained high-volatility regime starting around Period 11, with the most recent 20 periods (P11-P30) averaging approximately 166 units per period. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 655 units, but history strongly suggests significant losses: P17 (165 units) and P18 (308 units) are 14 and 13 periods old respectively, far exceeding the 2-period promise and the observed 3-period lead time maximum. Removing these 473 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 182 units (composed of orders from P21, P23, and P24). Given that these orders are also overdue (P21 is now 10 periods old), there's a risk of further pipeline depletion. Actual lead time has settled at 3 periods despite the 2-period promise. I will set L to an explicit 3 to account for this reality. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the higher mean and volatility while smoothing extreme outliers like the 420 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=20) to reflect the high variability (std ~105), ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock to mitigate future stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at P31: 473 units (P17, P18) are permanently lost; P21 order (41 units) and others are now significantly overdue, suggesting widening logistics failure. Recent demand regime (P11-P30) confirmed at ~166 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 11, with recent periods (P27-P31) showing extreme spikes, notably 509 units in Period 31. The average demand from Period 11 to 31 is approximately 183 units, but the last 5 periods (P27-P31) average ~267 units. This volatility (standard deviation ~145) necessitates a higher safety stock. Pipeline reconciliation shows 670 units in-transit, but 473 units (from P17 and P18) are definitively lost. Additionally, the P21 order (41 units) and P23 order (37 units) have arrived, but P24 (50 units) is now overdue (7 periods since placement), indicating a potential loss or extreme delay. The effective in-transit quantity is roughly 147 units (670 total - 473 lost - 50 likely lost). Lead time has stabilized at a mode of 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to account for this. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand/high-volatility regime and ensure the base stock is high enough to handle these sustained spikes while accounting for the significant pipeline losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Mean demand increased significantly, with P31 reaching 509 units (prev 10-period avg was ~166; new 20-period avg is ~183). Logistics failure persists: Period 24 order (50 units) is likely lost (7 periods since placement, promised 2). Effective pipeline inventory is severely reduced due to cumulative losses of P17, P18, and P24 orders (total 523 units).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely high state, notably spiked in Period 31 (509 units), though it dropped significantly in Period 32 (9 units). This level of volatility suggests a regime shift or extreme instability. Based on the last 20 periods, the average demand is approximately 183 units with a high standard deviation (\u03c3 \u2248 120). Logistics remain broken; the pipeline reconciliation shows cumulative losses from Period 17 (165), Period 18 (308), and Period 24 (50), totaling 523 units that are permanently missing. Although the 'In-transit' figure is 777, the effective 'living' pipeline is only 254 units (777 - 523). The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent modal outcome. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent upper range of delivery times and the recent logistics failures. I will set mu_hat using the last 20 samples to capture the increased mean of ~183, resulting in (1+3)*183 = 732. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 240 (sqrt(1+3) * 120) to buffer against the massive observed demand spikes (e.g., 509 units). This aggressive setting is necessary to rebuild on-hand inventory from 6 units while accounting for the high volume of lost/dead pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative logistics losses confirmed: P17 (165), P18 (308), and P24 (50) for a total of 523 units. Effective pipeline is 'Total In-transit minus 523'. Demand regime post-P31 is extremely volatile (mean ~183, spikes >500).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 31, with extreme volatility (e.g., Period 31 reaching 509 units). While recent samples (P32, P33) show a dip, the average over the last 10 active periods remains roughly 200 units, significantly higher and more varied than early stages. Logistics remain the primary challenge; cumulative confirmed losses from orders in Period 2 (100), Period 17 (165), Period 18 (308), and Period 24 (50) total 623 units. With the current reported 'In-transit' at 655 units, the effective pipeline is only 32 units (655 - 623). To account for this severe pipeline deficit and the 3-period lead time observed in most successful historical arrivals, I am setting L to 3 and using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate demand at 180 units/period, requiring a base stock that covers at least (3+1) periods (720 units). By setting mu_hat explicitly to 720, the OR backend will attempt to order up to this level minus the (largely phantom) pipeline. Note: Since the backend subtracts the full 655 in-transit units, an explicit mu_hat must be high enough to overcome this reporting error and trigger an order.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative logistics losses now total 623 units (P2: 100, P17: 165, P18: 308, P24: 50). Effective pipeline is 'Reported In-Transit minus 623'. Demand regime post-P31 is extremely volatile (mean ~183, spikes >500).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 813 units in-transit. However, cumulative logistics losses are substantial. Based on historical data, orders from P2 (100), P17 (165), P18 (308), and P24 (50) are confirmed lost, totaling 623 units. The reported in-transit of 813 includes these lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 190 units (813 - 623). Demand exhibits extreme volatility with a recent regime shift from P31: P31 (509), P32 (9), P33 (91), P34 (357). The last 4 periods average ~241 units, whereas the longer-term regime since P11 (N=24) averages ~175 units. Given the $1/$1 profit-to-holding ratio (50% service level target), the OR engine will target the mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the higher recent volatility and elevated mean (approx 190 units) while smoothing out the extreme P31 spike. For Lead Time, although it jittered to 1 recently, 3 remains the safest planning horizon given historical instability. I use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the backend base-stock calculation (1+L) covers enough future demand cycles, and I use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the true effective pipeline (it would otherwise subtract all 813 in-transit units, resulting in no new orders). Corrected mu_hat = (1+L) * expected_demand + lost_units = 4 * 190 + 623 \u2248 1383.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile and high-volume phase since Period 31, with recent demand averaging approximately 225 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35: 509, 9, 91, 357, 160). Logistics performance remains a critical concern due to cumulative lost orders (P2, P17, P18, P24 totaling 623 units). The reported in-transit inventory of 1383 units must be adjusted by subtracting these 623 lost units to reveal an effective pipeline of 760 units. While recent arrivals (P32, P33) showed a lead time of 1 period, historical data strongly suggests lead times frequently hit 3 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-volatility phase, I am setting the lead time L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum likely delay. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*225 = 900 based on the recent 5-period average. sigma_hat is set high (explicit 200) to account for extreme demand swings (e.g., P31 demand of 509).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative logistics losses confirmed at 623 units (P2: 100, P17: 165, P18: 308, P24: 50). Effective pipeline is reported In-Transit minus 623. Post-Period 31 demand average is ~225 with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 31, with a significantly higher mean (approx 235 over the last 6 periods) and high volatility (spikes over 500). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory reconciliation is critical: the reported In-transit of 1225 units includes 623 units from lost shipments (P2, P17, P18, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is 1225 - 623 = 602 units. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times are unstable, frequently reaching 3 periods. To ensure availability given the 0 on-hand status and the recent demand spike, I set L=3. I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the post-P31 demand surge (avg ~235) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std ~170). This approach targets a higher base stock to cover the logistically fragile supply chain and the increased demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 31 demand regime confirmed: mean increased to ~235 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 170). Cumulative logistical losses remain at 623 units (P2, P17, P18, P24), making the effective pipeline heavily discounted from the reported in-transit figure.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted at Period 31, with a high mean of approximately 235 units and significant volatility (standard deviation ~170). The lead time remains erratic, but recent successful arrivals (P34 and P35) arrived in 2 periods, while the long-term observation frequently hits 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 655 units includes 623 units from orders (P2, P17, P18, P24) that are definitively lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 32 units. To prevent stockouts against a volatile 235-unit demand mean and a 2-3 period lead time, I will set L to 3 (the safer, dominant lead time) and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7 to capture the post-P31 regime) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and recent volume increase.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-P31 demand regime: mean 235, high volatility (std ~170). Total cumulative logistics losses remain at 623 units (P2, P17, P18, P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has shifted significantly, with a mean of approximately 235 units and very high volatility (std ~170). The delivery environment is characterized by severe logistical losses. Accumulating the losses noted in history: Period 2 (100), Period 17 (165), Period 18 (308), and Period 24 (50), we have 623 units reported in the 'In-transit' figure (655 units) that are effectively lost. This leaves only 32 units of viable pipeline inventory. With on-hand inventory at 144 units and the next few periods' expected demand totaling over 470 units (based on a mean of 235 and L=2), the current inventory position is precarious. I am setting L to the promised 2 periods to encourage the OR engine to order, but I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P31 demand regime (Mean=235, Volatility=170). Calculating mu_hat as (1+L)*mean = 3*235 = 705. For sigma_hat, using sqrt(3)*170 approx 294. This should trigger an order to replenish the safety stock and offset the lost pipeline units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40. The demand regime starting Period 31 has shown a significant increase in mean and high volatility, with a calculated average of approximately 235 units. The cumulative logistics losses have stabilized at 623 units (specifically orders from P2, P17, P18, and P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is the reported In-transit (655) minus these lost units (623), which equals only 32 units. With on-hand inventory at 0, we have an effective total inventory of only 32 units against a demand regime of ~235 units per period. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods despite the promise of 2. Therefore, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the realistic 3-period delay. I am setting mu_hat to (1+3)*235 = 940 to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period, and sigma_hat to explicit 340 (which is sqrt(1+3) * 170) to account for the high volatility observed since Period 31. This should trigger a substantial order to replenish the stock and address the current deficit caused by logistics failures.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has settled into a higher-mean, high-volatility phase with an average demand of ~226 units and a standard deviation of ~171. The current period (P41) has 0 on-hand inventory. The total reported 'In-transit' is 940 units; however, historical analysis confirms a cumulative loss of 623 units (P2: 100, P17: 165, P18: 308, P24: 50). Furthermore, orders from P21 (41 units) and P23 (37 units) are also extremely overdue and likely lost, making the effective pipeline even thinner. The OR backend's capped policy uses current 'In-transit' in its calculation (base_stock - pipeline), so I must adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this 'ghost' inventory. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence (N=10), I capture the current high-demand state. I choose L=3 (explicit) because, while the promised lead time is 2, 3 periods has been the consistent operational reality for successful larger deliveries in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed cumulative logistics losses: 623 units (P2, P17, P18, P24). Demand regime post-P31: mean ~226, std ~171. Lead time effectively 3 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) post-Period 31 is characterized by a high mean (~226) and significant volatility (std ~171). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported in-transit is 940 units, but based on historical analysis, 623 units are definitively lost (P2, P17, P18, P24). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 317 units (940 - 623). An order of 285 was placed in P40, which is expected to arrive in P43 given the standard 3-period lead time observed recently. To ensure coverage against the current high-demand volatility (\u03c3 ~170) and recognizing that the current effective pipeline is thin relative to the demand spikes (up to 509), I am setting L to 3 (recent dominant mode) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the post-P31 regime specifically.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 940 units, but we must account for confirmed cumulative logistics losses of 623 units (P2, P17, P18, P24). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 317 units (940 - 623). Current demand remains in the high-volatility regime established after Period 31, with a mean demand of approximately 226 and high standard deviation (approx 171). Lead time for successful arrivals consistently reaches 3 periods, so I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the post-P31 regime behavior while balancing historical volatility. The backend will compute a base stock to cover the expected demand and buffer for the high variance, then subtract the effective pipeline (which my L and mu_hat choices compensate for) to determine the order.

However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 623 units (P2: 100, P17: 165, P18: 308, P24: 50) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 32 units (655 - 623). The demand regime post-Period 31 is characterized by a mean of approximately 226 units per period and high volatility (Std Dev ~171). The actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in the most recent arrival from Period 40). To ensure availability for upcoming demand given the high volatility and logistics unreliable nature, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=3. For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * 226 = 904. For sigma_hat, I use sqrt(1+L) * 171 \u2248 342. These parameters will prompt the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for the 3-period lead time and the recent significant demand level and variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we observe an on-hand inventory of 104 units and a reported in-transit of 655 units. Based on historical data (Carry-over insights), 623 units from Period 2, 17, 18, and 24 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 32 units (655 - 623), which corresponds to orders placed after Period 24 that have not yet arrived. The lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently for non-lost shipments like P40 arriving in P43). The demand regime since Period 31 has shown a significant increase in both mean and volatility. Calculating the mean for the post-P31 regime (P31 to P44), we find an average of approximately 219 units per period with a standard deviation of 152. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over (L+1) periods, but volatility necessitates a higher buffer to avoid stockouts in this high-demand phase. I will set L=3, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the regime since Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 31 demand regime confirmed: mean ~219, std ~152. Effective pipeline inventory calculation remains 'Reported In-Transit minus 623' due to persistent historical losses. Observed lead time is stable at 3 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows Period 46 with on-hand inventory at 0. Since Period 31, a higher demand regime has stabilized with a mean around 219 and standard deviation around 152. However, the last 4 periods (P42-P45) show a slightly lower but highly volatile localized mean (213, 17, 164, 292). Logistics tracking reveals 623 units are definitively lost (P2, P17, P18, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 715 (reported) - 623 (lost) = 92 units. The OR backend needs to account for the actual lead time of 3 periods and the sustained demand shift that occurred at P31. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the post-P31 regime context (P31-P45) while ensuring the lead time L is set to reflect the actual dominant behavior of 3 periods discovered in historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 31 has been highly volatile with a mean of ~219 units and standard deviation of ~152. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit is 842 units, but we must account for cumulative historical losses of 623 units (from Periods 2, 17, 18, and 24), leaving an effective pipeline of 219 units. Our objective is to set parameters that cover demand over the lead time (L=2 promised, but L=3 is the frequent reality) plus the review period. Given the high volatility and recent zero inventory resulting in lost sales, I will use a 16-period sample (recent_N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P31 regime accurately. For the lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method to let the backend average observed performance, acknowledging that while L=3 is common, recent hits have been 2 or 3 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The demand regime post-Period 31 is characterized by a mean of approx 210-220 units with significant volatility. Recent demand has slowed (P46=22, P47=0), but historical patterns suggest this could be a temporary lull. The cumulative logistics losses remain at 623 units (P2, P17, P18, P24). The current reported 'In-transit' is 842. Subtracting the 623 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 219 units. These units correspond to orders from P45 (60 units) and P46 (127 units), and potentially P32 (though P32 should have arrived given it was ordered 16 periods ago; if 122 units from P32 are also lost, the effective pipeline is only 187 units). Observed lead time is consistently 3 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory at 0, we must ensure enough stock arrives by P49/P50. Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat to a recent 15-period average (recent_N=15) to capture the higher Post-P31 demand regime while accounting for the recent zero-demand periods. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N=15 to reflect the high volatility (approx 170).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the game is nearing its end (Period 50). The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit is 842 units. However, historical evidence confirms a cumulative loss of 623 units (Orders from P2, P17, P18, and P24). Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 219 units (842 - 623), which consists of orders from P45 (60 units) and P46 (127 units), plus potentially others. Since the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods, the P45 order placed at the start of P45 is expected to arrive during P48 and be visible at the start of P49 (but it hasn't arrived yet based on the P48 conclude, implying it might arrive during P49). The P46 order is expected during P49. Given the significant demand volatility (mean ~219, std ~152 post-P31) and the fact that there is only one period remaining after this decision, I will set L to 3 (the settled actual lead time) and use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime. Setting N=18 covers the period from P31 to P48. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand observed recently while acknowledging the logistics delay.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. Historical data indicates a significant demand regime shift around Period 31, with subsequent demand showing high volatility and a mean of approximately 220. Logistics have been unreliable: orders from Periods 2, 17, 18, and 24 (totaling 623 units) are confirmed lost. The reported in-transit of 842 units, when adjusted for these losses, leaves an effective pipeline of 219 units. Our current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods in recent successful cycles. To avoid stockouts in this high-volatility environment (max demand seen >500) and considering the effective lead time L+1, I am using an explicit forecast for demand and lead time. mu_hat is set to (3+1) * 220 = 880. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(4) * 160 = 320 to manage the high variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Final context at Period 50: Demand regime post-P31 is ~220/period with high volatility (std ~160). Cumulative confirmed logistical losses (lost shipments) total 623 units (P2, P17, P18, P24). Actual lead time is effectively 3 periods.
