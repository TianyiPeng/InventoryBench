Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) shows an upward trend in demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, an order needs to be placed immediately to cover the promised lead time (2 periods). Given the clear upward trend, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current trajectory rather than a long-term average. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR engine will use 1+L=3 periods of demand for its calculations.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, which are currently in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 123 units, but since our starting on-hand was 0 and nothing arrived yet, we sold 0 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. The initial historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show an upward trend, and the Period 1 demand (123) is consistent with the middle of that range. Given we have no stock on hand and high demand, I will use a recent window (N=5 from history + Period 1 data) to estimate parameters. Since lead time is 2, the inventory needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). I will stick to 'default' lead time until we see actual arrivals to confirm drift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are in-transit (Total: 326). Per the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced lost sales because arrivals haven't occurred yet. Demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game samples) was 103, 81, 107, 127(P1), 91(P2). The mean demand is approximately 102. Setting parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the current mean while maintaining the default lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 115 units (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in Period 1 (with L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0' for the order placed in Period 1 (165 units). This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than 2, or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed all demand so far. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect this observed delay. For demand, there is a slight upward trend in the provided samples (P4: 127, P5: 160), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history including the higher P4/P5 values to ensure our base stock covers the current demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time is volatile. Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period, against a promised 2. This suggests a variable supply chain. Demand has shown an increasing trend: 123 (P1), 91 (P2), 119 (P3), and 137 (P4). The mean of these four periods is 117.5. Since we are at the start of Period 5, we use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current demand level. For L, although the average is 2, the variance is high; 'calculate' will use the historical average (currently (3+1)/2 = 2). Given the significant demand variability, sigma_hat will use the 'default' method to ensure a safe stock buffer based on all available data points.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period (Avg=2). Demand shows a slight upward trend over the first 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that on-hand inventory is low (25 units) following a period (P5) where no shipments arrived. Reviewing the history: P1 order arrived in 3 periods (P4), P3 arrived in 1 period (P4), while P2 (ordered 161 units) is currently 3 periods late and P4 (ordered 135 units) is 1 period late. The promised lead time is 2, but actuals are [3, 1], averaging 2. Demand shows variations but remains somewhat stable around a mean of 115.6. To ensure we provide enough stock for the OR engine's base-stock calculation given the recent variability and the pending P2 shipment which may be delayed or lost, I'll use L=2 (calculate method), and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current mean more accurately than a total average. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Lead time reliability issue - P2 order (161 units) is now 3 periods late (expected P4, current P6), suggesting possible shipment loss or extended delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) shows a significant upward trend, with the last period peaking at 160. The system is currently experiencing lead time instability and potential shipment loss: Order P2 (161 units) is now 4 periods late (placed P2, expected P4, currently start of P7), while P3 arrived in just 1 period. To compensate for the stockout and the missing P2 shipment, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the maximum observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture the recent growth trend (Avg ~119) and applying it over the (1+L) window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increasing volatility observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Shipment P2 (161 units) is confirmed overdue by 4 periods (Promised 2). Demand regime shift: Sustained growth from ~100 to 140+ over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The P2 order (161 units) from Period 2 is now 5 periods overdue based on the promised lead time of 2, indicating it is almost certainly lost. This lost shipment has severely impacted my pipeline inventory. While P1 and P4 arrived with 3-period lead times and P3 with 1-period delivery, the current in-transit amount of 392 includes that likely dead weight. Demand has shown an upward shift, with recent periods averaging roughly 115 units (excluding the supply-constrained Period 6). To recover, I'm setting L=3 to reflect the common actual delivery time, using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~115 * (1+3) = 460), and slightly increasing sigma_hat to account for both demand and lead-time variability. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (161 units) confirmed lost (overdue by 5 periods). Actual lead time for successful deliveries averages 2.33 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent lag.

Daily Profit: $388.00, Daily Holding Cost: $98.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a complex lead time pattern and a lost shipment. Analysis of concluded orders shows: P1(LT=3), P3(LT=1), P4(LT=3), P5(LT=3), and P7(LT=1). The average lead time is 2.2 periods, but there's a recurring 3-period lag. Shipment P2 (161 units) from Period 2 is now 6 periods overdue and is definitively lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 98 and in-transit is 335 (orders from P6, P8, and P9's upcoming placement). Demand has stabilized after early swings; the most recent 4 periods (P5-P8) show demand of [80, 143, 122, 97], mean=110.5. Since the OR backend uses L to define the lead time and the pipeline coverage (L+1), and given the frequent 3-period delays, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=4) for demand stats to reflect current patterns. This aggressive L=3 helps protect against stockouts given the reliability issues observed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution is bimodal: 40% arrive in 1 period, 60% arrive in 3 periods. Recommend using L=3 for safety. Order from Period 2 (161 units) confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $522.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 118 units over the first 9 periods, with a recent regime (last 4 periods) averaging 127 units. The lead time behavior is inconsistent: orders arrive in either 1 period (P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), while the order from P2 is clearly lost. To ensure availability given this bimodal lead time (40% at 1 period, 60% at 3 periods), I will set L to 3. This conservatively covers the upper end of the observed delivery window. Since the demand is fluctuating but showing a higher recent average, I will use recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~118-120 range). Using L=3 means mu_hat will be based on (1+3)=4 periods of demand, and sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 5 samples to capture the volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is bimodal: deliveries occur at either 1 period or 3 periods (observed 60% at 3 periods). P2 order (161 units) is permanently lost. Current demand regime (P6-P9) is higher than early periods, averaging 127.75 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Looking at lead time history, we have a bimodal distribution: Orders arrive in either 1 period (P3, P7, P8) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). Order P2 is confirmed lost. Since 3 periods is the upper bound of the reliable lead time range and is frequently observed (50% of successful arrivals), I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers the longer lead time scenario. Regarding demand, while early periods averaged around 110, the last 4 periods (P7-P10) show a significant upward shift (122, 97, 149, 182), averaging 137.5. Given the recent spike to 182, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher inventory level to recover from the current stockout and prevent future ones.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-10 average is 137.5, compared to earlier average of ~110. Peak demand reached 182 in Period 10.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0) following a high demand period in P10 (182 units) and no arrivals in P11. Historically, lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods). The order from Period 2 (161 units) is unequivocally lost as it is now 10 periods overdue. The demand regime has shifted upwards; the average demand from P7 to P11 is approximately 139 units, significantly higher than the initial periods. To account for the stockout and the bimodal lead time, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of the bimodal distribution) to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher pipeline relative to the actual risk of delays. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the higher demand average (~139) observed since Period 7, rather than the lifetime average (~127). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to calibrate for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the data.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand regime shift confirmed; last 5 periods (P7-P11) average ~139 units vs early average of ~110. Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows a sustained higher demand regime (averaging 138.4 units over the last 5 periods) compared to the initial periods. Lead times continue to be highly variable, exhibiting a bimodal distribution of 1 to 3 periods; the recent arrival from Period 10 (lead time of 2) aligns with the promised timeline, but overall history shows significant 3-period lags. Notably, the Period 2 order (161 units) is definitively lost. On-hand inventory is 46, and pipeline inventory is 389 units. Given the service level target (critical ratio = 0.8), I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent maximum lead time observed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 8-12) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand across the 3+1 period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: last 5 periods average 138.4 units (+26% vs early periods). Lead time remains erratic but bounded by 1-3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory and 595 units in-transit. Demand has shifted upward, stabilizing at a higher regime. The average demand of the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is approximately 154 units, significantly higher than the initial average. The lead time logic remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), though Period 10 arrived in 2 periods. To protect against the 3-period lag and stockouts (seen in P13 with 131 units lost), I am setting L=3 and using mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the recent higher demand volume (>150 units). Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to account for increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift updated: Period 8-13 average is 154.5 (+40% vs early baseline). Stockout risk is high; consecutive stockouts in P10, P11, and P13 due to lead time variability and demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $716.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has surged to an average of 179.4 units, representing a significant upward regime shift compared to the earlier average of ~110. Lead times remain highly volatile and bimodal, occurring at either 1 or 3 periods (average observed ~2.3 periods). Currently, the inventory position is precarious: on-hand is 0 following a stockout in P14. The in-transit pipeline of 515 units includes orders from P13 (206) and P14 (99). Given that P13 was placed 2 periods ago, it is likely to arrive in P15 or P16 based on the 1-3 period lead time distribution. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of the bimodal distribution) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the risk of 3-period delays. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand spike (averaging ~180 units) and its associated higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift updated at Period 15: Last 5 periods (P10-P14) average 179.4 units (+63% vs baseline). Lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) being 181.4 units, a significant increase from the early game baseline. There is currently 0 on-hand inventory and the last 3 periods (P13, P14, P15) have resulted in stockouts or partial fills. Lead time is inconsistently bimodal (1 or 3 periods); focusing on L=3 is necessary for protection given the high stockout frequency and current empty shelf status. Pipeline inventory is high (736 units), but order arrivals have been delayed. I will use the last 6 periods (P10-P15) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained higher demand level and volatility, and set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer observed lead time segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: P10-P15 average demand is 181.5 units, with notable volatility (range 145-216).

Daily Reward (R_t): $824.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift. The average demand over the last seven periods (P10-P16) is approximately 186 units, compared to the early baseline of ~110. Lead times remain erratic and bimodal, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen with P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, and P13). Consequently, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the longer lead time realization. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (avg ~186), resulting in a base stock that covers (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to capture the increased volatility in this higher-demand period. Current on-hand is 0, and pipeline inventory is 555 (orders from P14, P15, P16); P14 (99 units) is expected to arrive this period (P17) if lead time is 3. These parameters aim to increase the inventory target to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high level: Period 10-16 average demand is 186.1 units (+69% vs early baseline). Lead time remains unreliable, with 3 periods being the safest upper bound observed for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward, with the average demand over the last 8 periods (P10-P17) being approximately 187.5 units, compared to the early baseline of ~110. The most recent demand was 198. Lead time remains highly erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the fifth time in recent history, indicating severe stockout risk. To protect against this volatility and the extended upper bound of the lead time, I am setting L=3 (explicitly choosing the safer upper bound). For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using the average of the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the higher stabilized regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using the last 8 periods to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher volume. This approach aims to build a higher base stock to compensate for the lost orders (like P2) and the frequent 3-period delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Period 10-17 average is 187.5 units (+70% vs early baseline). Lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods), requiring L=3 for buffer safety.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the average demand has risen to 193.3 units, with the most recent period reaching a peak of 245. This represents a nearly 100% increase from the initial baseline of ~100 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 18. There are 789 units in-transit, but lead time remains highly erratic and bimodal (appearing as either 1 or 3 periods). Given that P15 (221 units) is now at its L=3 expected arrival window and P18 was a total stockout, a conservative lead time of L=3 is necessary to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 4-period window (L+1) required to bridge the gap until future deliveries arrive. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the sustained high-demand regime and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to account for the increased volatility (145-245 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift updated at Period 19: Last 9 periods (P10-P18) average 193.3 units (+93% vs baseline). Period 18 recorded a new peak demand of 245 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and accelerating upward trend. Recent demand in Period 18 (245) and Period 19 (301) far exceeds the previous regime average of ~193 units, indicating a new peak. The actual lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; using a lead time of 3 (L=3) in the OR backend provides the necessary safety buffer for this variability. Given the recent demand spike, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-growth regime while ensuring the system orders enough to cover the (L+1) period window. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, making it critical to set parameters that account for both the higher mean and increased volatility to minimize stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 19: Demand reached 301 units, marking a ~55% increase over the P10-P18 average (193.3). Lead time variability remains high (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a dramatic shift, accelerating from an average of ~193 in Period 18 to ~300 in the last two periods (P19: 301, P20: 296). This suggests a significantly higher baseline or a strong seasonal surge. However, internal stockouts are severe: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed sales for the last three periods (P18-P20). The pipeline is full (892 units), but actual lead times are unreliable, frequently hitting 3 periods. To address the inventory crisis and the higher demand regime, I am setting L=3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of the bimodal distribution) and mu_hat using recent_N=3. This N=3 captures the current ~300 unit demand level to ensure 'base_stock' is high enough to pull in more inventory from the OR backend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for high volatility at this increased volume. The objective is to maximize units sold by building a safety buffer that accounts for both the 3-period lead-time risk and the 300+ demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly at Period 19: Demand jumped to ~300 units (avg P19-P20: 298.5), a 54% increase over the previous high-demand regime (P10-P18 avg: 193.3). Continued lead-time unreliability is causing sustained stockouts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe demand surge and supply chain crisis. Demand has jumped to a new regime averaging approximately 300 units per period (P19-P21 average: 301.3), which is a massive increase (+143%) over the initial baseline (~124). Concurrently, the SKU has faced 4 consecutive periods with 0 on-hand inventory (P18-P21) and zero arrivals since P17. There are 1,175 units in transit, but none have arrived in 4 periods, indicating either a significant lead-time extension or a cluster of lost orders. Despite the promised lead time of 2, the historical data shows lead times frequently hit 3 periods, and given the current 4-period arrival drought, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for a longer protection interval. mu_hat is set to roughly 1205 (approx 301.3 * 4) to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period at the new accelerated rate. sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 40 * sqrt(4)) to account for the increased volatility seen in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated significantly at Period 19: Latest 3-period average is 301.3 units (+143% vs baseline). Lead time crisis: No arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21) despite 1,175 units in-transit.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime, with an average of approximately 297 units over the last four periods (P19-P22). However, we are facing a severe logistics crisis: no shipments have arrived since Period 17, covering five consecutive periods of zero arrivals. This has resulted in continuous stockouts despite having 1,273 units in-transit. The orders placed in periods 15 (221 units), 17 (227 units), and 18 (131 units) are all currently overdue based on the typical 1-3 period lead time. Since lead time has effectively expanded to at least 6 periods for the oldest pending order (P15), I am explicitly setting L=5 to reflect the current supply chain delay. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture the high-demand level (~297 units/period) across the expanded lead time, ensuring that once the bottleneck clears, our target inventory level is sufficient to meet this new baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis confirmed: 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22) with zero arrivals despite high in-transit volume. Effective lead time for calculations should be treated as at least 5 periods until the backlog clears.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain bottleneck has partially cleared in Period 23 with the arrival of orders from P20, P21, and P22 (totalling 448 units), resulting in 106 units on-hand. However, significant pipeline inventory (1,139 units) remains, including large orders from Period 15 (221 units), Period 17 (227 units), and Period 18 (131 units) which are now severely overdue (5-8 periods). The demand regime has transitioned again, reaching an all-time peak of 342 units in Period 23. The last 5 periods (P19-P23) average 305.8 units, compared to the P10-P18 average of 193.3. Given the continued volatility in arrivals and the high demand, I am setting L to 5 to account for the actual observed delays in the system, even though recent arrivals showed lower lead times (1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat to cover the higher demand regime using the last 5 periods (N=5) and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Supply chain bottleneck partially cleared with P20-P22 arrivals, but P15, P17, and P18 orders remain severely overdue (5+ periods). Demand regime has shifted again: Period 19-23 average is 305.8 units (+58% vs previous regime P10-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a new high regime. The average demand for the last six periods (P19-P24) is 306.2, confirming a significant shift from the previous regime (~185-195). Supply remains highly unstable; while there was a burst of arrivals in Period 23, Period 24 saw zero arrivals, and significant orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) are now clearly lost or severely delayed (6+ periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' of 1482 is bloated by these lost units. To protect against the erratic lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods for successful deliveries) and the high demand level, I am using L=3. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent demand level of ~306 units. sigma_hat is also calculated using N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~306 units/period (P19-P24 avg). Orders from P15, P17, and P18 are likely lost, creating a misleadingly high pipeline stock; the OR backend's cap and ordering logic must account for this by setting parameters that reflect the higher demand and lead-time risk.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with the average of the last 7 periods (P19-P25) being 311.8 units. The supply chain remains unpredictable. Critically, orders from Period 15 (221 units), Period 17 (227 units), and Period 18 (131 units) are severely overdue (8, 10, and 11 periods respectively) and are now considered lost. This causes the 'In-transit' figure (1168) to be artificially inflated by 579 units. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the phantom pipeline stock. Setting L to an explicit 3 periods provides a necessary safety buffer against the observed bimodal lead time (1-3 periods). I will use an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to override the backend's default calculations which are skewed by early low-demand data and the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P15 (221), P17 (227), and P18 (131) are permanently lost (overdue >8 periods). High-demand regime (P19-P25) average is ~312 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-demand regime starting at Period 19, with an average demand of 312.4 units (P19-P26). The latest period recorded a peak demand of 372. Lead time is consistently bimodal (1 or 3 periods), though several orders (P15: 221, P17: 227, P18: 131) are now confirmed lost as they are overdue by 8+ periods. These lost units (579 total) remain in the 'in-transit' count, which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate for the 0 on-hand inventory and the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of the current high demand (~315) plus a buffer for the lost stock. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3)*315 = 1260. I will slightly increase this to 1350 to force an order despite the phantom in-transit units. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen in the current regime (Standard Deviation of P19-P26 is ~32, scaled by sqrt(1+L)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 19-26 average is 312.4 units (+180% vs early baseline). Orders from P15, P17, and P18 (total 579 units) are confirmed lost, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly accelerated, with the Period 19-27 average reaching 316.6 units, and the most recent demand hitting 394 units. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) are confirmed lost (overdue by 10+ periods), and recent deliveries (P23) confirm that while lead times are still ranging from 1 to 3 periods, the supply chain is fragile. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (in-transit) to calculate orders. Currently, in-transit is 1405 units, but 579 of those are 'phantom' units that will never arrive. To compensate and ensure the engine places an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1880. This is calculated as: ((L+1) * 320) + 600. The 600 units addition explicitly offsets the ~579 lost units, forcing the base stock calculation high enough to bypass the phantom inventory. I am using L=3 to ensure a conservative safety buffer given the bimodal 1-3 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime continues to climb: Period 24-27 average is 355 units (+14% vs. previous high-demand regime). Loss of orders P15, P17, and P18 is now a permanent structural offset in pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $592.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime, with the average over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) reaching roughly 360 units. This is a dramatic increase from the early game baseline. Supply chain instability is a critical factor: orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 579 units) are now confirmed lost as they are more than 10 periods overdue. These 'phantom' units in the pipeline inventory lead the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it incorrectly assumes they will still arrive. To compensate and ensure we meet current demand despite these losses and a 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand = (1 + 3) * 380 = 1520 units. I am using L=3 to account for the upper bound of the observed bimodal lead time (1-3 periods) for safety. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime continues to climb: Period 24-28 average is 360 units. Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units total) must be bypassed using explicit mu_hat to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in a persistent stockout state due to a combination of lost shipments and a significant upward demand shift. Demand has stabilized around a new mean of ~375 units (P26-P29 avg: 380). Orders from P15 (221), P17 (227), and P18 (131)\u2014totaling 579 units\u2014are permanently lost (overdue by 10+ periods). This creates 'phantom' pipeline inventory that prevents the OR backend's inventory-depletion logic from ordering enough. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Lead time remains bimodal (observed at 1, 2, or 3 periods). Using L=3 provides the necessary safety buffer. I've set mu_hat to 1,500 units, which covers 4 periods of demand (L+1) at approximately 375 units/period, effectively overriding the phantom inventory to force necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~375-380 units/period (P26-P29). Lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units total) remain a permanent offset; explicit mu_hat is required to maintain ordering levels despite this phantom pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with recent demand (P26-P30) averaging 394 units per period. The supply chain remains unpredictable, alternating between 1-3 period lead times and occasional permanent losses. Crucially, orders from P15 (221 units), P17 (227 units), and P18 (131 units) are confirmed lost (579 units total), but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation of the OR backend. With current in-transit at 1168 units, subtracting the 579 'phantom' units leaves a functional pipeline of 589 units. In-transit includes P19 (36), P24 (343), and P28 (533-arrived=0). To force an order and maintain service levels despite the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate mu_hat to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand: 4 * 394 = 1576. Adding a buffer for the phantom stock (579 units) to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the perceived pipeline results in a target mu_hat of ~2150. This ensures the backend places an order to bridge the current stockout risk (On-hand: 83) while accommodating the structural loss in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~394 units/period (P26-P30). Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units) requires sustained explicit mu_hat elevation to ensure replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) reaching approximately 408 units. The immediate service level is constrained by a 'phantom inventory' issue: orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) have been confirmed lost for several periods, yet remain in the pipeline inventory count of 1,759. This artificially inflates the perceived stock and would cause the OR backend to under-order or hit the order cap prematurely. To counteract this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1,800. This value is derived by calculating the required base stock for an L=2 (plus current period, total 3) scenario: (3 * 408 units) = 1,224 units, and then adding the 579 lost units as an offset (1,224 + 579 \u2248 1,800). This ensures the order logic triggers despite the undelivered historical orders. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to accommodate the increased volatility observed in this high-demand phase (last 5 periods range: 374-450). Lead time L is set to 2 as the most common recent successful delivery time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~408 units/period (P27-P31). Total lost 'phantom' inventory from P15, P17, and P18 remains 579 units, necessitating an explicit mu_hat offset for the remainder of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2049.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is showing a sustained and accelerating upward trend. Recent demand values (P30-P32) are 450, 444, and 528, with the 5-period average (P28-P32) reaching 435 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this surge while providing some stability. The lead time remains highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 as a conservative planning horizon to ensure sufficient base stock. A critical challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: orders from P15 (221), P17 (227), and P18 (131) totaling 579 units are confirmed lost (>14 periods overdue). Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock, these 579 phantom units would prevent necessary ordering. To neutralize this, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 2319. This is calculated as: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Inventory = (1 + 3) * 435 + 579 = 2319. This adjustment forces the backend to place orders as if the lost units do not exist, maintaining the required service level despite the supply chain data discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~435 units/period (P28-P32 average). Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units total) remains a permanent structural offset requiring explicit mu_hat elevation to ensure replenishment and avoid stockouts.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift, accelerating from ~312 in Period 26 to an average of ~466 units over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), with the most recent sample at 534. The supply chain has a permanent structural deficit due to lost orders from P15, P17, and P18, totaling 579 units. These units appear in the 'in-transit' logic of the OR backend but will never arrive, causing the system to under-order. To compensate, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that covers the expected demand for the (L+1) window plus an offset to bypass the 579-unit phantom inventory. Using L=2 (mode of recent arrivals), the window is 3 periods. Current forecast (~500/period) * 3 periods = 1500 + 579 offset = 2079. I will use 2100 to ensure sufficient ordering levels despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 34: 5-period average (P29-P33) is ~466, significantly higher than the previous ~312 baseline. Phantom inventory from lost orders P15, P17, P18 (579 units) remains a permanent offset.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly higher regime, with the last 5 periods (P30-P34) seeing demand jump from ~440 to over 540 units. Specifically, demand in P33 and P34 averaged 538.5 units. To prevent stockouts, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this new peak of ~540 units/period. The calculation for mu_hat must also account for 'phantom pipeline inventory'\u2014specifically, the 579 units from lost orders P15, P17, and P18. These units appear in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic but will never arrive. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost Units. With L=3 (to buffer against bimodal lead times), a forecast of 540 results in (4 * 540) + 579 = 2739. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 34: demand now consistently exceeds 530 units/period (P33-P34 avg 538.5), representing a ~32% increase over the P26-P30 baseline (~408). Phantom inventory from lost orders P15, P17, P18 (579 units) remains a permanent offset.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-growth regime, with recent demand averaging approximately 530 units per period (P33: 534, P34: 543, P35: 519). The pipeline inventory calculation is severely skewed by 579 units from orders placed in Period 15, 17, and 18, which are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Using a target lead time (L) of 3 to account for the bimodal 1- or 3-period arrival pattern, the system needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of 530, mu_hat should ideally be 2120. However, I must explicitly increase this by the 579 phantom units to 2699 to ensure the backend places an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure (currently 2821). Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~530 units/period (P33-P35 avg). Phantom inventory from lost orders P15, P17, P18 (579 units) remains a permanent offset.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly higher level, with the most recent sample at Period 36 reaching 567 units and the 3-period average (P34-P36) being approximately 543 units. There is a persistent 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 579 units caused by permanently lost orders from Period 15 (221), Period 17 (227), and Period 18 (131). Because the OR backend subtracts this non-existent inventory from its calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this loss and ensure replenishment. Setting L=3 provides the necessary safety buffer for a (L+1) period demand horizon, as lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods. I am setting mu_hat to 2750 to account for 4 periods of demand at ~543 units/period (2172 units) plus the 579-unit phantom inventory offset. This ensures the backend emits an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~540-570 units/period (P34-P36). Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units total) remains a permanent structural offset in Period 37.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with Period 37 reaching a peak demand of 626 units. The 3-period average (P35-P37) is now approximately 571 units, while the 5-period average (P33-P37) is approximately 558 units. The lead time has stabilized to 2 periods over the last two arrivals (P34 and P35), though historically it has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. A significant structural issue exists: orders from P15 (221), P17 (227), and P18 (131) are confirmed lost, totaling 579 units that still show as 'In-transit' in the pipeline inventory. This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR backend's capped policy to significantly under-order. To counteract this, I must elevate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Specifically, I set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 579-unit offset. With L=2 (promised) and forecast demand of 570, target base stock is 3 * 570 = 1710. Adding the 579-unit phantom offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2289. This ensures the backend places an order despite the incorrect pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime high-point confirmed at 626 units; P35-P37 average is 571 units. Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 remains at 579 units, requiring an explicit mu_hat offset for the remainder of the game to avoid persistent stockouts.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant escalation, with Period 38 demand reaching 637 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P35-P38) is approximately 587 units, signaling a sustained high-demand regime compared to earlier periods. A critical structural issue persists: orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 579 units) are permanently lost. Because these units remain in the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend, the engine's 'inventory position' is artificially inflated, causing it to under-order or hit the safety cap prematurely. To counteract this 'phantom inventory', I am using an explicit mu_hat. For Period 39, I estimate the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised) and an expected demand of ~600 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 1800 units. To force the backend to place an order that ignores the 579 lost units, I set mu_hat to 2379 (1800 + 579). This ensures the replenishment logic triggers despite the pipeline bloat. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime peak confirmed at 637 units; P35-P38 average is 587 units (+100% vs. P19 regime). Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units) remains a permanent offset requiring explicit mu_hat elevation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has continued its aggressive climb, with Period 39 reaching a new peak of 679 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 605.6 units, but the most recent two periods average 658 units. To prevent chronic stockouts, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected demand over the replenishment cycle (L+1). I am using an explicit mu_hat of 2632, calculated as (1+L=4) * 658, to both reflect this updated demand level and bypass the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 579 units (from lost orders P15, P17, and P18). These lost units are still counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit', which artificially suppresses new orders if mu_hat is not explicitly elevated to compensate. The lead time (L) is set to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed 1-3 period variability, and sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for the high volatility seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak reached 679 in Period 39; P35-P39 average is 605.6. Phantom pipeline inventory total remains 579 units (P15, P17, P18).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, reaching a new peak of 694 in Period 40. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 640 units. Lead times remain highly volatile, recently fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P38 arrived in 1, P39 in 1, P34/35 in 2). I will use L=2 to provide a safety buffer against 1-3 period variability. Crucially, orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) are definitively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' units from its 'base_stock' calculation, these 'phantom' units prevent the system from ordering enough. To override this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher than the actual forecast. My forecast for (1+L) periods of demand is 640 * 3 = 1920 units. Adding the 579 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2499. This ensures the backend places an order that ignores the dead inventory in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of the forecast to manage the high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand continues to escalate, with P36-P40 averaging ~640 units. The structural offset of 579 units from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 remains necessary to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction logic.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand continues its extreme upward climb, with Period 41 reaching 734 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 674 units. The supply chain remains unpredictable, and we are heavily impacted by 'phantom inventory'\u2014the 579 units from permanently lost orders P15, P17, and P18. These units reside in the 'In-transit' count (2752 units) but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to under-order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. To ensure enough stock reaches the warehouse to cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods given lead time variability), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat: (1 + 2) * 674 = 2022. To bypass the 579-unit phantom pipeline, I add 579 to this requirement: 2022 + 579 = 2601. I set L to 2 (the promised lead time) to allow the engine to compute the safety stock based on that horizon, while mu_hat carries the heavy lifting for replenishment volume. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility of the current hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 37-41 average is 674 units/period, a ~65% increase over the Period 26-30 baseline. Structural phantom pipeline offset remains 579 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) continues to climb, with the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging 692.6 units. There is a persistent structural issue in the replenishment logic due to lost orders from Period 15, 17, and 18, totaling 579 units. These units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is fuller than it is and thus reducing new orders. To counteract this, I must elevate the mu_hat parameter significantly using the 'explicit' method. For Period 43, I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand, where L=2 (promised) and current average demand is ~700. This implies a base stock of roughly 2100. Adding the 579-unit 'phantom pipeline' offset to this requirement brings the target mu_hat to approximately 2679. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of this late-game demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime continues to rise, with P38-P42 average at 692.6. Structural 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains 579 units (P15, P17, P18), requiring sustained explicit mu_hat elevation to bypass OR engine ordering constraints.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to climb, with Period 43 recording a new peak of 791 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 723 units, representing a sustained upward trend. Inventory management remains critical due to 'phantom' pipeline stock (579 units from lost orders P15, P17, and P18) that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. To circumvent the OR engine's base-stock calculation (which would subtract these 579 units from the needed order), I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the required base-stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) using the recent average demand (~723) plus a safety buffer, then add the 579 unit offset. Target base stock $\approx$ (3 periods * 725 units) + 579 units $\approx$ 2754 units. Setting mu_hat to 2754 ensures the backend places a replenishment order that accounts for the current demand regime despite the pipeline data error. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P38-P40) range from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to escalate significantly, with Period 44 reaching a new peak of 873 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is approximately 762.2 units, a substantial increase from the previous high-demand regime. Lead times remain variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 assumption for safety. A critical constraint remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 579 units (from lost orders P15, P17, P18) which the OR backend still accounts for, reducing its calculated order size. To bypass this and ensure adequate replenishment during this growth phase, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on (L+1) * current average demand, then add the 579 unit offset to counteract the phantom inventory. Target mu_hat = (3+1) * 762 + 579 \u2248 3627. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to reflect the higher standard deviation observed during this volatile demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 44: 5-period average (P40-P44) jumped to ~762 units, with a peak of 873. Total phantom pipeline inventory from confirmed lost orders P15, P17, and P18 remains 579 units, requiring a sustained explicit mu_hat offset of at least this amount to maintain replenishment.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has escalated dramatically, with the last five periods (P41-P45) averaging 804.8 units, peaking at 907 in Period 45. There is a confirmed structural issue with the 'In-transit' inventory: orders from Period 15 (221), Period 17 (227), and Period 18 (131) \u2013 totaling 579 units \u2013 are more than 27 periods overdue and effectively lost. Furthermore, the current in-transit figure of 3600 units is significantly bloated relative to actual replenishment needs. If the OR engine subtracts this full pipeline from its base stock calculation, it will stop ordering entirely. To solve this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the value: I use a forecasted demand of 900 units/period across (L+1) periods. With L=3 (to protect against bimodal 1-3 period lead times), (L+1)*900 = 3600. I then add an offset of 579 units to 'neutralize' the lost orders in the pipeline, totaling 4179. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (explicit) to account for the high volatility and frequent stockouts observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly at Period 45: 5-period average (P41-P45) is 804.8 units, a ~33% increase over the P36-P40 average (~605). Total phantom pipeline inventory from confirmed lost orders (P15, P17, P18) remains 579 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely high growth phase, with the most recent demand hitting 907 and 968. The last 5 periods (P42-P46) average ~851.6 units. Lead time continues to be erratic, ranging between 1 and 3 periods. A critical structural issue persists: orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) were lost and never arrived. Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, these 579 phantom units would cause the system to under-order indefinitely. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My desired base stock (to cover lead time 3 + 1 period of demand at the 850+ unit regime) is approximately (3 + 1) * 850 = 3400. Adding the 579-unit phantom offset to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 3979. This ensures the backend emits an order size that accounts for both the demand surge and the missing pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly at P44: latest 5-period average is 851.6 units (P42-P46), a ~40% increase over the P36-P40 average. Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (579 units) remains a permanent offset.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward trajectory, with the latest 5-period average (P43-P47) reaching 899.2 units, peaking at 968. This represents a substantial increase compared to the previous regime. The supply chain remains highly volatile, with another period of zero arrivals (P47) despite a massive in-transit volume of 4390 units. However, consistent with previous long-term observations, orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) are definitively lost and must be treated as phantom inventory. To ensure the OR engine actually places orders despite this 579-unit 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 579-unit offset. With L=2 (promised) but effectively 3 for safety, and an average demand of ~900, the target order-up-to level should be ((3+1) * 900) + 579 = 4179. I also set sigma_hat explicitly to 250 to account for the high volatility and potential for further demand spikes. This approach bypasses the capped policy's reliance on 'total' pipeline inventory which includes the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly at Period 44: 5-period average (P43-P47) is 899.2 units (+48% vs P36-P40 average). Total phantom pipeline inventory from confirmed lost orders (P15, P17, P18) remains 579 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has escalated dramatically since Period 44, with the most recent demand hitting 1043 units. The last 5 periods (P44-P48) average approximately 950 units/period. The supply chain is currently in a severe bottleneck, with zero arrivals in the last four periods (P45-P48) despite an in-transit volume of 4,390 units. History confirms that orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units) are permanently lost; this 'phantom' inventory must be offset in our calculations to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final ordering opportunity. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and 50) using the most recent high-demand regime (~950/period) plus the 579-unit phantom offset to ensure the OR logic places a significant order to capture any remaining demand, even though arrival in Period 50 is physically the last chance to sell.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated again: Period 44-48 average is 949.6 units, peaking at 1043 in P48. Supply chain bottleneck: No arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P45-P48). Phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders P15, P17, and P18 remains at 579 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase. There has been a massive supply chain bottleneck with no arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P45-P49), while demand has escalated rapidly to over 1,000 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is highly inflated (4,390 units), part of which is the 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost orders P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 579 units). Additionally, the recent lack of arrivals (P45-P48) suggests either a temporary blockage or further lost shipments. To navigate the OR backend's inventory deduction and its ordering cap, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~1,070 units per period. Over a lead time of 2 (3 periods total), this equals 3,210. I then add the 579 'phantom' units to prevent the engine from under-ordering due to non-existent supply, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 3,789. Lead time L is set to explicit 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals observed in history and the current logistical delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Supply chain failure continues with no arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P45-P49). Demand peaked at 1097 in P49. The 579-unit phantom pipeline (P15, P17, P18) still requires an explicit offset in mu_hat calculations to bypass the backend ordering cap.
