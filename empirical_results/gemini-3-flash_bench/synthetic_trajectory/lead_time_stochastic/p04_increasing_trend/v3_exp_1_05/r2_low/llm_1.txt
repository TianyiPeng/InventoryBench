To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods) because the order placed now will arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be available for sale in Period 3.

Projected demand for the next three periods based on the trend: P1(~103), P2(~115), P3(~130). Total expected demand for P1-P3 is approximately 348 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I must be careful not to overstock, but since initial inventory is zero, a significant order is required to avoid lost sales in the coming periods.",

Lead time analysis: Period 1 order (350 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), but Period 3 order (50 units) also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1).
