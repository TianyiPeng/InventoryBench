Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods (which are provided in the system prompt) are 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a visible upward trend in these samples (mean ~115.6, but the last two are 127 and 160). Since we are at Period 1 decision-making and have these 5 pre-existing samples, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this initial variance and mean. This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock using (1+L) * mean and sqrt(1+L) * std based on the available history. The high relative holding cost (equal to profit) suggests the service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning we target the median demand over the protection interval.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 165 units were ordered and 118 units were demanded. Since on-hand was 0 and the promised lead time is 2, no units were sold. The 118 lost sales represent the immediate demand level. Previous samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show a mean of ~115. Period 1 demand of 118 is consistent with this average. I will use the promised lead time L=2 for now. Since the stockout in Period 1 was complete, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 345 units). I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent samples including the Period 1 observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) was [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], while the demand during Period 1 and 2 was 118 and 88, respectively. The average demand across these 7 observations is ~112. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (165 units) and P2 (167 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the P1 order should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Thus, the current on-hand inventory of 0 is expected. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent levels while smoothing noise, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to maintain stability until actual lead time is confirmed.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (165 units), Period 2 (167 units), and Period 3 (28 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed/lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed all demand so far (Periods 1-3). Demand samples show a mean of ~115 (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). Period 5 demand was 160, suggesting an upward trend. Given the arrival failure, I will explicitly increase the Lead Time parameter to 3 to force the OR engine to account for a longer pipeline requirement. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean to capture the recent increase, and use explicit for sigma to ensure we carry enough safety stock to handle the high volatility and current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude. Demand showing upward trend from ~100 to 160 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-43.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the 'Period 4 conclude' message, two orders arrived totaling 193 units (165 from P1 and 28 from P3). The P1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived in just 1 period. This indicates high volatility in actual lead times compared to the promised 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 118, and in-transit is 288 (orders from P2 and P4). Demand history (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) shows a steady upward trend, with the last period peaking at 160. Given the lead time instability and rising demand, I am setting L to 2 (the promised value, as it sits between the observed 3 and 1) but using recent_N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the upward trend and increased volatility quickly. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the most recent higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. Demand trend confirmed increasing: 5-period avg 115.6, but last 2 periods avg 143.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time history. The demand data provided in the prompt (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggests a clear upward trend, whereas the 'conclude' messages show lower demand (118, 88, 108, 75, 95). I will reconcile this by prioritizing the trend observed in the historical demand data samples (avg 115.6, but 160 in P5). Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2, but we've seen 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. However, the inconsistency poses a risk. Pipeline inventory is currently 288 (orders from P2, P4, and potentially P5 if it wasn't zero). Specifically, P2 order (167 units) is currently at LT=4 and hasn't arrived, suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. To ensure availability given the demand spike to 160 and the unreliable lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed maximum delay. I'll use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent high demand (avg 131 across P3-P5) and default for sigma to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time volatility: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1, whereas P2 order is overdue at 4+ periods (possible loss). Demand trend shows significant variance between sample data (upward to 160) and conclude data (avg ~97).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand. Looking at historical arrivals: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, but P2 (ordered 167 units) is now 5 periods overdue (ordered P2, currently P7 start), suggesting it is likely lost. Demand in the 'conclude' messages (P1-P6) has an average of 101 units, contrasting with the provided pre-game samples which showed an upward trend to 160. Given the high stockout risk (ending inventory 0) and the missing P2 shipment, I need to ensure the pipeline is replenished. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed maximum successful lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of the observed demand in the game history (approx 101/period) over the last 6 periods to stabilize against the pre-game trend which has not materialized in the actual sales data. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect the observed volatility in demand (ranging 75-122).

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (167 units) presumed lost after 5 periods (promised 2). Demand has stabilized around ~100 units/period (avg 101 over P1-P6) despite higher pre-game samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a heavy demand in Period 7 (167 units). Historical demand analysis (P1-P7) shows an average of ~110.5 units, though volatility is high. Lead times are extremely unstable: P1 arrived in 3, P2 (167 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, P3 arrived in 1, and P4 arrived in 3. This indicates an average effective lead time closer to 3. Given the stockout and the loss of the P2 shipment, we must ensure the pipeline (283 units) covers the next 3-4 periods of demand. Setting L to 3 reflects the actual observed delay. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) captures the recent fluctuation (avg ~113 over the last 5 periods) while sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to aggressive restock to mitigate the lost shipment and stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Permanent loss of Period 2 order (167 units) confirmed after 6 periods. Average lead time for successful deliveries is 2.33, but actual arrivals range from 1 to 3 periods, requiring a conservative L=3 for planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 with 0 on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 398 units. Historical performance shows Significant lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods) and the loss of the Period 2 order. Average lead time for successful deliveries is (3+1+3+1)/4 = 2 periods, but with P2 missing and two orders taking 3 periods, setting L=3 (explicit) is necessary to ensure the (L+1) coverage window accounts for delays. Demand analysis shows a significant shift: while the first 6 periods averaged ~101, the last two periods (P7-P8) saw demand spike to 167 and 214 respectively (avg 190.5). Including pre-game samples (avg 115) alongside game history (avg 123), the recent surge suggests a new high-demand regime, likely seasonal. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this upward movement (160 from P5 samples, 167 from P7, 214 from P8) and sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this spike. The backend will target a 50% service level (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1)), which is appropriate given high holding costs relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: avg demand increased from ~100 to 190.5 (+90%) over the last two periods. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods for successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 471 units in transit. The demand has undergone a significant regime shift: over the last three periods (P7-P9), demand average has surged to 193.3 (167, 214, 199) from the previous baseline of ~100. Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries, and Period 2 order (167 units) is confirmed lost. Because we are currently stocked out and demand is high, I will set L=3 (explicit) to ensure the system accounts for the potential 3-period delay observed in history. I'm using N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this high-demand regime (+90% increase) and N=3 for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the increased standard deviation during this period of high demand and supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~193. Lead time volatility continues, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods for successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand and 704 units in-transit. History shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 7: the average demand from Period 7 to Period 10 is 176.25 units, compared to the initial ~100. However, Period 10 saw a dip to 125 units, suggesting volatility in this new high-demand regime. Lead times have been highly inconsistent, with successful deliveries taking 1, 1, and 3 periods recently, while the Period 2 order (167 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 9 order (244 units) and Period 10 order (233 units) are currently undelivered. Given the variability, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed successful lead time. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the shift to higher demand (average ~176), and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime (standard deviation of ~41.5). This approach helps minimize stockouts while adjusting for the unreliability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 7-10 average 176.25 units, a 75% increase over the baseline Period 1-6 average of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with 705 units in transit. The Period 10 order (233 units) and Period 9 order (244 units) are still outstanding. Based on historical data, the actual lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1, P8=1), with one confirmed lost order (P2). To build a safety buffer for this volatility and prevent stockouts, I am setting L=3 (the observed maximum for successful deliveries). Demand has shifted significantly; the average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P7-P11) is 178.8 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and increased variance (standard deviation in this regime is approx 35). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher demand mean and the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 7-11 average demand is 178.8 units (+78% from baseline). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), requiring L=3 for conservative planning.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, 477 units arrived (Period 9 and 10 orders), leaving an on-hand inventory of 264. Demand has clearly shifted upward since Period 7. Analysis of Periods 7-12 shows a mean demand of 184.5 units (167, 214, 199, 125, 189, 213). Although Period 6 had a low demand of 122, the subsequent periods average significantly higher (~185). Lead times remain inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods: P9 took 3, P10 took 2, P8 took 1, P7 took 1, and P4 took 3. To protect against stockouts during this high-demand regime given the potential for 3-period lead times, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the backend covers (3+1)=4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I am using N=6 to capture the recent high-demand regime since Period 7. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=6 to reflect the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 7-12 average demand is 184.5 units (+85% from early game baseline).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 13 is approximately 188.8 units (167, 214, 199, 125, 189, 213, 215). This represents a significant shift from the initial pre-game samples and early period average (~100-115). Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P2: Lost, P3: 1, P4: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1, P9: 3, P10: 2). To account for this volatility and ensure availability, I am setting L=3 (the conservative upper bound of observed successful deliveries). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 7-13). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect the increased variance observed in this period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 49 and in-transit is 474 (the large orders from P11/P12/P13). Setting these parameters allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering 4 periods of demand at the current high average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 7-13 average demand is 188.8 units (+80% from original baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 202 units in Period 14, where only 50 units were sold. The demand regime shift that began around Period 7 has stabilized; the average demand from Period 7 to Period 14 is approximately 189 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P11-P14) have averaged 204 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, with recent arrivals showing L=3 (P11 order), L=2 (P10 order), and L=3 (P9 order). Given this volatility and the critical stockout situation, I am maintaining an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the pipeline correctly. mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized higher demand regime (approx 189 units per period), and sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=8 to reflect the current volatility in that regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 7-14 has stabilized at an average of 189 units per period, with a further lift toward ~200 units in the most recent 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 7, increasing from ~101 to ~185 units. In the most recent four periods (P12-P15), demand averaged 197 units. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to consecutive stockouts while waiting for lead-time-constrained arrivals. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. To protect service levels given the current 0 on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts, I am setting L=3 to account for the longest observed successful lead time. The \u03bc\u0302 will be set using recent_N=9 (covering the transition starting at Period 7) to capture the higher demand regime, while \u03c3\u0302 will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the increased volatility since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P7-P15 has fully stabilized at ~185 units with high volatility in the last 4 periods (avg ~197).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly stabilized since Period 7, with a high-mean environment. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 16 is approximately 188.7 units. The most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) show an average of 196.6 units, indicating a sustained higher level of demand compared to the initial pre-game baseline. Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2, P11:3, P12:3, P13:3). To ensure adequate service levels and buffer against both demand spikes and three-period arrivals, I am setting L=3 explicitly for planning. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime that began at Period 7. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=10 to capture the relevant volatility of this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 7. Over the last 11 periods (P7-P17), the average demand is 188.4 units. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17), the average is 193.0 units, indicating a slight upward drift or sustained high demand plateau. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P13, P14, and P15 orders all took 3 periods to conclude). No orders have been lost recently, but the P15 order (56 units) and P16 order (0 units - a non-order) are the only pending shipments before the large P17 order of 195 units. Given the lead time volatility and a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0 (implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, though the backend's capped policy provides a buffer), I will use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while maintaining a conservative L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P7-P17 stabilized at avg 188 units (+88% from early baseline). Lead time consistently hits 3 periods for recent major orders (P13, P14, P15 orders all took 3 periods).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at an inventory of 0 with 676 units in transit. Demand analysis confirms a stable high-demand regime since Period 7, with the most recent data (Period 18) showing a peak of 250 units. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 18 is approximately 190 units. Lead time analysis shows continued volatility, but the last four significant orders (from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14) have consistently arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual operational lead time is 3. Following this pattern, the order from Period 15 (56 units) should have arrived in Period 18 but did not, potentially signaling a short delay or a small loss, though larger orders from P17 and P18 are still within the expected 3-period window. To maintain service levels given the 0 on-hand inventory and the recent demand spike, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to cover the review and lead time (4 periods of demand). mu_hat is set to 760 (190 avg * 4 periods) using recent_N (N=12) to capture the current regime, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=12) to account for the high volatility seen in this period range (125 to 250 units).

Carry-over insight: Lead time for major orders since P11 has consistently been 3 periods (observed for P11, P12, P13, P14). Demand regime P7-P18 remains stable at avg ~190 units (+90% from initial baseline).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 7 and has stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 13 periods (P7-P19), the mean demand is approximately 190.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P18: 250, P19: 215) confirms this elevated level. Lead time continues to be volatile and frequently extends to 3 periods for substantial orders (recently observed for P11, P12, P13, P14). To avoid stockouts in this high-variability environment, especially with 0 on-hand inventory and a large pipeline (774 units), I am setting L=3 to cover the (L+1) period demand window. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 7 while ignoring the lower initial baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 7 at average ~190 units/period. Lead time for major shipments consistently observed at 3 periods (exceeding promised 2).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 7, with the average demand from Period 7 to Period 20 being approximately 199.5 units. Recent periods (P18-P20) show an even higher surge, with demand peaking at 324 units in Period 20. On the supply side, lead times have consistently demonstrated a 3-period delay for major orders, despite the promised 2-period lead time. Significant order clusters (P18-P20) are currently in-transit (781 units total) but have not arrived yet. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, the goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers the observed 3-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=4). I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent actual lead time. For mu_hat, N=14 (from P7 onwards) would give ~200, but given the recent spike to 324, a more responsive EWMA_gamma of 0.3 or a narrow recent_N is preferred to account for the potential upward trend while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent average (~240 units) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked at 324 units in Period 20, suggesting a potential further upward shift within the established high-demand regime; average demand since P18 is ~263 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 944 units in-transit. Demand has significantly accelerated since Period 18, with the last four periods averaging ~268 units (250, 215, 324, 283). This represents a clear second regime shift upward from the ~190 average established in Period 7. Regarding lead time, we are observing a significant cluster of delayed shipments: orders from Period 17 (195 units), Period 18 (198 units), and Period 19 (98 units) have not arrived yet. Since the Period 17 order is now at L=4 (beyond the frequent L=3 seen recently) and on-hand is zero, I am setting L to 4 to reflect this logistics stretch. For mu_hat, I am using N=15 to capture the broad high-demand regime since Period 7 while the OR engine's service level logic handles the recent peak. This configuration aims to trigger an aggressive restock to clear the current backlog and meet the elevated demand level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 18: average demand increased from ~190 to ~268 (+41%) over the last 4 periods. Lead time stretching beyond 3 periods; Period 17 order (placed P17) has not arrived by P21 conclude (L=4+).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a significant supply crisis. The Period 17 order (195 units) is now at lead time 5+ with no arrival confirmed by the end of Period 22, indicating severe logistics delays or potential lost shipments similar to Period 2. On-hand inventory is 0, and lead times for the last several successful shipments were 3 periods, though current evidence suggests it has stretched further. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 18, averaging approximately 279 units over the last 5 periods (250, 215, 324, 283, 322). To recover service levels and account for the pipeline risk, I am setting L=5 (explicit) to reflect the recent lack of arrivals and force a larger pipeline target. Mu_hat is set to 279 * (1+5) = 1674, and Sigma_hat is calculated explicitly using recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this period of high demand and delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime since Period 18: average ~279 units/period (+47% from P7-P17 average). Lead time has deteriorated significantly; Period 17-21 orders (1048 units total in-transit) have not arrived, with P17 now at L=5+.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently experiencing a severe supply chain disruption. While common logic suggests ordering to keep up with the new high-demand regime (average ~290 over the last 6 periods), the lead-time behavior is extremely erratic. Historically, orders have taken 1-3 periods, but orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 491 units) are now 4-6 periods overdue and have not arrived as of the Period 23 conclude message. Interestingly, more recent small orders (P20, P21, P22) arrived in Period 23, creating a 'last-in, first-out' or batch-processing arrival pattern. This suggests the older shipments are likely lost or significantly delayed. Despite 1127 units technically 'in-transit', the core pipeline (the older, larger orders) is failing. I am setting L=6 to reflect the current delay of the oldest missing shipment (P17), and mu_hat is set using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the recent demand surge (~287 units/period). This aggressive mu_hat, combined with an extended L, will signal the OR backend to place larger orders to compensate for the high probability of lost in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain breakdown confirmed at P23: Orders from P17-P19 (491 units) are overdue by 4+ periods, while subsequent orders (P20-P22) arrived in a single batch in P23. Demand regime has shifted again at P18 to ~287 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing extreme stockouts and supply chain volatility. Period 24 concluded with zero on-hand inventory and a demand of 286 units (all lost). Since Period 18, a new demand regime has stabilized with an average of ~287 units per period. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 491 units) are now overdue by 5+ periods and are likely lost or severely delayed. In contrast, orders from P20-P22 arrived as a batch in P23. Given this unreliability, I must use a conservative lead time (L=4) to account for the frequent delays beyond the promised 2 periods and the recent complete stockout. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (~287 units/period) while acknowledging the significant lost sales. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the high volatility in both demand and delivery timing. The pipeline inventory (1492 units) is large, but much of it (491 units) is potentially lost, and current on-hand is zero, necessitating aggressive replenishment parameters to signal the OR backend to prioritize restoring stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Orders from P17-P19 (491 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. Demand regime since P18 is stable at ~287 units/period (+51% from P7-P17 baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the demand regime from Period 18 onwards remains stable, with an average of approximately 289 units over the last 8 periods (P18-P25). The most recent period (P25) recorded a demand of 325 units. The supply chain continues to show evidence of lost orders (P17-P19 are now 6-8 periods overdue and are likely permanent losses) and batching of arrivals. Current pipeline inventory (1139 units) is heavily inflated by these likely lost shipments. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am setting L=2 (promised) relative to current inventory logic while using an 'explicit' mu_hat to cover the high demand regime. Since Q = 0.5 (profit $1 = holding cost $1), the base stock hits the mean. Given the supply instability, mu_hat is set to (1+L=3) * 310 units = 930 to ensure sufficient stock for the current period and lead time, and sigma_hat is set high (130) to account for demand variance and arrival uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain loss confirmed for P17-P19 orders (491 units total) as they have exceeded 6+ periods of lead time (promised 2). Demand regime since P18 is stable at avg 289 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 18, with the average demand increasing to approximately 289 units per period (last 9 periods average is 292). Period 26 demand remains high at 351. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 491 units) are now confirmed lost as they have exceeded a 7-period lead time (promised 2). The Period 24 order of 365 units is expected to arrive during either Period 27 (L=3) or Period 28 (L=4) given recent volatility. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current in-transit pipeline of 1139 units (excluding lost orders, active pipeline is approximately 648 units from P24 onwards), I am maintaining a conservative lead time estimate of L=3 to account for historical delays. mu_hat is set to reflect the current high-demand regime since P18 (N=9 samples), and sigma_hat is adjusted for the associated high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P18 remains stable and high, averaging 292 units per period (Periods 18-26). Supply chain loss for P17-P19 orders (491 units) is now definitive at 7+ periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high regime since Period 18, averaging 318 units over the last 5 periods (P23-P27: 329, 286, 325, 351, 379). This indicates a significant upward movement from the previous P18-P23 average. Lead time remains erratic but shows a return to functionality for newer orders (P20-P23 arrived). However, orders from P17-P19 (491 units total) are now 8+ periods overdue and must be treated as permanently lost. To adapt to the new higher demand baseline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the shift from approx 190 to ~300+ units. I will use a conservative L=3 to account for the frequent delays beyond the promised 2 periods, ensuring the base stock covers the current high-demand volatility and the zero on-hand inventory state.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Average demand increased from ~290 to ~334 units (+15%) over the last 5 periods. Total definitive loss of orders from P17-P19 confirmed (491 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a very high level. Since Period 23, the last 6 periods show a mean demand of 344 units per period (329, 286, 325, 351, 379, 394), significantly higher than the previous Period 18-22 average of ~270. Consequently, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this peak regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility (std dev ~38 in this window). Regarding lead time, the supply chain remains highly unstable. Historical lead times fluctuate wildly between 1 and 3 periods, with significant losses (P17-P19). Currently, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1226 units includes the P24 order (365 units, now at L=4 and overdue), the P27 order (55), and the P28 order (32). Given that the P24 order has not arrived, I am setting L=4 via the 'explicit' method to account for the current delay and ensure the OR engine maintains a larger pipeline to cover the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Average demand increased from ~290 to ~344 units (+18%) over the last 6 periods. Lead time remains unstable; Period 24 order (365 units) is now overdue (L=4+).

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 23, with the most recent 7 periods (P23-P29) averaging 352.3 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~290. Current period on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains unstable: while the Period 27 order arrived in 2 periods, the Period 24 (365 units), Period 25 (0 units), and Period 26 (0 units) window shows a massive gap in supply, making those earlier orders from P24 and P17-P19 highly likely lost. The pipeline now consists of P24 (365 - likely lost), P28 (32), and P29 (409). I will set L=4 to provide a buffer against the observed supply chain volatility and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers the new high-demand regime) to reflect the current 350+ units/period trend. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to capture the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Average demand increased to ~352 units (+21% from Period 18-22 average). Period 24 order (365 units) is now 5 periods overdue and presumed lost, similar to the P17-P19 losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant escalation. Starting from Period 23, the average demand has risen to approximately 352 units, with the most recent Period 30 reaching a peak of 457. This suggests a sustained high-demand regime or a sharp upward trend. Regarding the supply chain, we are facing significant periodic losses: the batch from P17-P19 (491 units) is definitively lost, and the P24 order (365 units) is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2), following the same pattern. As of Period 31, inventory is critical: 0 on-hand and 1730 in-transit (of which 365 from P24 and 491 from P17-P19 are likely gone). To adjust for this, I am setting L=3 to account for the observed volatility. I'll use mu_hat with recent_N=8 (covering the high-demand regime from P23) to capture the current mean of ~358 units/period. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is extremely high, but because much of it is likely lost, the OR Capped Policy's cap will naturally trigger to ensure we keep ordering enough to meet this new demand level without over-relying on 'phantom' arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg increased to ~358 units (+24% from the Period 18-22 avg). Order from Period 24 (365 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, matching the P17-P19 loss pattern.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again starting around Period 23, with the last 9 periods (P23-P31) averaging approximately 370 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~290. The most recent 4 periods (P28-P31) show even higher demand at an average of 413 units. Supply chain reliability remains a major issue; the order from Period 24 (365 units) is now 7 periods overdue (L=7) and is definitively lost, following the pattern of the P17-P19 losses. Lead times for successful arrivals (P27 and P28 orders) have stabilized at 2 periods, but the systemic risk of lost orders necessitates high coverage. Mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 410 = 1640 to handle the current demand peak, and L is set to an explicit 3 to account for periodic delays and the high cost of stockouts when orders are lost.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Average demand increased from ~290 to ~370 (+27%). Order from Period 24 (365 units) is now 7 periods overdue and definitively lost, confirming a repeating pattern of catastrophic supply chain failure every 6-8 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 23, with the last 10 periods (P23-P32) averaging ~386 units, and the most recent 3 periods spike to over 430 units. This suggests a likely second seasonal or trend-based lift. Therefore, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 10 to capture this high-demand stage. Lead time remains erratic and prone to catastrophic failure; orders from P17-P19 and P24 have been confirmed lost (exceeding 6+ periods). For existing inventory planning, L is set to 3 to reflect the upper end of 'successful' delivery times observed (P13-P17 all took 3 periods). The high sigma_hat (recent_N=10) accounts for the extreme demand volatility seen in the last few periods (ranging from 286 to 507). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large pipeline (1730 units) that includes vulnerable orders, the OR backend needs these parameters to trigger replenishment that accounts for the current 400+ unit demand reality while being wary of the high holding cost if the pipeline suddenly clears.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime since Period 23: average ~386 units/period, with a significant spike to 430+ units in the last 3 periods. Supply chain failure pattern confirmed: orders from Period 24 (365 units) are now definitively lost after 8 periods, following the same loss pattern as P17-P19.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts. The most recent regime, starting around Period 30, shows demand peaking above 500 units (Last 3 periods average: 475.6). On the supply side, a pattern of systemic failure has emerged: orders from Period 24 are definitively lost (8 periods overdue), mirroring previous losses of orders from Periods 17-19. Currently, 1730 units are in-transit, but the reliability of these arrivals is questionable given the historical losses. Stockout conditions have persisted since Period 31. To account for the intensified demand and the risk of lead-time extensions or losses, I am setting L=3 (explicitly chosen as the reliable upper bound for successful deliveries) and mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand spike using the average of the last 4 periods (approx 457 units). This aggressive base-stock target aims to bridge the stockout gap once the current in-transit orders (likely from Period 29 or 30) finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 30: average demand increased to ~457 units/period (+24% from P23-P29 average). Recyclical supply chain failure confirmed: Period 24 order (365 units) definitively lost after 8 periods, confirming Periodic total loss of batches.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced three distinct upward shifts: first in P7 (to ~190), then in P18 (to ~290), and most recently since P30, where demand has surged to an average of 475 units/period (P30-P34: 457, 402, 507, 518, 492). For Period 35, I am focusing on this latest regime (N=5). Stock levels are currently critical (0 on-hand), and the supply chain is notoriously unreliable. Historical patterns (P17-P19 and P24) show that orders exceeding a 6-period lead time are effectively lost. Although there are 1884 units 'in-transit', the P17-P19 orders (491 units), the P24 order (365 units), and potentially P25-P26 orders are likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, and that pipeline is inflated with 850+ units of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. This compensates for the backend's overestimation of available supply. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays beyond the promised 2 periods, and mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1) of the new high-demand regime (~475 * 4 = 1900), adjusted upward to force the engine to place an order despite the 'in-transit' phantom units.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 30: average demand increased to ~475 units/period (+28% from P23-P29 average). Recurrent supply chain losses of batches older than 6 periods are confirmed (P17-P19 and P24).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent shift occurring around Period 30, bringing average demand to approximately 475 units per period. The supply chain exhibits a catastrophic failure pattern where specific batches (P17-P19 and P24) are completely lost after exceeding a lead time of 6-8 periods. Currently, 2400 units are in-transit, including large orders from P29 (409 units) and P30 (182 units) which are now at lead times of 7 and 6 respectively; based on history, these are at high risk of being lost. Given the 'in-transit' total includes these potentially lost units, I must set parameters to ensure the OR engine triggers new orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current ~475 unit regime (P30-P35 avg). I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the volatile but frequently observed 3-period actual lead time for successful deliveries, ensuring the base stock covers (3+1) periods of this high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at Period 30: average demand increased to ~493 units/period over the last 6 periods (P30-P35). Recurrent supply chain losses confirmed for orders exceeding 6 periods (P17-P19, P24), suggesting P29 and P30 orders are likely lost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime starting from Period 30, averaging approximately 510 units over the last 7 periods (P30-P36). Lead time is highly unreliable; while P34 arrived in 2 periods, the supply chain frequently exhibits catastrophic failures where batches are lost if they don't arrive within 4 periods (as seen with P17-P19 and P24). The orders from P29 (409 units) and P30 (182 units) are now 7 and 6 periods overdue respectively and are highly likely lost based on historical patterns. With 0 on-hand inventory and the loss of P29-P30 orders, the OR backend needs to account for the current demand mean of ~510. I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent high-demand regime. Lead time L is set to 3 to provide a buffer against the observed volatility, even though the promised lead time is 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 30 at average ~510 units/period (+42% from P23-P29 average). Recurring supply chain failure confirmed: orders from Period 29 (409 units) and Period 30 (182 units) are definitively lost after exceeding 6 periods of lead time, mirroring the loss of P24 and P17-P19.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 30 at an average of approximately 510-520 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P33-P37) show an average of 545 units, reflecting a high-volume, high-volatility peak. Supply chain behavior is characterized by periodic catastrophic failures where entire batches (e.g., P17-P19, P24, P29-P30) are lost after exceeding 6 periods of lead time. To mitigate the risk of stockouts while avoiding over-ordering into a potentially failing channel, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 to account for historical volatility in successful arrivals. Demand parameters (mu_hat) are set using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime from P30 onwards while smoothing out the most recent spikes. sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the observed standard deviation in the recent high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer against the high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 30 at avg ~520 units/period. Recurrent supply chain failure confirmed: orders from Period 29 (409 units) and Period 30 (182 units) are definitively lost after 7+ periods, following the failure pattern of P24 and P17-P19.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 38 is approximately 544 units per period (N=9). Recent activity shows a further upward push, with Period 38 hitting 614 units. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this high-demand regime. Regarding lead time, the supply chain exhibits a catastrophic pattern where orders exceeding a 6-period lead time are consistently lost (confirmed losses for P17-19, P24, P29, and P30). However, successful deliveries typically arrive within 2-3 periods. I will set L to 3 periods to maintain a conservative pipeline relative to the 2-period promised lead time. The in-transit inventory is currently 2,046 units, though the system must account for the fact that significantly delayed units are likely never arriving. Setting sigma_hat with recent_N (N=9) will account for the high volatility ($s \approx 65$ per period) observed in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we observed a demand of 648 units, continuing an aggressive upward trend that began around Period 30. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 595 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) average 612 units. Given the high stockout levels and the $1/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost, a conservative over-estimation of demand is necessary to capture potential sales in the final 10 periods. Lead times have become shorter recently (P38 arrived in 1 period, P34-P35 arrived in 2 periods), but history shows a pattern of catastrophic batch losses (P17-P19, P24, P29-P30). I am setting L=3 to account for potential delivery volatility despite the recent L=1 arrival. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 615 to reflect the most recent demand peak and trend. sigma_hat is maintained at a high N=10 to account for the extreme volatility observed across the different demand regimes and to boost the base stock level given the 50% critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 34: average demand increased to ~595 units/period (+14% from P30-P34 average). Supply chain volatility remains high, but recent orders (P34, P35, P38) have arrived within 1-2 periods, breaking the previous pattern of 6-8 period delays/losses.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-growth regime starting around Period 34, with the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging approximately 609 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P39-P40) are nearly 650 units, indicating a consistent upward trend. Supply chain performance has stabilized significantly compared to the catastrophic failures seen earlier (P17-P33); recent orders from P34, P35, and P38 arrived within 1-2 periods. However, given the massive 'In-transit' quantity (2460 units), which includes potential historical losses and large recent orders, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 7-period demand average (P34-P40) to capture the current high-demand state (~591 per period). I will use a conservative lead time L=3 to mitigate the risk of a return to the previously observed 3rd-period delivery pattern. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher demand volumes.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 34: average demand increased to ~591 units/period (+14% from P30-P34 average). Supply chain reliability has improved, but lead-time volatility requires L=3 for safety.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-growth phase starting around Period 34, with the most recent demand hitting 755 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is approximately 666 units. While the supply chain saw catastrophic failures and batch losses earlier (P17-P19, P24, P29-P30), recent performance has stabilized with lead times of 1-2 periods (as seen in P36, P37, and P39 concludes). However, the in-transit inventory is currently very high (2460 units), primarily due to a large order of 730 units in Period 40 that has not yet arrived but is within the expected lead time window. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is surging, I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime since P34, and a conservative L=3 to account for potential recurrence of lead time volatility seen historically.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 34: average demand increased from ~520 to ~640 units/period (+23%) over the last 8 observation periods. Supply reliability has improved but remains volatile; maintaining L=3 for safety is prudent given history of 3-period arrivals and periodic losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again, starting around Period 40. The average demand over the last three periods (P40-P42) is approximately 715 units/period, compared to the previously established average of ~640 units identified in Period 42. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while in-transit inventory is high (2460 units), there have been no arrivals in the last three periods (P40, P41, P42). Specifically, the large order of 730 units from Period 40 is now 2 periods old. Historically, the supply chain for this SKU demonstrates recurrent catastrophic failures where batches older than 6 periods are lost. However, recent arrivals (P34-P38) showed improved lead times of 1-2 periods. To account for the current demand spike (~715 units/period) and maintain a conservative buffer against lead-time volatility that has frequently reached 3 periods for successful deliveries, I am setting L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent spike to >700 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed in this higher-demand state.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 40: average demand increased from ~640 to ~715 units/period (+12%) over the last 3 periods. Lead time remains volatile; the P40 order (730 units) has not arrived after 2 periods, requiring a return to conservative L=3 planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $730.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted decisively upward starting around Period 40, with the last four periods averaging approximately 730 units (755, 741, 774, plus recent historical context). The Period 40 order of 730 units arrived in Period 43 (L=3), confirming that lead times remain volatile and can extend to 3 periods despite a promised 2. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 400 units in-transit (from Period 43). To cover the demand over the review plus lead-time period (L+1 = 4 periods), I am setting mu_hat to 2920 (4 * 730) and sigma_hat to 150 to account for the high demand volatility and shipment risk. L is set to 3 to reflect the most recent confirmed lead time for a large delivery (Period 40 order), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the observed supply delay.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 40: average demand has stabilized around 730 units/period (avg of P41-P43 is 757, but choosing 730 for stability). Lead time for the most recent large order (P40) was confirmed at 3 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts, most recently stabilizing at a very high level. The average demand from Period 41 to 44 is approximately 779 units per period. Lead time remains volatile but has recently settled at 3 periods (observed for the Period 40 order, which arrived in Period 43). Given that On-hand is currently 0 and pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 2920 units\u2014spanning orders from Periods 17-21 (presumed lost), Period 24 (presumed lost), Period 29-30 (presumed lost), and the large active orders from Periods 43-44\u2014I must account for both the higher demand regime and the periodic total loss of older shipment batches. I will set L=3 explicitly to provide a conservative buffer for the (L+1) demand window and use an explicit mu_hat of 3116 (779 units/period * 4 periods) to reflect the current high-demand reality. The stockout in Period 44 despite the Period 40 arrival reinforces the need for aggressive base-stock parameters to capture the ~800 unit/period demand spike.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 41: Average demand has surged to ~780 units/period (P41-P44 avg: 778.75). Lead time for significant orders is confirmed at 3 periods. Historical pattern of catastrophic delivery failure (loss of all units in a batch) remains a risk every 6-8 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 46, on-hand inventory is 0, and 2,716 units are in-transit. Demand has significantly accelerated starting around Period 40, with the most recent sample (P45) hitting 919 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 806.8 units. The supply chain remains volatile: while the P43 order arrived in 2 periods, the P40 order took 3 periods, and history shows a pattern of catastrophic batch losses (P17-P19, P24, P29-P30). To mitigate stockout risk during the final periods (46-50), I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrival timeline. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture the current upward trajectory (averaging ~807 units/period), resulting in a base stock targeted at (1+3)*807 = 3,228 units. This strategy aims to ensure that the massive in-transit pipeline (2,716 units) and a new order cover the remaining demand peak while accounting for lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 41: Average demand increased to ~807 units/period (+55% from the Period 30-40 baseline of ~520). Lead time volatility persists with a recurring 3-period fulfillment window observed for major orders (P40), maintaining L=3 as the necessary planning horizon.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-growth regime starting from Period 41, with the most recent three periods (P44-P46) showing demand levels of 845, 919, and 930 respectively. The average demand over the last six periods (P41-P46) is approximately 860 units per period. The supply chain remains volatile; while the P43 order arrived in 2 periods, the P40 order took 3, and the P44 order (790 units) has not arrived yet after 2 periods. Given the high demand and the risk of stockouts at the end of the game (Period 50), I am setting L=3 to account for the observed 3-period lead time for major deliveries. I will use the most recent 6 periods (P41-P46) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the latest demand surge (+55% from the previous baseline). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher volume and the increased volatility needed to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 41: Average demand increased to ~860 units/period (+68% from the Period 30-40 baseline). Lead time volatility persists with 3-period arrivals observed as the conservative planning horizon for major fulfillment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reflects a continued high-demand regime with demand reaching 986 units in Period 47. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P41-P47) is approximately 850 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 3,310 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages, lead times for recent successful arrivals have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P40 took 3, P43 took 2). I am sticking with L=3 for safety. mu_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the surge from ~750 to ~850+, resulting in a base stock target that accounts for the (L+1)=4 period horizon. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the increasing volatility alongside the mean shift. The priority is to satisfy this high demand while managing the risk of periodic batch losses observed historically.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 41: Average demand increased to ~850 units/period (avg P41-P47: 850.1). Lead time volatility persists with a 2-3 period window for recent major orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period. The demand regime starting around Period 41 has shown a strong upward trend, with the most recent three periods (P46-P48) averaging 984 units (930, 986, 1036). This is a significant increase from the 850 average noted in Period 48 carry-over. For Period 49 and 50, I estimate demand at approximately 1050 and 1100 units respectively. Lead time for major recent orders (like P40) was 3 periods, although some arrive in 2. Given we have 3400 units in-transit (P44 order of 790, P45: 196, P46: 512, P47: 82, P48: 90 + backlog of older unfulfilled/lost units), and the game ends at Period 50, placing a large order now is unlikely to arrive in time to satisfy demand (L+1 = 3 to 4 periods). However, I will set 'explicit' parameters to reflect the current high-demand reality (approx 1050 units/period) and maintain L=3 for the backend to correctly calculate the inventory gap, though the 'cap' mechanism and the limited remaining periods mean the primary goal is ensuring any feasible arrivals cover the final period's demand. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*1050 = 4200.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 46: average demand accelerated to ~984 units/period (P46-P48) from the previous ~850 baseline (+16% growth in 3 periods). Lead time remains historically volatile but 3 periods is the consistent threshold for planning major arrivals.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 50 (the final period), we are faced with a significant inventory deficit and a high-demand regime. The current demand regime has accelerated significantly, with Period 49 demand hitting 1,104 units. The average demand since Period 46 is approximately 1,014 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 4,200 units, much of which is overdue (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47, P48, and P49). Historically, lead times have been volatile, peaking at 3 periods for successful arrivals, but we have also seen repeated catastrophic losses of entire order batches after 6+ periods of delay. To maximize final period reward, we must ensure base stock covers the lead time plus current demand. I am setting L=3 based on the confirmed major order lead time from P40. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the latest surge (P46-P49), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this high-growth phase. Since this is the final decision, these parameters aim to capture as much of the pending in-transit inventory as possible to satisfy the current high demand while minimizing the risk of a final stockout.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 46: average demand accelerated to ~1014 units/period (P46-P49) from the previous ~850 baseline (+19%). Supply chain remains unstable with a massive backlog of in-transit units (4200) and evidence of 3+ period lead times.
