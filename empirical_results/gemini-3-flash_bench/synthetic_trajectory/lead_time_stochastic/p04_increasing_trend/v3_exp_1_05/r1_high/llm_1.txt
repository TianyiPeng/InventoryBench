The demand for the last 5 periods was 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. The historical average demand is approximately 115.6 units per period. Since my target is to cover (L+1) periods of demand (2+1 = 3 periods) to ensure a high service level before the next order can arrive, I need roughly 347 units (115.6 * 3). However, the demand trend is currently increasing (last three periods: 107, 127, 160), suggesting a possible upward regime shift or seasonal trend for common snack items. I will forecast a slightly higher average of 140 units to account for this trend. Target stock = 140 * 3 = 420. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 420 units.",

Recent data suggests demand is stable around this mean. The current on-hand inventory is 148. Looking at the supply pipeline: P2 order (120 units) is overdue (promised lead time 2, currently Period 7, no arrival reported in Period 6 conclude); P6 order (80 units) is in-transit. Total in-transit is 200. Lead time analysis: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. This indicates high lead time variability (average ~2). To calculate the order for P7, I aim to cover demand for Period 7 and the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Total target inventory (Pipeline + On-hand) = 3 periods * 105 average = 315 units. Current Pipeline (On-hand 148 + In-transit 200) = 348 units. Although the P2 order of 120 units might be lost, if it arrives, I will be overstocked. However, since the P1 order arrived late and the P3 order arrived early, I cannot confirm P2 is lost yet. Given the high stock level (148 units) relative to one period's demand (~105), and a significant pipeline (200), I will place a small safety order of 20 units to hedge against the possibility that the overdue P2 order is actually lost, while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).",

P24 (630), P25 (320), P26 (320), and P27 (320) total 1590 units. 2680 (total in-transit) - 1590 (recent 4 orders) = 1090 units. These 1090 units are older than 4 periods and, given the established patterns, are almost certainly lost. Therefore, the active pipeline consists only of the orders from P24-P27 (1590 units). Inventory on hand is 0. With a lead time of roughly 3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 28, 29, 30, and 31 (L+1 + safety). Expected demand is ~330 * 4 = 1320 units. Since 1590 units are in the legitimate pipeline (arriving P28-P30), we are currently covered for the immediate 4-period window. However, to maintain the buffer and account for the ~30-40% shipment loss rate observed in the carry-over insights, I will place a standard replenishment order of 320 units to keep the pipeline moving, as stockouts are significantly more expensive than holding costs.",

In terms of lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, recent orders (P38, P39) arrived in 1 period, whereas P40 has not arrived yet (meaning its lead time is at least 2).

These effective units are from P37 (balance potentially), P39 (arrived?), P40 (600), and P41 (0). Re-calculating: P40 (600) + P39 (arrived) + P38 (arrived).
