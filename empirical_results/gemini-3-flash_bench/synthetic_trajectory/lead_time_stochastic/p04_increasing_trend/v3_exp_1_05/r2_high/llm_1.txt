The average demand across these samples is 115.6. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 2 periods (meaning an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4), I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 immediately. However, since the system satisfies demand AFTER the decision, I am actually ordering for future periods. To ensure availability given the pipeline (L+1 approach), I target covering demand for Periods 1-3. Total expected demand for 3 periods (~3 * 116 = 348) minus current inventory (0) and in-transit (0). Given the upward trend in the history (127, 160), I will lean slightly higher to 380 units to establish initial buffer and ensure service level for the upcoming arrival lag.",

However, the 'In-transit' figure of 600 already includes previous orders from P12, P13, and P14. To maintain a service level covering up to 4 periods (L=3 + current period) at a high-end demand of 200 units/period, I need a total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) of roughly 800 units. Current Position: 234 (On-hand) + 600 (In-transit) = 834 units. This is slightly above the target, but given the 17% loss rate and the high profit margin vs. low holding cost ($19 vs $1), it is safer to maintain a consistent ordering pattern.
