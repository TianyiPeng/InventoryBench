Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. There is no historical data yet to confirm actual lead times or demand shifts beyond the provided samples (P1-P5). Demand for the first 5 periods was 30, 49, 48, 65, 56, showing an upward trend or a settling into a mean around 50. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish an initial inventory position. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters based on all 5 available samples to capture the current level (avg ~49.6). I will use the 'default' lead time method since no arrivals have occurred to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 71 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected (due to the 1-period observation delay and L=2), nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). In-transit is currently 71. Demand in Period 1 was 50, and since starting inventory was 0, we have an ending on-hand inventory of 0 and unmet demand. The provided historical data shows demand for Periods 1-5 (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), with Period 1 actually recorded as 50 in the history log (using the log value 50). Since we have very few samples (effectively only one concluded period in the system log) and we are following a standard start-up phase, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize available historical samples to set the base stock. The backend will calculate the order based on (1+L) periods of demand to cover the lead time and the current period.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 140 units in transit (71 from P1, 69 from P2). Historical demand for Regular Chips shows a slight upward trend: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (average ~50). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have already lost sales in P1 and P2 due to the sequence of arrivals, we need to ensure the base stock levels remain robust. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the recent demand average (~50) and volatility. The backend will calculate the order for P3 based on (1+L)*50 = 150 target inventory minus 140 in-transit, which effectively tops up the pipeline for the next expected demand cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first three periods was 50, 45, and 86 (mean \u2248 60.3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 159 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the lead-time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0 for the order of 71 units placed in Period 1. This indicates a delay or a lead time longer than the promised 2 periods. To account for this, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation covers an additional period of demand (L+1 = 4 periods total). For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent samples, especially the spike to 86 in Period 3, balancing the service level against the high holding cost ($1.0/unit).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (Average: 49.6, Std Dev: 13.11). Based on 'conclude' messages, we've seen two arrivals: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 3) and Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 1). The average observed lead time is 2, matching the promise, though variance exists. Current on-hand is 45 units, with 152 in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Since the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to incorporate the observed variance and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full sample set which shows a slight upward trend (65 and 56 in the last two periods compared to early 30s-40s).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (mean \u2248 49.6). In Period 5, demand was 57, and we ran out of stock (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4) and 1 period (P3 order arrived P4). The order from P2 (69 units) is currently overdue if we expect L=2, as it has not arrived by the end of P5 (it should have arrived in P4 or P5). However, P1 arrived in P4 (L=3). I will use L=recent_N (N=2) to acknowledge the volatility in lead times. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand mean and variance since the start, noting that demand is relatively stable but inventory is currently zero. Setting L=2 explicitly or using the calculate method helps the OR backend estimate the pipeline, but given the overdue order, I will stick to 'calculate' to let the backend use all historical arrival data.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 227 in-transit. Demand has been fluctuating with an average of approximately 49.8 units over the 6 historical periods (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50). Lead times are unstable: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting high variance around the promised lead time of 2. Currently, orders from Period 2 (69 units), Period 4 (83 units), Period 5 (29 units), and Period 6 (46 units) are in transit. The Period 2 order is now 5 periods since placement, which is significantly beyond the promised 2 periods and even the observed 3 periods, suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent demand trends. For L, I will use 'calculate' to allow the system to account for the observed lead time variability (range of 1-3). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure the OR backend captures the relatively high demand volatility (86 demand in Period 3 vs 45 in Period 4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed (observed L=1 and L=3). Possible delayed or lost shipment: Period 2 order (69 units) has not arrived after 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with significant lead-time instability. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3, 1, and 3. Most critically, the order from Period 2 (69 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, as multiple subsequent orders (Period 3 and Period 4) have already arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 33, with 144 units remaining in-transit (from Periods 5 and 6). Demand across the last 7 periods averages ~54.7 units. Given the lost shipment (69 units), the OR backend's internal pipeline calculation (which includes the lost units) will overestimate available stock. To compensate and ensure the backend triggers a necessary order, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 3 (the worst-case observed lead time) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~51 over the last 3 periods), while allowing the OR logic to maintain a higher base stock to buffer against lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment Loss Confirmed: Period 2 order (69 units) is 6 periods old and lost (subsequent orders arrived).

Daily Profit: $62.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows significant lead time variability and a confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order of 69 units). Observed lead times are: P1->P4 (3 periods), P3->P4 (1 period), P4->P7 (3 periods), and P5->P8 (3 periods). The arithmetic mean of these observed lead times is 2.5 periods. Given that 3 out of 4 successful arrivals took 3 periods, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the backend accounts for the higher pipeline requirement. Demand appears stable but slightly higher than initial samples; mean demand from the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is (45+57+50+50+64)/5 = 53.2. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly elevated demand regime. Setting L to 3 (explicit) effectively increases the base stock level target to cover the current period plus the 3-period lead time, which helps mitigate the risk of stockouts given the recent history of 3-period delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean shift: 3 out of the last 4 arrivals arrived with a 3-period lead time, suggesting an actual L=3 is more reliable than the promised L=2.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant variability and a recent trend toward L=3 (Period 1 lead_time=3, Period 4 lead_time=3, Period 5 lead_time=3). A shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost. While the Period 8 order arrived in 1 period, setting L=3 provides a safer buffer for potential delays observed in the majority of recent successful arrivals. Current demand (Periods 1-9) averages 53.1 units. The inventory position is 23 (on-hand) + 159 (in-transit) = 182 units. Given L=3, the OR engine covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. 4 * 53.1 = 212.4. Since current inventory (182) is below this, an order is necessary. Setting L=3 explicitly and using recent_N (N=9) for demand will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the observed lead time extension and recent volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 10. Reviewing lead times: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P8(1). The most frequent actual lead time is 3 periods (60% of arrivals), though variability is high (range 1-3). The shipment from P2 is confirmed lost. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 44.6, compared to the global average of 50.6, suggesting a slight downward trend however variability remains high. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed median/mode lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level (44.6 * (1+3) = 178.4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This setup ensures the OR engine aims for a base stock covering four periods of demand (L+1) while accounting for the current zero-stock situation and the in-transit pipeline (190 units).

The most recent pattern suggests a lead time of 3 is more realistic than the promised 2. To compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am looking at the demand history (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28, 64). The mean demand is approximately 51.7. Given the stockout and the lead time of 3, the OR backend needs parameters to cover a 4-period window (L+1). I will set L to 3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 (all available data) to capture the average demand. For sigma_hat, I will use default to allow the backend to calculate the standard deviation across all samples to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer given the high volatility (std dev is ~16).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw arrivals from P9 (L=3) and P10 (L=2), resolving some stockout issues. The current on-hand is low (12). Lead time continues to be volatile, with observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods. Given the previous insight that L=3 is more reliable than the promised L=2 (mode is 3), I will set L to 3. For demand, the recent history (P8-P12) shows values of 31, 28, 64, 63 (avg ~46.5). Using N=5 captures this recent range. Setting L=3, mu_hat with recent_N=5, and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 will adjust the base stock to cover demand over 1+3 periods while accounting for recent high volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out (Ending On-hand: 0). Demand spiked significantly in Period 13 (103 units), while the average remains significantly lower (approx 52). Lead time (L) has historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, but the most reliable recent observation is L=3. Because the current pipeline inventory (188 units) includes the order from Period 13 (55 units), the order from Period 12 (18 units), and the order from Period 6 (46 units - likely lost as it is 8 periods old) and other older potential losses (Period 2), the 'In-transit' count is likely inflated with lost units. I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the true lead time observed. To handle the inventory replenishment, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and the demand jump while smoothing the outliers like the Period 13 spike. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher uncertainty (sigma) and the 3nd-period arrival delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand spike observed in P13 (103 units, +98% vs mean). Period 6 order (46 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift starting at Period 11, with the last four periods averaging 78.75 units (64, 63, 103, 85), which is considerably higher than the initial samples (average ~50). Period 13 and 14 demand (103, 85) specifically signals a potential new high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is 227 units. Regarding lead time, historical data confirms that while the promised L=2, actual arrivals often take 3 periods (observed in orders from P1, P4, P5, P9). Since the P6 order (46 units) is long overdue and confirmed lost, the pipeline inventory used by the OR backend needs to be adjusted; setting L to an explicit value of 3 accounts for the observed delivery delay and effectively increases the target stock levels. mu_hat will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent demand surge and ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current (~79 unit/period) environment rather than the long-term average (~59 unit/period). This aggressive stance is necessary to recover from the current stockout and meet the higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: mean demand increased from ~50 to ~79 (+58% based on last 4 periods).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-volume regime starting at Period 11, with the most recent five periods showing a mean of 80 units (P11-P15: 64, 63, 103, 85, 85). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this level. The lead time analysis remains consistent with a mean of 3 periods (observed lead times are mostly 3, except for occasional variability), which is longer than the promised 2. A lead time of 3 is safer given the recent stockouts (on-hand is 0). Pipeline inventory is significant (297 units), but due to previous lost shipments (P2, P6), the OR backend needs parameters that reflect the current demand reality and the actual lead time to maintain a sufficient base stock level. I setting L to 3 and using the recent 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 265 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 11. The mean demand for Periods 11-16 is approximately 80 units ((64+63+103+85+85+79)/6), a considerable increase from the initial average of ~50. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. Lead time analysis shows that since Period 9, four out of six arrivals had a lead time of 3 periods (P9, P12, P13, P15), while only one had 2 periods and one had 1 period. Given this pattern and the confirmed lost shipment from Period 6, using L=3 is more conservative and realistic than the promised L=2. Setting L to 3 ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (approx 320 units). The sigma_hat will also be calculated using recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this new demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 11) shows a significant increase, with the last 7 periods averaging ~83 units per period. The most recent demand (P17) was high at 104 units. Regarding lead times, while the promised L=2, recent history shows actual lead times of 3 periods (P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16, P17 are all outcomes of L=3 or L=1). Using L=3 for planning is safer to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of high demand. Stockouts have been persistent (ending on-hand=0), and pipeline inventory includes an 88-unit order from P15 (3 periods ago) should arrive soon. Setting L=3 and using recent 7-period demand history (N=7) to better capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand remains high in the new regime (P11-P17 avg: 83), with two of the last five periods exceeding 100 units. Lead time is consistently observed as 3 periods in recent arrivals (P15, P16, P17 all showed L=3 for the primary orders).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, with the mean demand significantly increasing. From P11 to P18, the average demand is approximately 85 units, compared to the previous average of ~50. Recent demand (P17: 104, P18: 96) confirms this high-demand state. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced several stockouts. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful deliveries: P12, P15, P16, P17). Consequently, I am setting L=3 and using the last 8 samples (P11-P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased lead time (L+1=4 periods of risk) and the elevated demand level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, with the mean demand increasing from ~50 to approximately 88 units (average of P11-P19). Lead times have consistently shown a shift from the promised 2 periods to an actual 3-period lead time for the majority of recent shipments (P12, P13, P14, P15, and P16 orders all arrived with L=3 or are trending towards it, with the exception of one L=1 anomaly in P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period, and demand in P19 spiked to 114 units. To address this, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the pipeline inventory covers the longer lead time. mu_hat is set to 352 (representing (1+3) * 88) using the 'explicit' method to reflect the current high-demand regime (last 9 periods). sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime while balancing holding costs and service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~50 to 88 (+76%) over the last 9 periods. Persistent stockouts since Period 18 highlight the need for higher base stock levels.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High demand regime persists, with the last 3 periods (P18-P20) averaging 108.6 units. The product is currently in a severe stockout state with zero on-hand inventory. Lead time history suggests L=3 is more representative than the promised 2 periods (as seen in P15, P16, P17). I am setting L to 3 and using a recent demand window of 10 periods to capture the regime shift that stabilized around 88 units/period. This ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), aiming to replenish on-hand inventory once the current in-transit orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P11-P20 average demand is 88.3 units, a ~76% increase from the initial P1-P10 average of ~50. Recent 3 periods highlight a peak intensity exceeding 100 units/period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 11, with the average demand from P11-P21 sitting at approximately 93 units. Recent demand (P18-P21) has peaked consistently over 110 units. Combined with an observed actual lead time of 3 periods (despite the promised 2), the system has experienced persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0). I am setting L=3 to account for the actual delivery performance. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the higher mean of the current regime. This results in a mu_hat of (1+L)* ~93 = 372. This should help the OR backend calculate a base stock level sufficient to restore service levels and satisfy the elevated demand peak we are currently observing.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed: Demand from P19-P21 averaged 114 units, significantly higher than the P11-P18 average of 83 units, indicating a possible secondary surge or intensified seasonality.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has entered a high-intensity phase. Since Period 19, demand has averaged 116.75 units, significantly higher than the previous high regime average of ~83. The system has failed to capture units due to stockouts for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). With an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 372 units, the objective is to ensure the pipeline covers the expected demand across the lead time plus one period (L+1). Although promised lead time is 2, empirical evidence from recent periods (P15, P16, P17) and historical delays confirms that an actual lead time of L=3 is more representative. For Period 23, I am adopting an 'explicit' L=3 to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, I am using the most recent 4 periods (P19-P22) which reflect the current peak demand surge (mean ~117), setting an explicit value of 468 (117 * (3+1)) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this intensified seasonality/surge. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility of this specific surge.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge confirmed at Period 19: Mean increased from ~83 to ~117 (+41%). Chronic stockouts (0 units sold) observed for 5 consecutive periods despite high demand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a severe and persistent stockout crisis due to a significant demand shift. Since Period 19, demand has stabilized at a much higher plateau around 117 units (P19-P23 avg). However, on-hand inventory has been zero for 6 of the last 7 periods, leading to significant lost sales. To rectify this, the lead time L is set to an explicit value of 3, reflecting the consistent reality of arrivals despite the promised 2 periods (as seen in arrivals on P23). mu_hat is set to 468 based on an explicit forecast of 117 units/period across the lead time plus review interval (L+1=4), ensuring the base stock level reflects the new high-demand regime. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current surge. These parameters are designed to force a high base stock calculation, allowing the capped ordering policy to maximize inflow until the 430 units in-transit arrive and stabilize stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge at Period 19 confirmed: demand has averaged ~117 units over 5 periods, a 41% increase from the previous regime (~83). Chronic stockouts (0 ending inventory) have persisted for 6 consecutive periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a critical stockout crisis due to a significant demand shift. Analysis of the history shows a two-step regime shift: Period 11 saw an increase to ~83 units/period, and Period 19 saw a further surge where demand averaged ~117. Period 24 just recorded a massive 174 units, suggesting either a new peak or increasing volatility. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 468 units in transit, but lead times are highly variable (L=1 to L=3). I am setting L=3 (explicit) because it is the most frequent recent lead time and we must ensure the pipeline covers this extended window. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=6 (covering P19-P24) to capture the newest surge (avg ~126), and sigma_hat also uses recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility seen in P24. This will force a high base stock to recover from the chronic stockouts and meet the intensified demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge intensity increased at Period 24: Demand reached 174 units, which is 50% higher than the previous surge average of 117. Secondary demand regime (P19-P24) mean is now approximately 126 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts: the first at Period 11 (mean ~83) and a second, more aggressive surge starting at Period 19. Over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), the average demand is 136 units, with a peak of 174. The most recent demand (P25) was 115. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while weighting it across the inferred lead time. Analysis of arrivals shows that while promised lead time is 2, actual lead time frequently fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with a 3-period lead time being the safest planning horizon to prevent the chronic stockouts observed since Period 18. Actual on-hand inventory is 0, and despite 410 units being in-transit, the system has consistently failed to meet demand. I am setting L to explicit 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough pipeline demand. I will use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation) during this surge phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge intensity sustained: Mean demand from P19-P25 is 136 units, a 63% increase over the P11-P18 average of 83. Lead time remains volatile but averages approximately 2.3 periods (mode is 3).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand surge that began around Period 19. Recent demand samples show an upward trend: P24=174, P25=115, P26=160. The mean demand for this recent high-intensity regime (P19-P26) is approximately 130 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and there have been consistent stockouts since P18. Lead times exhibit significant variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), though a 3-period lead time remains the most frequent in history. Specifically, the orders from P24 (38 units), P25 (38 units), and P26 (89 units) are currently in transit. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the average lead time experience and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to focus on the high-demand surge regime (P19-P26). This approach targets a base stock level that accounts for the current mean demand of ~130 units across the replenishment cycle, aiming to mitigate chronic stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge intensity confirmed at Period 19: mean demand shifted to ~130 units (based on P19-P26), representing a significant increase over the previous regime (~83). Chronic stockouts (ending inventory=0) have persisted for 9 of the last 10 periods due to insufficient base stock relative to the new demand levels.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two major shifts. The primary shift (Period 11) saw demand rise to ~83 units, and a secondary surge (starting Period 19) has raised the average to approximately 135 units (P19-P27: 114, 116, 114, 123, 117, 174, 115, 160, 141; Mean = 130.4). Chronic stockouts (9 of the last 10 periods) and 0 current on-hand inventory confirm the system is severely under-ordering. Lead times are volatile but recent arrivals (P23, P25) show a range of 1-3 periods with a persistent mode of 3 for major orders. To break the stockout cycle and adapt to the current high-demand regime, I will set L to 3 and use the most recent 9 periods (P19-P27) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~130 units/period demand and the high volatility (sigma) observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge intensity at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand shifted to ~130 units (based on P19-P27 samples: 114, 116, 114, 123, 117, 174, 115, 160, 141), representing a significant increase over the previous regime (~83). Pipeline inventory is high (499 units), but frequent stockouts suggest the base stock level needs to be maintained around 520+ (4 periods * 130 units) to avoid lost sales.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 130 units based on P19-P28 (samples: 114, 116, 114, 123, 117, 174, 115, 160, 141, 100). The recent demand in Period 28 was 100, slightly lower than the surge average but still double the initial baseline. Actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3 in the recent high-demand regime, although the last two arrivals (P25 and P28) showed L=2. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period, a base stock targeting ~4 periods of demand (L+1 + safety) at 130 units/period (~520 units) is necessary. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 433. To reach the target base stock, the OR engine needs parameters reflecting the current high-demand mean and the volatility of this surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the P19-P28 regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the recent arrival performance while maintaining the backend's calculation for a 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P28) confirmed: Mean demand is 127.4 units, a 53% increase over the P11-P18 mean (~83). Chronic stockouts continue with ending inventory frequently hitting 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a high-surge regime that began at Period 19. Over the last 11 periods (P19-P29), the average demand is 129.2 units, a significant increase from the previous regime (~83 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a high in-transit quantity of 433 units, the system has suffered chronic stockouts. Lead time (L) has stabilized back toward the promised 2 periods (recent arrivals from P26 and P28 showed L=2), though some volatility remains. Given the high demand and the goal to minimize stockouts while accounting for the current pipeline, I am setting L to 2, and mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of the current surge (130 * 3 = 390). Using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the current demand regime data (P19-P29) and help the OR backend adjust the base stock to capture this higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand surge regime (P19-P29) continues to hold with a mean of 129.2 units. Recent arrivals (orders from P23, P26) suggest lead time is settling closer to the promised 2 periods, though pipeline management remains critical due to frequent stockouts.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a sustained surge period (P19-P30) with an average demand of approximately 130 units. Recent demand samples (P28: 100, P29: 147, P30: 137) confirm this elevated level. High stockout rates are driven by the OR backend's inventory calculation falling behind the actual demand surge. Lead times have recently stabilized at 2 periods (P25, P26, P28, P30 all saw arrivals consistent with L=2 or matching the promised lead time), though historical volatility suggests a buffer is necessary. To clear the persistent stockouts and address the current on-hand of 0, I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (the length of the current surge regime) to capture the ~130 mean. sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (12) to reflect the increased volatility in the surge regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 19. The mean demand for this segment (P19-P31) is approximately 134 units. We have experienced chronic stockouts for the last 4 periods (P28-P31 ending inventory = 0), and currently have 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times have stabilized around the promised 2 periods (P26, P28 orders both arrived with L=2), although historical volatility suggests planning for L=3 to be safe. Pipeline inventory is currently 410 units, which is high, but the OR backend must maintain a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) demand. Using recent_N=13 for mu_hat (covering the surge regime) will set the base stock level to roughly 536 units (4 * 134), which should trigger orders to replenish the 0 on-hand inventory while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P31) mean confirmed at 134 units, a 61% increase over the previous regime. Lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods for the most recent two arrivals.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a higher regime since Period 19. Calculating demand based on the last 14 periods (P19-P32) shows a mean demand of approximately 134 units. Period 32 demand was 130 units, consistent with this level. Although recent arrivals (P28, P30) suggest a return to a lead time (L) of 2 periods, lead time volatility has historically been high, necessitating a robust L setting relative to the pipeline. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and pipeline inventory is 449 units. There were significant stockouts recently; however, large orders placed in P15, P17, P18 (88, 55, 76 units) appear to be missing or significantly delayed, as they have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the current high-demand regime accurately. For Lead Time, I will continue using 'calculate' to reflect the historical variability while allowing the backend to factor in the recent return to L=2 alongside the previous delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P32) mean confirmed at 134 units. Orders from Period 15 (88 units), Period 17 (55 units), and Period 18 (76 units) are now significantly overdue (14-17 periods old) and are likely lost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 19, with a mean demand of approximately 134 units (confirmed between P19-P33). Recent periods show increasing intensity, with P24-P33 averaging 141 units and recent peak demand hitting 155 units. However, we have experienced 14 consecutive periods of ending inventory being zero, indicating chronic under-ordering and significant lost sales. The pipeline inventory is currently 446 units, but several older orders (P15, P17, P18) totalling 219 units are now 15+ periods old and must be considered lost based on the 'Lead Time Definition' and recent arrivals of much later orders. Lead time (L) has stabilized recently at 1-2 periods. To break the stockout cycle, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=15 (the duration of the current surge) to capture the 134-unit average, while sigma_hat is set to the 'default' (all samples) to ensure the OR backend's service level calculation accounts for the high variance observed during this spike. Calculating base stock for (L+1) periods (3 * 134 = 402) against a 'healthy' pipeline (446 - 219 lost = 227) should trigger a restorative order.

Carry-over insight: Lost Shipments Update: Orders from Period 15 (88 units), Period 17 (55 units), and Period 18 (76 units) are confirmed lost (15+ periods old). High demand regime (P19-P33) mean demand remains stable at 134 units, but ending inventory has been 0 for 14 consecutive periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime initiated at Period 19 remains the dominant driver, with a mean demand of approximately 134 units (P19-P33). Despite significant pipeline inventory (446 units), the system has experienced 15 consecutive periods of zero ending inventory, indicating that the base stock level (governed by \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302) has been consistently underestimated or pipeline arrivals have been too fragmented to meet the surge. Recent arrivals from Periods 32 and 33 show lead times of 1 and potentially 2 (though P34 had no arrival), suggesting L is stabilizing back toward the promised 2 periods, but volatility remains. To break the stockout cycle, \u03bc\u0302 is set to 402 (based on 134 units/period * (L+1)) and \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=16 to cover the surge regime) to capture the high variance of the current seasonal/demand peak. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the persistent ~134 unit demand and prevents further lost sales as in-transit stock arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P34) confirmed: Mean demand is 132.8 units. Ending inventory has been 0 for 15 consecutive periods, highlighting a critical need for base stock levels to stay elevated (target 520+) despite high in-transit numbers.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge starting at Period 19 remains the dominant regime, with a mean demand of approximately 132.8 units over the last 17 periods (P19-P35). Ending inventory has been 0 for 15 consecutive periods, indicating a severe and persistent inventory deficit. While the backend's internal base stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) is designed for a target service level, the presence of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 219 units) means the 'In-transit' figure is inflated by units that will never arrive. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent high-demand regime. Specifically, mu_hat is set to (1+L)*133 \u2248 3*133 = 399. However, because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and the pipeline is artificially high due to lost orders, I will use 'explicit' values to force a higher order quantity. I'll set L to the promised 2 (as recent successes show L=1 or 2). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to overcome the 0 on-hand status and the 'ghost' pipeline units, I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon at 550, which targets a base stock level that accounts for both current demand and a buffer for lost in-transit inventory.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge that began in Period 19 continues to be the dominant factor, with demand reaching 162 in Period 36. Since P19, the mean demand is approximately 134 units. We are currently facing chronic stockouts (17 consecutive periods of ending inventory at 0). While in-transit inventory is high (550 units), previous carry-over insights confirmed that orders from P15, P17, and P18 were lost, implying the effective pipeline is lower than the raw 'in-transit' figure suggests. Specifically, orders of 88, 55, and 76 units (Total: 219) are lost. This leaves a functional pipeline of roughly 331 units. Lead time has been volatile but recently averaged around 2 periods. To break the stockout cycle and cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at the current mean of ~134, the base stock target should be ~402 units + a safety buffer due to high variance. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=18 to cover the regime since P19) and explicit for L to match the promised lead time of 2, as recent arrivals have trended back toward this value.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P36) remains active with a mean of 134.4 units. Total lost units from P15, P17, and P18 confirmed as 219 units, which must be mentally subtracted from 'In-transit' when calculating functional pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge starting at Period 19 remains the dominant feature, with the mean demand for the Period 19-37 regime calculating to 136.3 units. Frequent stockouts and zero ending inventory persist, indicating that on-hand stock is immediately consumed. In-transit inventory is 446 units, but 219 of these units (orders from P15, P17, P18) are confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 227 units. To stabilize service levels, the base stock (mu_hat) must be set to cover at least the lead time plus one period (L+1) at the current demand rate (~136 * 3 = 408). Using 'recent_N' with N=19 captures the entire current high-demand regime, providing a robust estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability between 1 and 3 periods, though recent arrivals suggest a mean closer to the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P37) mean increased slightly to 136.3 units. Functional pipeline is currently 227 units after accounting for 219 confirmed lost units from Periods 15, 17, and 18.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 19, with the average demand increasing to approximately 136 units (P19-P38). Currently, we are experiencing persistent stockouts (ending inventory = 0 for 21 consecutive periods), meaning sold units are limited by arrivals rather than demand. The functional pipeline is calculated by subtracting 219 confirmed lost units (from P15, P17, P18) from the 'In-transit' count of 489, leaving 270 functional units. To satisfy current demand levels (approx 136/period) over the lead time (2 periods) plus the current period (L+1=3), the base stock should ideally be around 408-410 units. Since 270 (pipeline) < 410 (target), the OR backend needs to place orders to bridge this gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to focus the mu_hat and sigma_hat on the current high-demand surge, and set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average, though promised lead time is 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P19-P38) mean is 136.3 units per period. Functional pipeline is 270 units after adjusting for 219 confirmed lost units from P15, P17, and P18. Stockouts have persisted for 21 consecutive periods (P18-P38).

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge that began around Period 19 has intensified further. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), the average demand is 167.4 units, compared to the P19-P34 average of 132.8 units. The most recent demand was 200 units. Stockouts have persisted for 22 consecutive periods. Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P33, P37, P39) have been 1 period, suggesting a shift from L=2 or L=3, though the promised lead time remains 2. Total lost units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 sum to 219; these must be mentally subtracted from the current 'In-transit' of 480 to find the functional pipeline (480 - 219 = 261). To end chronic stockouts in this high-growth terminal phase, I am setting L to 1 (based on recent arrivals) and mu_hat to a value that covers (L+1) periods of the most recent high-intensity demand. I use mu_hat = (1+1) * 170 = 340 to ensure the base stock calculation targets at least 340-400 units, accounting for the 261 units already in the functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge intensity increased again Period 35: mean demand for P35-P39 shifted to 167.4 (+26% vs P19-P34 mean of 132.8). Functional pipeline (In-transit minus 219 lost units) is 261. Recent lead times have consistently been 1 period for the last three arrivals.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts, with the most recent surge starting around Period 35. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 167.8 units, compared to the P19-P34 average of 132.8 units. Lead times for the last four arrivals (P33, P37, P39, P40) have been consistently 1 period, which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the total in-transit is 446 units. However, based on historical evidence, 219 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 are confirmed lost. Thus, the functional pipeline is 227 units (446 - 219). To satisfy the higher demand regime and mitigate persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent 5-period average (167.8) multiplied by (1+L). With L=1, the target base stock is approximately 336 units. Since the functional pipeline is already at 227, the OR backend will order to close the gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Mean demand increased from 132.8 (P19-P34) to 167.8 (P36-P40), a ~26% increase. Actual lead time has stabilized at 1 period for the last four consecutive arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: first to a mean of ~134 (P19-P34) and more recently to a higher mean of ~167.8 (P36-P40). Period 41 demand (150) remains consistent with this higher regime. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been in a chronic stockout state for 24 periods because base stock levels have not kept pace with these shifts. Lead time has recently stabilized at 1 period (observed for the last 5 arrivals: P33, P37, P39, P40), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. To calculate the functional pipeline, we must subtract the 219 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are confirmed lost from the total In-transit of 446, leaving 227 units. Using L=1 (recent evidence) and a daily demand forecast (mu) of 168, the OR engine needs to target a base stock covering (L+1) = 2 periods of demand (approx 336 units). By setting L to 1 and mu_hat to 336 via the explicit method, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach this target, effectively accounting for the functional pipeline deficit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 1 period for the last 5 arrivals (P33, P37, P39, P40, and P41 conclude logic). Demand remains in the high regime (P36-P41 avg ~165).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P36-P42) shows a significant increase to an average of 173.1 units per period, with Period 42 reaching a peak of 223 units. Lead time has consistently stabilized at 1 period for the last five observed arrivals (P33, P37, P39, P40), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and the actual functional in-transit pipeline is 227 units (Current In-transit 446 minus 219 units from confirmed lost orders P15, P17, P18). To address the chronic stockouts and the higher demand regime, I am setting L to 1 (explicit) to match recent performance and mu_hat to 350 (explicit) to cover roughly 2 periods of the current high demand (~175 * 2), ensuring the base stock level is high enough to trigger replenishment despite the large (but aging) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Mean demand increased to 173.1 units (P36-P42), representing a 30% increase over the previous high regime. Lead time is confirmed stabilized at 1 period (5 consecutive observations).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 36, with the mean demand rising to 173.1 units (P36-P43 average: 173.1). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has suffered from chronic stockouts for over 20 periods. Lead time has stabilized at 1 period (confirmed by the last five arrivals from P33, P37, P39, P40, and P41). Total units confirmed lost from Periods 15, 17, and 18 sum to 219 units. In-transit inventory is 446 units; however, after subtracting the 219 lost units, the functional pipeline is only 227 units. With a stabilized lead time of 1, the base stock (L+1 periods) target should be ~346 units (2 * 173.1). Since the functional pipeline (227) is below this target, I will set L to 'explicit' at 1, mu_hat to 'recent_N' for the last 8 periods (P36-P43) where the new mean is established, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility (standard deviation ~26) of this peak regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to end the stockout streak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Mean demand confirmed at 173.1 units (P36-P43), a 30% increase over the previous regime. Lead time is confirmed as 1 period (5 consecutive arrivals). Functional pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 219 units).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a high-demand regime that shifted at Period 36, with mean demand confirmed at 173.1 units (P36-P44 average). Historically, multiple shipments (Periods 15, 17, 18 totaling 219 units) have been confirmed lost, meaning the 'functional' pipeline is significantly lower than the nominal In-transit of 446 units. Functional pipeline = 446 - 219 = 227 units. Although the backend uses the nominal In-transit for its calculation (446), the actual stock available to meet future demand is much lower, leading to the observed persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since P24). To counter this, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 1 (reflecting the 5 most recent arrivals) and mu_hat to 'explicit' at 446. Based on a target base stock for a (1+L) period horizon (2 periods * 173.1 = 346.2 units) plus a buffer for volatility and to compensate for the 219 phantom units in the backend's pipeline logic, mu_hat is set to 446 to force the OR engine to place an order that restores physical availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P36-P44 stabilized at 173.1 units/period. Functional pipeline remains In-Transit minus 219 lost units. Lead time is consistently 1 period for any orders that successfully arrive.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (P36-P45) with an average demand of approximately 173 units per period. Despite this, total in-transit units are high (446), but a significant portion (219 units from P15, P17, P18) is confirmed lost. Subtracting these lost units yields a functional pipeline of 227 units (446 - 219). The ordering strategy must account for this functional gap to end the chronic stockout streak (26 consecutive periods). Lead time has stabilized at 1 period for recent successful arrivals. I will use L=1 and mu_hat=346 (based on 2 periods * 173 units) to target a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand, while accounting for the functional pipeline. The OR backend will subtract the pipeline (446) from the base stock. However, since the OR engine doesn't know about the lost 219 units, I must use an 'explicit' L and mu_hat to force a higher order volume. Setting L to 1 and mu_hat to 665 (approx 173 * (1+1) + 219 + buffer) to trigger a corrective order of ~220 units.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline deficit confirmed: The 219 lost units (P15, P17, P18) remain in system 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to chronically under-order. To compensate, mu_hat or L must be explicitly inflated by ~220 units until the inventory gap is closed.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a critical inventory deficit due to 219 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 being permanently lost but still counted as 'In-transit'. This ghost inventory prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet the current high-demand regime. The demand regime from Period 36 onwards is stable at a mean of approximately 173 units. Lead time has consistently been 1 period for the most recent successful arrivals. To correct for the 219 missing units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Mean Demand + Correction for Lost Units. With L=1 (confirmed) and Mean=173, the required base stock is (2 * 173) + 219 = 565 units. I set L to 'explicit' value 1 to reflect recent stability and sigma_hat to a value reflecting the volatility of the current regime (~25 units per period * sqrt(1+L)).

Carry-over insight: P47: Functional pipeline correction applied. mu_hat explicitly increased by 219 units to offset confirmed lost shipments (P15, P17, P18) that remain incorrectly in the system's in-transit total.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a chronic under-ordering issue due to 219 units of 'ghost inventory' in the In-transit total (Period 15, 17, and 18 shipments confirmed lost). This causes the OR engine to believe the pipeline is 219 units fuller than it actually is. To correct this, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat inflation. The current demand regime (P36-P47) shows a mean of 179.3 units. With an actual lead time (L) of 1, the required base stock is (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. At L=1, the base stock should cover 2 periods of demand (~358 units). Adding the 219 units to compensate for lost pipeline brings the target to ~577. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 577. Since L has stabilized at 1 period for several recent successful arrivals, I will use L=1. Sigma_hat is set to cover the recent high volatility (std of ~25 units over P36-P47 weighted for 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Lost Inventory persists in system: 219 units (from P15, P17, P18) incorrectly inflate In-transit total; mu_hat must be adjusted upward by ~220 to force orders. Lead time remains 1 period for all recent non-lost arrivals.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The current demand regime (since P36) has a mean of approximately 173 units. There are approximately 219 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are confirmed lost but remain in the system's 'In-transit' calculation (total 665). The actual 'functional' pipeline is 665 - 219 = 446. The lead time has stabilized at 1 period for recent successful arrivals. Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (665) from the target base stock, it will under-order. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock for a 1-period lead time (covering 2 periods: today + lead time) at ~173 demand/period should be 346. However, because the engine subtracts the ghost inventory of 219, I must set the mu_hat parameter to 346 + 219 = 565. This 'tricks' the backend into ordering the correct amount to refill inventory while accounting for the lost units that will never arrive. I am setting sigma_hat to an explicit value of 25 to account for the observed volatility in the high-demand regime (max demand 223).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The primary challenge is a systemic under-ordering caused by 219 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are confirmed lost but still reside in the 'In-transit' total (665 units). This causes the OR backend to believe the pipeline is fuller than it is. Demand has been in a high regime since P36, with a mean of approximately 173 units. To force the OR engine to place an order that covers the current demand and replenishes the on-hand stock (currently 0), I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 565. This value represents the required base stock (approx (1+1)*173 = 346) plus the 219 unit deficit caused by the lost shipments. L is set to 1 period based on the most recent 5 arrivals (P33, P37, P39, P40), despite the current long gap which is due to zero orders being placed in periods 41-45. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent demand volatility (N=14 covers the high regime since P36 plus the preceding period).
