The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4. To calculate the order quantity, I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (Periods 1, 2, and 3) to ensure I don't stock out before the first order arrives, plus safety stock. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must order immediately. Average demand (50) * (Lead Time 2 + Current Period 1) = 150 units. Given the variance in the history (ranging from 30 to 65), I will add a small buffer and order 160 units to establish an initial pipeline while I wait for lead time confirmation.",

Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33 (totaling 1486 units) are now well beyond the 3-period lead time window and are considered lost. The 'live' pipeline consists only of the order from P40 (250 units). To cover demand for the next 4 periods (Current + 3-period Max Lead Time) plus a safety stock to account for the risk of further shipment losses, I require a total inventory position of roughly 850-900 units. Calculation: Targeted Position (900) - On-hand (171) - Reliable In-transit (250) = 479 units.
