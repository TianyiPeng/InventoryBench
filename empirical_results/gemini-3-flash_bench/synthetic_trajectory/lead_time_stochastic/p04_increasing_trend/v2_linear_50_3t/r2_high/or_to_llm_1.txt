Expected demand over 3 periods is ~149 units. However, the OR agent applies a cap to smooth ordering and prevent massive overstocking in the first period where pipeline is zero.

Recent demand (P2: 91, P3: 60) in the game history suggests a higher realized demand than the pre-game samples. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it believes the pipeline (221) is sufficient to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 150 units). However, since zero units have arrived and we are currently stocking out, I must consider the possibility of a longer lead time or lost shipments. I will place a conservative order to start building a buffer once arrivals stabilize, but since 221 units are already in the pipeline and the mean demand is ~50-60, adding too much now risks high holding costs if they all arrive at once.

The OR recommendation is 0 because our pipeline and on-hand levels are high compared to the historical demand mean. However, given the lead-time volatility and the risk of a stockout if the Period 2 order (69 units) is lost, a small buffer is safer.

Pipeline Analysis: Current In-transit is listed as 375. Looking at order history: P15 (120 units), P16 (120 units - already arrived in P17), P17 (120 units). Wait, the game history shows P16 arrived in P17 (LT=1). Currently 'In-transit' = 375. Let's trace active orders: P2 (69 - lost), P6 (66 - lost), P11 (80 - arrived P14, but wait P11 (80) arrived P14), P15 (120), P17 (120). Let's re-calculate pipeline: P2(69), P6(66), P15(120), P17(120) = 375 total. Per Carry-Over Insights, P2 and P6 (135 units) are lost. Therefore, effective pipeline = 240 units (P15 due P18/19, P17 due P20). 3. Demand Analysis: Post-P12 demand average is ~105 units per period. 4. Inventory Position: On-hand (92) + Effective Pipeline (240) = 332. Target inventory for (L+1) = 4 periods should be ~420 units (105 * 4). 5. OR Baseline: OR recommends 0, likely because it includes the 135 lost units in its pipeline calculation. 6. Decision: To reach the target of 420, I need 420 - 332 = 88 units.
