Historical data shows demand for the first 5 periods was [30, 49, 48, 65, 56], averaging approximately 50 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To maximize reward, I need to cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3). Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am already facing a stockout for Period 1 because arrivals occur *after* the decision phase. To minimize future lost sales, I must order enough to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 3 periods). Baseline demand is ~50. I will order 150 units to establish a 3-period buffer (50 units/period * 3 periods), adjusting for the 2-period lead time.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P38-P43: 171, 179, 176, 142, 193, 166) averages ~171 units. The previous peak average was ~185. I will forecast demand at approximately 180 units per period to ensure coverage. 3. Lead Time & Loss: Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. I have confirmed a ~30% loss rate historically. P41 (250 units) and P42 (150 units) are currently in-transit. P41 is 2 periods old, P42 is 1 period old. Neither has arrived. P40 arrived in 3 periods (at P43). 4. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 184. In-transit includes P41 (250), P42 (150), and P43 (250). However, the 'In-transit: 2220' in the prompt includes many historically lost orders (1620 units already confirmed lost + P37). Excluding confirmed lost units (1620) and likely lost P37 (200), the active pipeline is P41, P42, P43 totaling 650 units. 5. Order Logic: To cover 3 periods of lead time (L=2, L+1=3) at 180 units/period, I need a target inventory position of ~540 units. Current Position = On-hand (184) + Active Pipeline (650) = 834 units. This is technically over my target. However, given the 30% loss risk, the 'expected' arrivals from the pipeline are 650 * 0.7 = 455 units. Adjusted Position = 184 + 455 = 639 units. Since I am at Period 44 of 50, I must avoid excess holding cost while guarding against the proven volatility and shipment loss. I will place a conservative order of 150 units to maintain the buffer against potential losses in the P41-P43 window.",

Given the 30% loss rate and 1-3 period lead time variability, I must maintain enough inventory to cover the next 3-4 periods (approx. 510-680 units). The current pipeline (550 units) minus a 30% loss expectation leaves ~385 effective units. Total expected availability is 253 (on-hand) + 385 (effective pipeline) = 638. To ensure coverage for the final 5 periods of the game (P46-P50) while mitigating the risk of shipment loss, a moderate order of 150 units is placed to keep the pipeline moving without incurring excessive holding costs as the game nears its end.",

Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and historical data shows a ~30% order loss rate, though recent orders (P41-P43) have all arrived eventually. On-hand inventory is currently high (452 units) due to the arrival of two shipments totaling 400 units in P45. The current pipeline (in-transit) consists of P44 (150 units) and P45 (150 units), totaling 300 units. Given the lead time of up to 3 periods, I need to cover demand for Periods 46, 47, and 48 (approx. 540-600 units). Total current assets (452 OH + 300 IT) = 752 units. This covers the next 4 periods of demand even with potential losses. However, to avoid stockouts in the final periods (up to P50) while accounting for the ~30% loss risk and the high holding cost ($1/unit), I will place a moderate replenishment order to maintain a safety buffer without overstocking as the game nears its end (Period 50).

P44 is now 3 periods out and should arrive at the start of Period 48. P45 is 2 periods out and P46 is 1 period out. Given the game ends at Period 50, orders placed in Period 48 will arrive in Periods 49-51. Only arrivals in P49 or P50 contribute to profit. To cover demand for P48 (approx 180), we have 110 on-hand + 150 (P44 arrival) = 260 available.

This totals 760 units against a total 3-period demand of ~540 units. Since 30% might be lost, the expected arrival is ~532 units.
