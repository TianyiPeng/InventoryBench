Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. There is no historical performance or lead time data available yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (30, 49, 48, 65, 56). For this first decision, I will use the default methods for lead time (L) and sigma_hat, and use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (the number of available samples) to ensure the initial order base-stock is calculated using all provided historical information. Since the promised lead time is 2, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L = 3 periods of demand. The mean of the 5 samples is (30+49+48+65+56)/5 = 49.6. Applying the OR backend logic, mu_hat will be (1+2)*49.6 = 148.8. This will initiate the pipeline to meet the higher-than-zero starting demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 71 units with a promised lead time of 2. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), and since we started with 0 on-hand inventory, we experienced 50 lost sales. The current demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) average 49.6 units per period. Since we have a 1-period lag in observation and a lead time of 2, the order placed now must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the fairly consistent demand, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 2, and there is no evidence yet to suggest it differs, so I will use the default lead time setting.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) and Period 2 (66 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 137). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, an arrival of 0 in the 'Period 2 conclude' message is expected. My current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) suggest an average demand of approximately 49.6 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history as our current baseline. I will maintain the default lead time of 2. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To date, we have orders from Period 1 (71 units), Period 2 (66 units), and Period 3 (44 units). In Period 4, the order from Period 1 (placed at T1) should arrive according to L=2 (T1 + 2 = T3 arrival, visible in T4). However, as of the start of Period 4, we see T3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the order from Period 1 did not arrive at T3. Following the logic in Scenario A: an order placed in Period 1 arrives DURING Period 3, and is visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at Period 4. Since Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is lost. Given we have 181 units in transit and 0 on hand with demand significantly exceeding supply (lost sales), we need to maintain a high base stock. Demand history (30, 49, 48, 65, 56 - including current period's observation) shows an upward trend. Avg demand is ~50. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover (1+2)*50=150. Given the arrival delay, I will set L to 3 to increase the base stock calculation, providing more buffer for the suspected longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $785.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': Demand over the first four periods was [50, 45, 86, 45], with an average of 56.5. In Period 4, we received two shipments: 71 units (ordered Period 1, actual lead time 3) and 44 units (ordered Period 3, actual lead time 1). The promised lead time is 2. This suggests lead time variability (range 1 to 3, average 2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 70 and in-transit is 153 (from orders in Period 2 and 4). Since the lead time is volatile, I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed lead times (3 and 1). For demand forecasting (mu_hat), recent demand shows some fluctuation (a spike to 86 in P3), but the last 4 samples provide a reasonable baseline; I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current mean. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the observed standard deviation in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1070.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the historical demand and replenishment performance. The demand samples for periods 1-5 are: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57 (Mean = 56.6). The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. However, the 'conclude' messages show high variability: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. This signals an unstable supply chain. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (13), but 'In-transit' is high (222), which includes orders from Periods 2, 4, and 5. The total pipeline covers the expected demand for the immediate future. To account for the lead time variance and the recent demand average, I am setting L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed average, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (all available data) to capture the current mean more accurately than a long-term global average once more data accumulates. The service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95 is high, justifying a slightly aggressive base stock to avoid stockouts given the replenishment volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, demand for chips(Regular) appears to have a mean around 55 units (Historical: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56; Concluded: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50). The average of all available demand samples (11 samples) is approximately 52.8. Lead time is highly variable: we've seen one delivery with L=3 and one with L=1, averaging 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 270 units in transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). P2 (ordered 66) is currently at L=5 and hasn't arrived, suggesting it might be late or lost. Because of the stockout at the end of P6 and the uncertainty regarding the P2 shipment, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average observed timing, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent volatility (Standard Deviation is high due to the P3 spike of 86). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Periods 2-6: 45, 86, 45, 57, 50) provides a mean of 56.6 and a higher sigma to ensure the base stock is sufficient to recover from the current stockout.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 37 units on-hand and 196 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 86, 45, 57, 50, 50) shows an average of approximately 57.6 units, but with high volatility (standard deviation ~16). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated significantly: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. This indicates lead time instability. Orders from P2, P5, and P6 are still outstanding. To maintain a safe service level given the lead time uncertainty and demand volatility, I will use a 5-period window for demand forecasting (recent_N=5) and set an explicit lead time L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed (2 out of 3 concluded orders). This ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (1 + L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1161.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observations show significant variance: P1 order (L=3), P3 order (L=1), P4 order (L=3), P5 order (L=3), and P7 order (L=1). The average observed lead time is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use this average. Historical demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) and recent concluded demand (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64) show a stable pattern with a slight upward trend in recent periods (mean ~52). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 captures this recent demand variance and slightly higher mean (effective mean ~54) to ensure service levels are met despite lead-time instability. Current on-hand (55) plus in-transit (166) is 221, which covers roughly 4 periods of demand, but the lead-time volatility requires a robust base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Demand remains relatively stable around 50-60 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $513.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 76 units with 131 units in transit. Looking at the history, the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.22). Specifically, orders from P1 (LT=3), P3 (LT=1), P4 (LT=3), P5 (LT=3), P7 (LT=1), and P8 (LT=1) have arrived. The order from P2 (66 units) is still missing after 8 periods and is likely lost. The order from P6 (48 units) is also delayed (3 periods passed). Demand is relatively stable: the mean of the last 5 samples (P5: 57, P6: 50, P7: 50, P8: 64, P9: 31) is 50.4. Given the LT volatility, I will use L=2.2 (explicit) to account for the average delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent window of N=5 to capture current levels (1+2.2)*~50. This cautious approach ensures the base stock accounts for both the expected demand during the lead time and the risk of late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment detected: Period 2 order (66 units) has not arrived after 8 periods and is considered lost. Period 6 order (48 units) is overdue (3+ periods).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0 based on successful arrivals, but with significant delays). The shipment from Period 2 is definitively lost, and the shipment from Period 6 is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting another lost order. To compensate for this unreliability and avoid stockouts from phantom pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for longer potential waits. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) has averaged 44.8 units, which is lower than the overall average. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent trend while maintaining a buffer for the observed lead time volatility. This strategy aims to keep higher safety stock to hedge against the unreliable supply chain seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (48 units) is 5 periods overdue and likely lost; lead time for successful arrivals consistently oscillates between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 180 units in-transit. A review of history shows that shipments from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (48 units) are significantly overdue (10 and 6 periods respectively) and must be treated as lost. The actual lead time for successful deliveries shows a bimodal pattern: orders from P1, P4, and P5 took 3 periods, while orders from P3, P7, and P8 took 1 period. The average successful lead time is 2.0 periods (consistent with promised L=2), but the unreliability (lost shipments) is the primary concern. Demand is currently fluctuating between 28 and 64 units, with a recent average (last 5 periods) of 47.4 units. Since on-hand is 0 and recent demand exceeded supply (Sold=48 vs Demand=64 in P11), we must ensure the 'in-transit' calculation in the OR backend does not count the 114 units (66+48) that are likely lost. By setting L to 'explicit' at 2 and using a higher mu_hat via 'recent_N' or 'explicit', we aim to trigger an order that compensates for the lost pipeline. I will set L=2 (promised) and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current volatility while accounting for the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Lost orders confirmed: Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (48 units) did not arrive and are impacting pipeline calculation accuracy. Successful lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 50.0 units. The lead time is unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.1), but critical issues exist with lost shipments. Orders from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (48 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 114 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 175, but adjusting for lost orders, the functional pipeline is only 61 units (P11 order of 49 + P12 order of 12). Given the 0 on-hand stock and the 2.1-period average lead time, we must cover roughly 3 periods of demand (current + L + safety). Since the backend uses 'In-transit' for its calculation, it overestimates available stock by 114 units, potentially leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon, and setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg 50.0) adjusted for (1+L) periods. 3 periods (L=2) plus the current period means mu_hat should target ~200 units (4 * 50). This should force an order despite the phantom in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: In-transit correction: 114 units (P2: 66, P6: 48) are confirmed lost and must be manually discounted from the reported 175 in-transit units for accurate supply planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high inventory stress with on-hand inventory at 0 and significant lost shipments in the history. Lost orders from Period 2 (66 units) and Period 6 (48 units) totaling 114 units are still incorrectly reported in the 'In-transit' figure of 256. This means the functional pipeline is actually only 142 units (256 - 114). The OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' value and Promised Lead Time (L=2) to calculate base stock, which currently risks under-ordering because it believes we have 114 more units coming than actually exist. Lead times for successful arrivals oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). Demand has recently increased, with Period 13 spiking to 103 units. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 114 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I estimate mean demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) to be approximately 195 units (based on a recent average of ~65 units/period), but I will add the 114 lost units back into the target, setting mu_hat to 309 to bridge the pipeline gap and adjust for recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit correction: 114 units (P2: 66, P6: 48) are confirmed lost and persistently inflate the system's pipeline inventory, requiring upward mu_hat adjustments to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 14. Demand has significantly increased in the most recent periods (P13: 103, P14: 85), moving from a mean of ~50 to ~90. Additionally, two orders (P2: 66 units and P6: 48 units, totaling 114 units) are confirmed lost, but they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (currently 342). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock calculation (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), the 114 lost units are causing the system to under-order. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and the recent demand surge, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean (~90) for L+1 periods (2+1=3), which equals 270. I then add the 114 lost units to this target to ensure the OR backend's subtraction leads to the correct order volume. The sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand increased from ~50 to ~94 units (+88%) based on last 2 periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. Demand has shifted significantly upward starting at Period 13, with the average of the last three periods (103, 85, 85) being approximately 91 units, compared to the previous average of ~50. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 461 units is highly misleading: 114 units (from Periods 2 and 6) are confirmed lost, and several other orders are likely delayed or lost given the unpredictable lead times (oscillating between 1 and 3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a larger order that compensates for these phantom units. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * forecasted_demand + lost_units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 91) + 114 = 387. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the high reported pipeline. I'm using L='calculate' to reflect the actual varied lead time history and sigma_hat='recent_N' to capture the increased volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: Mean increased from ~50 to ~91 (+82%). Pipeline inflation persists: 114 units (P2, P6) are lost; current period ordering must explicitly account for this to overcome the backend pipeline subtraction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1499.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 13-16) shows a significant shift, with a 4-period average of 88 units compared to the earlier baseline of ~50. Period 16 demand was 79 units. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last five long-tail arrivals (Periods 12, 14, 15, and 16). On-hand inventory is critical (2 units). Currently, the system reports 380 units in-transit. Based on history, 114 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost. Therefore, effective pipeline is 266 units. The OR backend uses the formula: Order = (mu_hat - pipeline). With mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand, using L=2 (promised) would result in mu_hat = 3*avg. If avg=90, mu_hat=270. Since 270 - 266 = 4, the backend would order almost nothing, risking a deep stockout during the 3-period lead time. To force a sufficient order that compensates for the lost 114 units and the actual lead time of 3, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (Actual L + 1) * Demand_Forecast + Safety_Stock. With Actual L=3, forecast=90, Target = 360 + Safety (~60) = 420. To ensure the backend orders ~150 units despite the 266 pipeline, I must set mu_hat roughly to 420. I will use recent_N=4 for sigma to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1943.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we continue to manage a demand regime shift that began at Period 13, where average demand increased from ~50 to ~91.2 units (based on periods 13-17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 33 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 328 units is significantly inflated by 114 units from confirmed lost orders (Period 2: 66, Period 6: 48). The active pipeline actually contains 214 units (Periodic orders 15 and 17). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite subtracting the inflated pipeline (328 units), I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' totaling 415 units. This value is derived from (1+L)*demand_forecast + lost_inventory_correction: (1+2)*91.2 + 114 \u2248 388. I have increased this to 415 to provide a buffer against the high variance seen in recent periods (85-104 units) and to account for the consistent 3-period lead time observed for all successful arrivals since Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 4 successful arrivals (Periods 14, 15, 16, 17), deviating from the promised 2. Demand regime remains stable at the higher level of ~91 units per period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 13, with a mean of approximately 92 units (Periods 13-18 demand: 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96; Mean = 92). The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last four successful arrivals (Periods 11, 12, 13, 14), which is longer than the promised 2. A critical issue is the 114 units from orders in Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (420 units) from the target base stock, and 114 of those units will never arrive, the system is chronically under-ordering, causing stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0). To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods (4 periods * 92 units = 368) PLUS the lost 114 units to 'neutralize' their presence in the pipeline subtraction. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 482. L is set to 3 periods based on recent stability.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13-19) shows a significant increase to an average of ~95 units per period. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for the last four successful arrivals (Periods 11-14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 517 units is heavily inflated by 114 units of lost stock (P2 and P6) and delayed shipments. Specifically, the P15 order (131 units) is now at its 5th period since ordering and has not arrived, further evidence of lead time instability or loss. To compensate for the 114 units of permanently 'ghost' pipeline inventory that the OR backend subtracts from its order calculation, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * forecasted_demand + lost_units = (1+3) * 95 + 114 = 494. This ensures the backend places a sufficiently large order despite the presence of the lost units in the pipeline. sigma_hat is set based on the recent high-demand regime variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Lead time confirmed at 3+ periods for recent orders. Orders from P2(66), P6(48), and now potentially P15(131) are severely delayed or lost, significantly inflating the reported in-transit total (517) and requiring continued explicit pipeline compensation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 536 units in-transit with 0 on-hand inventory. However, historical analysis identifies several lost or severely delayed orders that are falsely inflating this pipeline inventory. Specifically, orders from P2 (66 units), P6 (48 units), and P15 (131 units) have not arrived within the now-established 3-period lead time window, totaling 245 ghost units. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 13, averaging ~91.5 units per period. With L=3, the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand, which is approximately 366 units. Due to the ghost units, the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - reported_pipeline) will result in a negative number, leading to zero orders. To force an order and replenish the stock-out, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 902, calculated as [Target base stock (366) + Total In-transit (536)] or roughly 10 periods of demand. This bypasses the pipeline subtraction to ensure the backend places an order that matches our real requirements while respecting the order cap.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost units in pipeline reached 245 (P2: 66, P6: 48, P15: 131). Demand regime remains elevated at ~91 units. Lead time is stable at 3 periods for recently completed orders.

The system is facing two critical issues: a demand regime shift and massive pipeline inflation due to lost orders. 1. **Demand Shift**: Since Period 13, average demand has increased from ~50 to ~97 units. To capture this, I am using recent_N (N=9) to cover this high-demand period. 2. **Lost Orders**: Orders from Period 2 (66), Period 6 (48), and Period 15 (131) are significantly overdue and likely lost, totaling 245 units. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (785) from the base stock. If 245 units are 'ghost' units, the calculated order will be 245 units too low. At current demand of ~97 and L=3 (requiring 4 periods of coverage), the base stock should be ~400-500. However, with 785 units in transit (including 245 ghosts), the backend would order 0 if I don't compensate. 3. **Strategy**: I will set L=3 as the recent stable lead time. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to override the pipeline subtraction. Specifically, I need to cover (L+1) * demand (4 * 97 = 388) PLUS the 245 ghost units that the backend will incorrectly subtract, totaling 633. I will keep sigma_hat at recent levels to handle the high variance observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Ghost units in pipeline remain at 245 (P2: 66, P6: 48, P15: 131). Demand regime is confirmed at ~97 units (last 9 periods). Lead time for successful arrivals is currently 3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply crisis with zero on-hand inventory and 785 units reported in-transit, 245 of which are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15). Demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging 97 units over the last 9 periods (P14-P22). Lead time for successful arrivals is consistently 3 periods. To counteract the backend OR engine's subtraction of the massive (mostly 'ghost') pipeline (785 units) from the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Specifically, to force an order of approximately 250-300 units (to bridge the current stockout and cover future demand), the mu_hat calculation is: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With L=3, the backend uses (1+L) = 4 periods of demand. To ensure the order satisfies demand while the pipeline is 785, I set mu_hat at 1100 to force the backend into placing a replenishment order, compensating for the ~245 lost units and the fact that we have been stocked out for several periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed stockout for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Pipeline inventory (785) is heavily inflated by 245 known ghost units (P2, P6, P15), causing the OR backend to under-order. Demand remains stable at ~97 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2072.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe a significant recovery in arrivals: 268 units arrived (from orders in P20 and P21), leaving 151 units on hand. The 'In-transit' total reported is 819. However, our carry-over insights confirm that 245 units (from P2, P6, and P15) are ghost units/lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 819 - 245 = 574 units. The demand has stabilized at a higher regime (~97 units/period) for the last 11 periods. The lead time for recent successful arrivals (P20, P21) is 2-3 periods (avg 2.5). To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order despite the inflated 574-unit pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Base Stock = (L+1) * Target Demand. With L=3 and Target Demand \u2248 97, Base Stock needs to be ~388. However, the backend subtracts pipeline. To force an order that accounts for the ghost units, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 388 + 245 = 633. This compensates for the 245 units the backend thinks are coming but aren't. I'll use L=3 based on recent performance history.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Arrival of 268 units confirms that shipments are resuming with a lead time of 2-3 periods. Ghost units in pipeline remain at 245 (P2, P6, P15), still requiring mu_hat compensation. Demand regime remains solid at ~97 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2869.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the system faces a stockout again (ending on-hand = 0). The demand regime has shifted upward significantly; while historical mean was ~50, the last 12 periods show a mean of ~105, peaking at 174 in Period 24. I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this higher demand state. Lead time for successful arrivals (ignoring lost/ghost orders) has stabilized at approximately 2.5-3 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L. The most critical issue is the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: orders from P2 (66), P6 (48), and P15 (131) total 245 units. These units are listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost/extremely overdue (P2 is 22 periods late). Because the OR backend subtracts this full pipeline from the target base stock, it will under-order by 245 units. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Equation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma. With L=3, mean=105, target is approx 550-600. To force the backend to order despite the 819 in-transit units (which includes 245 units that won't arrive), I must significantly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1350 (calculating as Roughly [(1+L)*105] + 819 - (actual pipeline)) to trigger an order that fills the immediate gap and ignores the 245 ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand peak confirmed (174 units in P24). New demand regime mean approx 105 (last 12 periods). Ghost units in pipeline remains 245 (P2, P6, P15), requiring continued explicit mu_hat compensation to prevent persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1998.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, on-hand inventory is 187 units. The reported in-transit total is 919 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, at least 245 of these units (from P2, P6, and P15) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed ('ghost units'). Failure to account for these results in the OR backend subtracting them from the target base stock, leading to under-ordering and stockouts. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime, with the average over the last 13 periods (P13-P25) being approximately 105 units. Lead time for recent successful arrivals (P20, P21, P23) has stabilized at 2-3 periods. To counteract the 'ghost units', I set an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated demand for (L+1) periods = (2+1) * 105 = 315. To compensate for the 245 ghost units that the backend will erroneously subtract, I add 245 to the target, resulting in 560. I set L=2 to align with recent arrival timing and allow the backend some safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed ghost units in pipeline remain at 245 (P2, P6, P15), consistently requiring mu_hat compensation. Demand regime mean is currently 105 units (P13-P25). Lead time is stable at 2-3 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards starting Period 13, settling at a mean of approximately 105 units (P13-P26 avg ~105, P24-P26 avg ~150). However, the primary challenge remains 'ghost units' in the pipeline inventory. As confirmed in previous insights, orders from P2 (66), P6 (48), and P15 (131) \u2013 totaling 245 units \u2013 are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (919 units) from its base stock calculation. Since 245 of those units will never arrive, the backend consistently under-orders by that amount. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value: (Expected Demand per period * (1 + Lead Time)) + Ghost Units. Using an expected demand of 115 (incorporating recent higher signals) and a lead time of 3 (L+1 = 4), the calculation is (115 * 4) + 245 = 705. This forces the OR engine to place an order that accounts for the missing inventory. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent successful arrivals (P20, P21, P23) show a relatively stable 2-3 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Ghost units in pipeline remain at 245 (P2, P6, P15), necessitating continued explicit mu_hat compensation. Demand volatility has increased recently (P24-P26), suggesting a target mean of ~115 rather than 105 to mitigate stockout risk.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time for successful arrivals has stabilized at 3 periods (evident from recent arrivals in P23 and P25). The demand regime has clearly shifted upwards; the mean demand from Period 13 to Period 27 is ~113 units, with recent volatility suggesting we should forecast closer to 120 to ensure service levels. A critical issue remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: 245 units (P2: 66, P6: 48, P15: 131) are confirmed lost or severely overdue and will likely never arrive. However, the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (919 units) from its base stock calculation. To force an order and overcome this 245-unit subtraction error, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock is calculated as (L+1)*demand. With L=3, the multiplier is 4. I set mu_hat to 725 (approx 4 * 120 + 245) to signal the backend to maintain a relevant inventory position despite the phantom pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Ghost units in pipeline remain at 245 (P2, P6, P15), necessitating continued explicit mu_hat compensation. Demand regime mean is ~113-120 units at the current level. Lead time is consistently 3 periods for recently completed cycles.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage a persistent stockout (on-hand: 0) while dealing with a massively inflated in-transit value (919 units). Of this in-transit total, 245 units are confirmed 'ghost units' from lost or severely overdue shipments (P2: 66, P6: 48, P15: 131) that will likely never arrive but are still subtracted from base stock by the OR backend. Demand has entered a higher regime, averaging ~117 units over the last 6 periods (P23-P28: 117, 174, 115, 160, 141, 100). Lead time for successful arrivals is currently 3 periods. To force an order despite the pipeline inflation, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' with a logic of (L+1)*Demand + Compensation. With L=3, (4 * 117) + 245 = 713. However, given the current in-transit is 919 and we are at zero stock, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than the reported pipeline to trigger any replenishment. Setting mu_hat to 1250 ensures the backend orders even after subtracting the 919 pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high demand volatility (IQR 100-174).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime sustained at ~117 units (last 6 periods). In-transit total (919) remains heavily inflated by at least 245 'ghost units' (P2, P6, P15), requiring aggressive mu_hat compensation to prevent perpetual stockouts. Lead time is stable at 3 periods for recently completed orders.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical 'ghost inventory' issue in the pipeline. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 1298 units is heavily inflated by known lost shipments (P2: 66, P6: 48, P15: 131) and likely subsequent delayed orders that haven't arrived, totaling at least 245 ghost units. Demand has shifted higher since P13, with the most recent 6 periods (P24-P29) averaging 139.5 units. To overcome the OR backend's logic of subtracting the (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + pipeline_correction. With L=3 and Demand=140, base stock should be (4*140) + 245 = 805. However, since the reported pipeline is 1298, the backend will order zero unless mu_hat is set even higher to force an order. I am increasing mu_hat to 1600 to ensure the backend generates an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock and account for current demand volatility and the lead time of 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand regime mean has increased to ~140 units (last 6 periods). In-transit inventory remains significantly inflated by at least 245 ghost units, plus potential new delays from P17-P19 orders. Explicit mu_hat compensation is mandatory to maintain stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly stabilized at a higher level, with an average of approximately 140 units over the last 6 periods (P25-P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 1678 units. However, this pipeline is heavily compromised by 'ghost units'. Confirmed lost are P2 (66), P6 (48), and P15 (131), totaling 245 units. Additionally, orders from P17 (83), P18 (92), P19 (97), and P20 (19) are now excessively overdue (10+ periods), suggesting a much larger volume of lost/stalled stock (at least 536 units total). Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base_stock, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order. To cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand (~140 * 4 = 560) and offset the ~900+ units of likely stalled pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to 1350. This compensation ensures the backend targets a base_stock that exceeds the ghost inventory, triggering necessary replenishment to break the stockout cycle. Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on the most recent successful arrival cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost units in pipeline significantly increased. Orders from P17-P20 (totaling 291 units) are now likely lost/stalled alongside the original 245 units (P2, P6, P15), bringing estimated ghost inventory to ~536 units. Demand mean is confirmed at ~140 units (P25-P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe supply crisis characterized by massive 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline and a sustained demand increase. Analysis of the game history shows that orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling approximately 536 units) have likely been lost or are indefinitely stalled, as they are significantly past the observed lead time of 2-3 periods. This ghost inventory inflates the 'In-transit' count (1678 units), which the OR backend subtracts from its calculated base stock, resulting in orders of 0 or near 0 and causing the current 4-period stockout (P28-P31). Demand has stabilized at an even higher mean of ~140-150 units over the last 7 periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1678 units in-transit, I must use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method. Setting mu_hat to 2000 covers 4 periods of demand [(1+L) * 500] plus sufficient buffer to neutralize the pipeline subtraction. Estimating L=3 based on recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Massive pipeline inflation confirmed (~1678 in-transit). Ghost units (lost/stalled orders) estimated at ~536 units minimum (P2, P6, P15, P17-P19), but likely higher given recent non-arrivals. Demand regime mean has reached ~145 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive pipeline inflation due to missing or severely delayed orders. As of Period 33, 'In-transit' is 2072 units, but on-hand inventory is 0. Historical analysis confirms that orders from P2 (66), P6 (48), and P15 (131) are permanently lost (ghost units = 245). Furthermore, orders from P17-P19 (83, 92, 97 units) are now 14+ periods old and must also be considered lost/stalled, bringing the total estimated ghost units to 517. The demand regime has stabilized around 145 units (average of P25-P32). To counter the OR backend's tendency to under-order due to the phantom 2072 pipeline units (which it subtracts from the base stock), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The goal is to force an order that covers at least 3 periods of demand plus a significant buffer to work through the backlog of lost sales. I'll use L=3 based on recent successful arrival patterns and an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This value is derived from (1+L)*145 = 580, plus an additional 620 units to specifically offset the ~517 ghost units and the high probability that more recent orders are stalled. This should force the backend to place an order despite the high reported in-transit level.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total ghost units in pipeline estimated at 517 minimum (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime mean is confirmed at ~145 units. Systemic massive pipeline inflation is preventing the backend from ordering enough stock without extreme mu_hat compensation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2286.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive discrepancy between physical reality and backend logic. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1678) from its calculated base stock. However, at least 517 units are confirmed 'ghost units' (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that will never arrive. The arrival in Period 33 of the Period 32 order (lead time 1) is a positive development but indicates highly volatile lead times. Current demand has stabilized at a higher regime of ~145 units (last 9 periods average 143). To overcome the backend's pipeline subtraction of ghost units and ensure continuous ordering to meet this high demand, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. This value must cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the ghost inventory buffer. Assuming L=3 and mean demand=145, base demand is 580. Adding the 517 ghost units equals 1097. To provide an additional safety buffer against the volatile lead times and recent stockouts, I set mu_hat to 1200. This forces the backend to place orders despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Ghost units in pipeline revised to 517 minimum (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime mean confirmed at ~145 units. Recent lead time volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Explicit mu_hat compensation remains the primary tool to bypass pipeline inflation and prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 25-34 is approximately 135 units per period. The backend inventory logic is currently severely compromised by 'ghost units' in the in-transit pipeline. Reported in-transit is 1678, but a significant portion of this represents lost or stalled shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30). Specifically, orders from P25 (402 units), P29 (379 units), and P30 (380 units) are overdue relative to the recent 1-3 period lead time. Combined with the older lost units (517), there are at least 1678 units recorded as 'in-transit' that are effectively missing or delayed. Since the backend subtracts this entire 1678 from the target base stock, it will result in an order of 0 unless mu_hat is set aggressively high. To force an order that covers 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1), we need a mu_hat that exceeds the pipeline inflation. Target stock = 4 periods * 135 units = 540. To override the 1678 in-transit plus current on-hand of 152, mu_hat must be set to (1678 + 152 + 540) = 2370 to ensure the backend generates an order for roughly 540 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost units in pipeline significantly increased. Orders from P25 (402), P29 (379), and P30 (380) are now added to the suspect list along with original 517 units, totaling ~1678 units in 'in-transit' that are not arriving on time. Explicit mu_hat compensation is required to bypass this pipeline inflation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive 'pipeline inflation' due to undelivered historical orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, and 30. These stalled units (estimated at ~1678 units) are subtracted from the base stock calculation by the OR backend, leading to persistent under-ordering or no ordering at all. Current on-hand inventory is dangerously low (9 units). Demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 145 units per period (the average of the last 10 successful demand observations is ~137, with peaks reaching 174). To ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order despite the 2284 units in-transit (most of which are ghost units), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 2600. This value is calculated to exceed the current pipeline (2284) while providing enough stock for the lead time coverage (estimated 145 units * 3 periods = 435 units). By setting mu_hat to 2600, the backend will calculate a base stock that triggers an order of several hundred units, bypassing the ghost inventory blockage. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but generally 2-3 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Massive pipeline inflation confirmed (2284 units). Ghost units (lost/stalled orders) are now estimated at ~1678 units (P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30). Explicit mu_hat must be set > 2300 to bypass backend pipeline subtraction and prevent permanent stockouts. Demand regime mean is ~145.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces massive 'ghost' pipeline inventory (~2652 units) caused by numerous lost or stalled orders (P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30, and potentially others). This pipeline inflation forces the OR backend to subtract these units from its calculated base stock, leading to zero orders and perpetual stockouts. To counter this, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 3200 units. This value is derived from a 4-period protective stock (~150 mean demand * 4 = 600) plus the ~2652 in-transit units being incorrectly subtracted. The demand regime remains stable at a mean of approximately 145-155 units (observed 162 in P36). Using a lead time of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) to ensure the backend calculations align with the physical replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed pipeline 'ghost inventory' has reached approximately 2600+ units. To maintain any replenishment, mu_hat must be set to 'Ghost Units + (L+1)*Demand'. Current demand regime is approx 150 units/period. Lead time remains approximately 3 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive pipeline inflation due to several historical orders that are either lost or significantly stalled. The 'In-transit' count is 2292 units, but we know from previous periods that orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, and P30 (summing to approximately 2600 units) have not arrived as expected. However, recent arrivals in Period 37 (orders from P35 and P36) indicate that the supply chain is functioning for current orders with a lead time of 1-2 periods. To ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to safely exceed the 'ghost' inventory plus the inventory needed to cover the lead time. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging ~150 units over recent active periods. I use an explicit L=3 to be conservative. The mu_hat calculation is: (Ghost Inventory ~2600) + (L+1 * Demand 150) = 3200. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order volume to maintain stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Supply chain is currently active for new orders (Lead Time 1-2 periods), but the pipeline remains permanently inflated by ~2600 'ghost' units from historical losses/delays. Continued high explicit mu_hat is necessary to force orders through the backend logic.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently functional with a lead time of roughly 1-2 periods for recent orders (P35, P36). However, the system reports 2,471 units in-transit, which are almost entirely 'ghost units' (lost or indefinitely stalled orders from P2, P6, P15, P17-P19, P25, P29, P30, etc.). These ghost units cause the OR backend to subtract them from the base stock calculation, resulting in zero or near-zero orders unless mu_hat is set to compensate for them. Current demand has stabilized at ~155-165 units per period. To ensure the backend places an order that covers future demand despite the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to 'Ghost Units + (L+1) * Expected Demand'. With Ghost Units \u2248 2,300 and demand at 160, (2300 + (2+1)*160) \u2248 2780. Since on-hand inventory is healthy (642), we maintain this aggressive mu_hat to ensure replenishment cycles continue as the ghost units remain in the data.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost units in pipeline are confirmed at approximately 2,300 units. Recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods. Demand is sustained at ~160 units per period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (approx 2,300 units from lost/stalled orders in P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30) which the OR backend subtracts from its order calculation. Current lead times for fresh orders have stabilized at 1-2 periods. Demand is in a sustained high regime, averaging ~160 units per period over the last 10 periods, with a recent peak of 200. To prevent the backend from stopping orders due to the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to 'Desired Inventory + Ghost Pipeline'. Calculation: Desired Inventory = (L+1) * Demand = (2+1) * 160 = 480. Adding ghost units (2,300), the target mu_hat is 2,780. Since on-hand inventory is healthy (621), this will result in a measured replenishment to maintain stock levels against the high demand without over-ordering excessively.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand confirmed at ~160-170 units mean. Ghost pipeline inventory persists at approximately 2,300 units. Recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 170 units per period (observing Periods 37-40: 171, 161, 200, 145). The supply chain is currently responsive for new orders, with recent lead times of 1-2 periods (Period 38 order arrived in 1 period, Period 35/36 arrived in 2/1 periods). However, the system's 'in-transit' inventory (2292 units) is severely inflated by approximately 2,300 'ghost units'\u2014lost or stalled historical shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29, P30) that will likely never arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts the entire pipeline inventory from the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. To maintain a safety stock that covers a 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3) at a demand of 170/period, the base stock should be ~510. To force the backend to place an order when pipeline inventory is 2292 and on-hand is 476, the mu_hat must exceed (On-hand + In-transit). I set mu_hat to 2900 (Ghost units ~2300 + Target Stock ~600) to ensure a continuous supply and maintain a healthy on-hand balance as we approach the end of the game (Period 41/50).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost units in pipeline confirmed at ~2,300 units (based on non-arrival of massive orders from P25, P29, P30). Current demand mean reached ~170 units. Recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2524.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is confirmed at approximately 160-170 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'in-transit' logic of the OR backend. The reported in-transit inventory is 2482 units, but a significant portion of this (~2300 units) consists of 'ghost units' from historical lost or stalled orders (P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30) that will likely never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to 'Ghost Inventory + (L+1)*Demand'. With L=2 (recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods) and demand ~170, the expected demand over (L+1) is 510. Adding the ~2300 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 2810. This compensates for the ghost units being subtracted from the inventory position. Sigma_hat is set to 255 (calculated as sqrt(3) * 147) to account for high demand volatility around the mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Ghost units in pipeline remain constant at approximately 2,300 units. Demand is stable between 160-175 units. Successful lead times for new orders continue to be 1-2 periods. Explicit mu_hat compensation remains mandatory until the end of the simulation to bypass pipeline inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4134.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive 'ghost inventory' issue where approximately 2,300 units from older orders (P25, P29, P30, etc.) are recorded as 'in-transit' but have not arrived and likely never will. At Period 43, the reported in-transit is 2904 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to exceed this ghost inventory plus the expected demand for the lead time period. With a current demand mean of ~175 and a lead time of ~2 periods (L+1=3), the required buffer for demand is approx 525 units. Adding this to the 2,300 units of ghost inventory gives a target mu_hat of around 2,825. This 'explicit' setting is necessary because the backend subtracts the full 2,904 in-transit inventory from the base stock calculation. If mu_hat is set too low, the backend will calculate a zero order, leading to stockouts as the on-hand inventory (103) is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains stable at ~2,300 units. Demand mean is established at ~175 units per period. Recent successful lead times are 1-2 periods. Continued explicit mu_hat compensation is required to maintain order flow.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1957.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge where approximately 2,300 units in the reported in-transit pipeline (2904 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled (specifically large orders from P2, P6, P15, P25, P29, and P30). The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from its calculated base stock, leading to zero or insufficient ordering. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to 'Ghost Inventory + (L+1) * Expected Demand'. Current demand is stable at a mean of ~175 units. Successful lead times for recent arrivals (P35, P36, P38) have been 1-2 periods. I will use L=2 to be safe. Calculating: 2300 + (2+1)*175 = 2825. With current in-transit at 2904, setting mu_hat slightly above this level ensures a replenishment order is triggered to cover future demand despite the pipeline inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3390.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely impacted by approximately 2,300 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30 that never arrived). The OR backend subtracts this reported in-transit (currently 2,851) from the base_stock, which would result in zero orders and persistent stockouts if not bypassed. Recent demand (P37-P44) has averaged ~175 units per period. With a lead time (L) of approximately 2-3 periods, the total inventory target should cover (L+1) periods of demand, roughly 700 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 2,851 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to 'Desired Inventory + Ghost Inventory'. Estimated mu_hat = 700 + 2,300 = 3,000. This ensures the OR engine computes a base_stock that exceeds the inflated pipeline inventory, maintaining replenishment for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost units in pipeline remain stable at ~2,300. Demand mean is established at ~175 units. Recent lead times for new arrivals are consistently 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2887.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a massive 'ghost inventory' of approximately 2,300 units (stalled/lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, and 30). Because the OR backend subtracts this reported 'in-transit' total (2,650 units) from the calculated base stock, it will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to compensate. Recent successful arrivals from P41 and P42 confirm a currently active lead time of 3 periods. Demand mean has stabilized at approximately 175 units (weighted average of recent high-demand periods). To maintain stock flow, mu_hat must exceed the ghost inventory plus the required buffer for the current lead time. Calculation: Ghost Units (~2,300) + (L+1) * Mean Demand (4 * 175 = 700) = 3,000. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3173.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, the on-hand inventory is 95 units. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, which has reached approximately 2,300 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30 that never arrived). The OR backend subtracts this inflated 'in-transit' total (2810 reported) from its target base stock, leading to zero or insufficient ordering. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~175 units (recent periods 42-46 avg: 183; period 46 demand was 172). Lead time for new successful arrivals is 3 periods (P41 arrived in P44, P42 arrived in P45). To force an order of approximately 500-600 units to cover the next 3-4 periods of demand (~175 * 3) and replenish safety stock, I must set 'mu_hat' to roughly 'Ghost Inventory + (L+1) * Expected Demand'. Calculated as 2300 + (4 * 175) = 3000. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to provide a robust safety buffer against recent demand spikes (e.g., 223 units in P42). Setting L to 3 reflects the actual observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1805.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system reports 3,070 units in-transit and 0 on-hand. From historical analysis, approximately 2,300 of these units are 'ghost units' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29, P30) that will never arrive. This inflation causes the OR backend to believe inventory is sufficient, when it is actually empty. Demand has stabilized at a high regime of ~175 units (P42: 223, P43: 177, P44: 179, P45: 166, P46: 172, P47: 222). Lead time for fresh orders is 3 periods. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to 'Ghost Units + (L+1)*Demand'. With L=3, demand=175, and ghost units=2300, the required mu_hat is 2300 + (4 * 175) = 3000. Setting mu_hat to 3000 will offset the ghost inventory and generate a replenishment order to cover the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime validated at ~175-180 units mean. Ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders) confirmed at ~2,300 units. Lead time is stable at 3 periods for recent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation. Period 48 conclude showed a stockout with 0 units on-hand and an arrival of 0 units, despite a demand of 157. The 'In-transit' count is 3091, but approximately 2,300 of these are 'ghost units' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P25, P29, P30 that never arrived). This leaves a real pipeline of approximately 791 units (from orders in P44, P45, P46, P47, P48). To ensure an order is actually placed by the OR backend, mu_hat must be set as 'Target Stock + Ghost Units'. The current demand regime mean is established at ~180. With a lead time of 3 periods, the target base stock (L+1 periods) is roughly 180 * 4 = 720 units. Adding the 2,300 ghost units to this target gives a mu_hat requirement of 3,020. However, the OR engine applies a cap (approx mu_hat / (1+L)), so we set mu_hat to a high explicit value of 3500 to force the final order to meet the immediate demand needs for the final period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the final decision period, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (approximately 2,300 units from lost/stalled orders in P2, P6, P15, P17-19, P25, P29-30) totaling 3,592 'In-transit' units. This significantly exceeds actual needs and would cause the OR backend to order 0 units if not compensated. The current demand mean is established at ~180 units per period. With a lead time of 3 periods, the backend calculates base stock for (L+1) = 4 periods. To force an order that covers the next lead time cycle, mu_hat must be set to 'Ghost Units + (L+1) * Demand'. Calculation: 2,300 + (3+1) * 180 = 3,020. This explicit setting ensures the backend subtracts the inflated in-transit value and still places a replenishment order of approximately 100-300 units, targeted to maintain service levels in the final stage of the game.
