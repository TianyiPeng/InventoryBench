This is calculated using the historical mean (~50) and standard deviation over the review+lead period (1+2=3 periods), then capped. Since pipeline inventory (71) is already balancing out the expected demand for the next few periods, the OR agent is essentially suggesting a quantity to maintain the base-stock level. 4.

Subtracting the lost units (P2=69, P6=65), we get 115 units, confirming the P9 and P10 orders are the only ones left.\n\n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR suggests 0 units because it likely still counts the 'lost' units in the pipeline.

My previous orders yet to arrive are P15 (ordered 75) and P17 (ordered 80). 75+80 = 155. There is an discrepancy in the reported In-transit (289), suggesting there might be unresolved logic or massive delays from older periods still technically 'in-transit' but likely lost. \n3.

I expect the P15 order (75 units) to arrive in P18 and be visible at the start of P19, or arrive during P19.

Demand Analysis: Demand has significantly increased. The last 4 periods show demands of 85, 79, 104, 96 (Average: ~91).

If lead time is 3 periods, Period 15's order (75 units) should arrive during Period 18 (visible in P19 conclude\u2014which it didn't) or during Period 19 (visible in P20 conclude). Since P19 conclude shows arrived=0, and we are currently at P20 START, we can expect the Period 15-17 orders to arrive imminently. 2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0.

The last three reported demands were 96, 114, and 116. Inventory & OR Review: On-hand inventory is 0. The OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (459) is very large compared to its calculated base stock level (which likely lags the recent demand surge). However, with 0 on-hand and recent demand exceeding 100/period, we are currently stocking out. The pipeline contains: P15 (75), P17 (80), P18 (85), P19 (85). Based on a 3-period max lead time, the P15 order was expected to arrive in P18/P19 and the P17 order in P20. The fact that none arrived by P20 conclude (read at P21 start) suggests a temporary systemic delay or potential loss in the pipeline. Strategy: Since the pipeline is already over-saturated with 459 units (enough for 4+ periods of the new demand regime), placing more orders now would only exacerbate potential holding costs once the logjam clears.

The 839 units in-transit are primarily composed of orders from Periods 15-19 (339 units), which are confirmed lost, leaving valid pipeline as Periods 24-26 (380 units), plus any new orders. Demand Analysis: Demand has shifted from a ~50 mean to a higher regime (~115) and now appears to be trending even higher (~145+ over the last 3 periods, ignoring the stockout-suppressed sales). My target is to maintain a pipeline that covers at least 3 periods beyond the current one to account for delivery volatility. Current valid pipeline (P24-P26) = 120+130+130 = 380 units. Expected demand for 3 periods (~150 * 3) = 450 units. OR recommends 0 because it includes the 339 lost units in its pipeline calculation and likely uses a lower historical demand average.

Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized into a higher regime. The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 24-27) is approximately 147.5 units/period. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 989 units in transit versus a base stock level calculation that doesn't account for massive shipment losses or the recent demand spike.

The in-transit pipeline (1009 units) includes orders from P24 (120), P25 (130), P27 (150), and P28 (150). Note: The 'In-transit' indicator shows 1009 units, which includes the large orders placed during the supplier recovery phase and the likely lost orders that haven't been purged from the system counter yet. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized in a high regime (~140-150 units/period). P28 demand was lower (100), but this may be a fluctuations within the high regime. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because the 'In-transit' figure (1009) far exceeds the base-stock target. However, if previous patterns of shipment loss repeat or if the older orders in that 1009 figure (back to P24/P25) fail to arrive, a stockout is imminent. P24 (120 units) is now 5 periods old (exceeding the max observed LT of 3), and P25 (130 units) is 4 periods old. Both are highly likely lost.

Demand Analysis: Demand has shifted into a higher regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 137 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends 0 units, likely because it is factoring in the massive 999-unit 'In-transit' figure which includes the 669 lost units.\n\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 46. The 'Real' pipeline (excluding identified lost orders) consists of orders from Period 29 (140 units) and Period 30 (150 units).

The 'effective' pipeline is much smaller, consisting primarily of orders from Period 29 (140), Period 30 (150), and Period 31 (150).

The 'In-transit' figure of 1899 is misleading due to significant historical losses (documented in Carry-over Insights). The 'Real' pipeline consists of orders from Period 42 (200), Period 43 (200), and Period 44 (200), totaling 600 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was confirmed at Period 43 with demand averaging ~180 units/period (P39-P44 average is 179). 4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the massive nominal 'In-transit' balance (1899) and the capped policy logic. However, since the actual usable pipeline is only 600 units and demand is ~180/period, we need a base stock level covering roughly 3-4 periods (L+1 to L+2). 180 * 4 = 720 units.

Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 278 units, which is quite high. Total pipeline (In-transit) is 1699 units. However, much of this pipeline is likely contaminated with lost orders from older periods (as noted in Carry-over Insights). The 'Real' pipeline consists of orders from Period 44 (200 units), Period 45 (200 units), and the current Period 46 order. Demand Analysis: The current demand regime is approximately 180 units/period (P39-P45 avg is ~ 177). Strategy: With 278 units on hand and 400 'real' units arriving over the next 2-3 periods, we have enough to cover demand for approximately 3.7 periods. Since L+1 coverage (3-4 periods) is the goal, and the OR recommendation is 0 due to the massive (though largely phantom) pipeline, I will order a small amount to maintain the flow without overextending.

Total inventory assets (106 on-hand + 500 reliable pipeline) = 606 units. To avoid a stockout in the final periods while accounting for potential lead-time delays, an additional order is necessary.

Strategy: Since we are in Period 48 of 50, we only have 3 periods of demand left (P48, P49, P50). Orders placed now will arrive in P50 (if LT=2) or not at all (if LT=3).

Currently, no units have arrived since Period 45. Inventory & Pipeline Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. The nominal pipeline is 2099 units, but this is heavily contaminated by the failure of the Period 44-48 orders to arrive (LT is now 5 for P44, 4 for P45, 3 for P46, 2 for P47). Following the pattern established in earlier insights (e.g., Periods 29, 35), orders longer than 3 periods overdue are highly likely lost. The 200 units from Period 44 and 200 units from Period 45 are likely gone. Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized in a high regime (avg ~180). Strategic Decision: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the massive (but likely phantom) pipeline of 2099 units. Since we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final ordering opportunity. Any units ordered now (P49) would arrive in Period 50 if lead time is 1, or arrive after the game ends if lead time is 2+.

Demand Analysis: The current demand regime is approximately 180 units/period (P39-P49 average is ~175). Strategy: We are at the final period (P50), so this is the last ordering decision. The goal is to maximize total reward. However, orders placed in P50 arrive in P51-P53, which is outside the game's horizon.
