In-transit consists of the order from Period 2 (69 units), which is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 4 if LT=2). Given the variability, I assume the 69 units will arrive in Period 5 or 6. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [30, 49, 48, 65, 56]. Mean demand is ~50. Current On-hand (91) covers nearly 2 periods of mean demand. Total pipeline (91 + 69 = 160) covers ~3.2 periods of demand. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 31 units. The OR base stock calculation (for L=2) aims to cover 3 periods (1+L) of demand. (1+2)*50 = 150. Since my current pipeline is 160, the OR raw recommendation would be zero or very low, but it recommends 31 to maintain the safety buffer. Given the lead-time instability and the fact that 69 units are currently 'late' or variable, I will follow the OR recommendation to ensure we don't stock out if the 69 units are significantly delayed or lost, while not over-ordering and incurring high holding costs ($1/unit).",

Period 2 (69 units) and Period 6 (110 units) orders are significantly overdue (P2 is 8 periods late, P6 is 4 periods late) and are confirmed lost. Pipeline Analysis: Current 'In-transit' is 289 units. Adjusting for the lost P6 order (110 units), the effective pipeline is 179 units (Period 10 order: 110 units, Period 7 order: 69? No, Period 7 arrived P8. Currently in transit: Period 10 order of 110 units). Wait, history shows 'In-transit: 289'. Let's audit: P1(arr), P2(lost), P3(arr), P5(arr), P6(lost/in-transit), P7(arr), P8(arr), P10(110 units). If P6 (110) and P10 (110) are in transit, that's 220. The system says 289. This implies another order is floating, likely the P2 order (69 units) which confirms 110+110+69 = 289. Since P2 and P6 are lost, my effective pipeline is only the 110 units ordered in P10.

Historically, arrivals have varied (LT 1 to 3), but recent arrivals (P26 order arriving P28) confirm the supplier is currently meeting the 2-period promise. Pipeline Investigation: The system reports 1099 units in-transit. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', a massive accumulation of orders from P15 onwards (excluding P20, P22, P23, P26) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P24 (120), P25 (120), P27 (120), and P28 (120). Order Analysis: The P24 order (120 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P29) as it's now L+5 since ordering, though P25 (ordered Period 25) is more likely to arrive in P27's resolution, putting us in a precarious stockout position now. Demand Assessment: Demand has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging ~120 units over the last 15 periods. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it misinterprets the 1099 units in-transit as real inventory. With 0 on-hand and only 480 units of 'real' pipeline (most of which will only arrive in P30 and beyond), I must continue ordering to match the demand regime of ~120 units.
