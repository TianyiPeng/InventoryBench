Given the lead time is frequently 3 periods, the P14 order is likely to arrive in P17 (becoming visible in P18). There is a high risk of a stockout in P16 and P17 since the next expected arrival is from the P14 order.

The 'In-transit' figure of 1850 units is significantly inflated by historical systemic order losses. Based on tracking, the total volume of lost shipments (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33) equals 1220 units.

The effective pipeline is therefore 1850 - 1430 = 420 units (orders from P40 and P41). With an expected lead time of 2 periods and a target inventory covering demand through P44 (L+1 + safety), I need approximately 180 * 4 = 720 units in the system.
