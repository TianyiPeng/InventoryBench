{
  "rationale": "Confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (from prior concluded arrivals). With lead time L=3 we must cover L+1=4 periods of demand. Use recent demand: Periods 46\u201349 demands = [22, 0, 298, 0], mean \u2248 80 \u2192 4-period demand \u2248 320. Current coverage: on-hand 143 + in-transit 445 = 588 units, which comfortably exceeds the 4-period demand estimate; ordering more would raise holding cost (holding cost = profit, so overstock is costly). OR recommended 0; given strong pipeline and high holding cost I do not increase orders. Also no new sustained regime shift or lost-shipment signal justifying extra stock. Final decision: order 0 units for chips(Regular).",
