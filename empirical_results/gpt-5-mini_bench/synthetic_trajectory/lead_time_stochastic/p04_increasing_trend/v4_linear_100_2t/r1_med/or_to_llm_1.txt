Decision rule: need to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand after ordering, so target pipeline+on-hand >= 4 \xd7 183 = 732 units. Assessment: in-transit 952 > 732, so pipeline already covers expected demand for the next 4 periods.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 952 units. Demand outlook: recent sustained regime shift to a higher-demand regime was recorded previously (Periods 15\u201319 avg \u2248183); more recent periods show large but volatile demand spikes, so single-period demand estimate ~180\u2013220. With actual L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand; using a conservative high estimate of 220 units/period \u2192 4\xd7220 = 880 units needed. Pipeline (952) > 880, so current pipeline sufficiently covers the next 4 periods including safety stock. Costs: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 extra ordering now would increase expected holding cost without improving immediate sales because inventory already in-transit. OR recommended 0; I concur because ordering would likely create excess ending inventory and incur holding costs.
