Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular): [75,90,0,170,127] (mean=92.4). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals to suggest a different lead time or lost shipments. Use default lead time so backend applies promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to the zero and the high spike in history. No evidence of sustained regime change or lead-time shift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_2. On-hand=0, in-transit=197 (ordered Period_1, not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed so far, so actual lead time cannot be inferred; shipments may still be in-transit. Demand history is limited and shows variability but no sustained regime shift. To avoid overfitting to limited data or prematurely altering lead-time assumptions, use defaults: promised lead time, and demand mean/variance computed from all samples. This balances service level (by relying on OR engine's base-stock using full-sample stats) against holding cost given current zero on-hand and large pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=383 (orders from P1+P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Demand history shows volatile samples (75,90,0,170,127) so use default aggregate estimates to let OR backend compute base_stock using its historical stats and promised L. Choosing defaults keeps parameters consistent with promised lead time and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays while the in-transit stock is still substantial.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=383, recent concluded demands = [132,100,80]. Orders placed earlier have not concluded but we have no concluded arrival evidence to confirm a lead-time change, so keep L at promised (default). To reflect the most recent demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) based on the last three concluded demands (captures current demand level across review+lead). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost while remaining conservative about lead-time shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $788.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrival from Period 1 concluded in Period 4 indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods (one observed sample). Promised L=2 but evidence shows at least one shipment took 3 periods and other orders (Period 2) remain overdue\u2014treat lead time as longer via calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history shows recent elevated demand (historical samples mean=92.4) but with variability; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, giving a conservative replenishment covering review+lead period. This balances service level against holding cost given delayed arrivals.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=400. History shows an observed lead time of 3 periods (P1\u2192arrival in P4); some later orders (e.g., P2, P5) remain unarrived and may be delayed/lost. I set L by 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed 3-period evidence). Demand forecast and uncertainty use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples\u2014this is conservative given the single high spike (P4) and avoids overfitting to the recent dip, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=528. History shows a confirmed longer lead time (observed lead_time=3 from Period1\u2192Period4). No sustained demand regime change detected. Set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting recent noisy periods or risking stockouts given the delayed arrivals.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=528 (multiple outstanding orders; recent concluded demands: 132,100,80,221,70,72,6). Past conclude messages confirm actual lead time=3 (Period1->Period4). Given the confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly=3 so the OR engine plans over the correct review+lead horizon. Demand appears to have decreased recently and is volatile, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (caps N to available samples). This balances service level (by reflecting longer lead time) against holding cost (by using recent demand to avoid overstocking despite large in-transit volume).

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed confirmed lead time = 3 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period5 order arrived in Period8). On-hand=87, in-transit=314. Given confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3 so backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping estimates robust to limited data while accounting for longer pipeline exposure; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against extra holding from longer lead time.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=84, in-transit=406. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=3 (orders from P1 and P5 arrived after 3 periods). Pipeline (406) plus on-hand covers multiple periods, no newly missing shipments. I set L to be inferred from observed lead times so the OR engine uses confirmed actual lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) to let the backend compute demand across the review+lead period using all history; this balances service level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: on-hand=12, in-transit=406. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 3 periods (P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8) so treat actual lead time as 3. Pipeline is large (406) relative to forecasted demand; using explicit L=3 so OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand correctly. Demand samples mean=92.4 \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean -> backend default mu_hat; use default sigma_hat to reflect observed volatility (std\u224863.4) scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given long confirmed lead time) while relying on heavy existing pipeline to limit new orders/holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=450. Historical conclude messages show two confirmed arrivals with lead_time=3 (Period1\u2192P4, Period5\u2192P8) so actual lead time appears 3. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (anchored at 3). Demand sample set is small/no clear recent regime shift, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and substantial pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Recent demand has been volatile with several large spikes (Periods 11-13: 209, 85, 166). On-hand=0, in-transit=487 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals have historically taken 3 periods). Multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=3 (Period1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (Periods 9-13) so the OR engine orders cover (1+L) review+lead demand with tuned variability; this balances higher service needs during spikes against holding cost while respecting the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders observed arriving 3 periods after ordering). Current inventory: on-hand=44, in-transit=521 (total pipeline=565) \u2014 ample coverage but many units are already in-transit under the 3-period lead. Demand in the most recent 5 concluded periods (P10\u2013P14) averaged ~106.4 units/period; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand forecasts with (1+L)=4 review+lead. Thus I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the base-stock on the latest regime, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the OR backend\u2019s base-stock with observed lead-time reality and recent demand, reducing stockout risk while avoiding excessive extra safety when pipeline is already large.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=471. Historical conclude messages show repeated arrivals with lead_time=3 (orders placed P1->arrived P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15) \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time = 3. Using explicit L=3 lets the OR backend size pipeline correctly. Recent demand has been volatile but the most relevant signal is the last 5 periods (P11\u2013P15 demands = 209,85,166,0,119); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the current regime and high variance, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: recent history shows a clear, sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple conclude messages: orders placed in P1/P5/P9/P11/P12/P13 arrived in P4/P8/P12/P14/P15/P16 respectively). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=519 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no same-period arrivals visible yet due to observation lag. Demand has been volatile but recent periods (P12\u2013P16 demands = 85,166,0,119,185) suggest using a short recent window to capture the current regime. Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead-time average (\u22483). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the latest regime, balancing service (capture recent high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $820.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent history shows large and volatile demand with multiple high spikes (e.g., Periods 11,13,16,17). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (covers upcoming demand but includes multiple outstanding orders). Many concluded arrivals consistently show orders arriving 3 periods after ordering, so set lead time to 3. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (robust across full history) and sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-history demand while the explicit L=3 corrects for observed longer lead time, helping the OR engine size orders to cover the extra pipeline delay and balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Demand history shows samples [75,90,0,170,127] (mean=92.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=568 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) with one isolated 1-period arrival (P16\u2192P17). I treat the 3-period pattern as the true regime and use the backend's calculate method to infer average lead time from observed lead times (robust to the single 1-period outlier). Because pipeline is already large, I'll use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using full-history statistics rather than overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. On-hand=0, in-transit=568. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time \u22483 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), so I set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand is elevated and variable; last 5 demands (P15\u2013P19 = 119,185,297,58,76) suggest a higher short-term mean. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given profit=$4 vs holding=$1, while recent-based sigma preserves appropriate safety stock sizing.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand has been volatile with several large spikes (Periods 16-20: demands 185,297,58,76,420) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=752 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show predominantly 3-period lead times, but occasional 1-period arrival exists; to be conservative set L explicit=3. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the latest demand level while the large in-transit pipeline will cap orders. This balances service (cover recent spikes) against holding cost given high pipeline volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=1086 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times: mostly 3 periods (7 occurrences) and one 1-period, average lead time \u22482.75. Recent demand samples show high variability but no clear sustained regime shift in last 3+ periods. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed 2.75 (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to temper new orders and avoid overstock while preserving service level given higher observed lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: recent demand has jumped (Period20=420, Period21=263, Period22=169) indicating a new high-demand regime starting at Period20. On-hand=0 but large pipeline in-transit=1086. Historical conclude messages show mostly 3-period actual lead times (several P#: ordered -> arrived after 3 periods), so use an empirical lead-time estimate. Set L by averaging observed lead times to capture the confirmed shift to ~3. For demand forecast, use recent_N over the most recent 3 periods (Period20-22) to reflect the new regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat as well to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent elevated demand while the calculated L accounts for the longer realized transit time; the OR backend will then compute base_stock and cap accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 24. History shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P20->P23) so actual LT > promised; recent demand (periods ~19-23) is elevated and more variable (examples: 420,263,169,201,317 ending inventory after P23). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend orders for the correct pipeline length. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher regime and for sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility; this biases base-stock toward meeting elevated near-term demand while accounting for higher variability and avoiding excess holding given holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25. On-hand=192, in-transit=832 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 3-period lead times but occasional 1\u20132; average of observed lead times = 2.7, so I set L by calculating the observed average to reflect current reality. Demand history (samples mean=92.4) used with default forecasting: mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to capture multi-period demand, sigma_hat uses default sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to reflect observed volatility. These settings let the OR backend raise the base-stock to cover ~(1+L) periods of demand while the calculated L accounts for the longer-than-promised transit delays.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=421, in-transit=568. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead_times but with many 3-period observations (e.g., orders from P1,P5,P9,P11,P13,P20). Pipeline (568) plus on-hand covers multiple periods of demand; no clear sustained shift in demand mean/variance in recent history. I therefore let L be inferred by the backend from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using all history) while avoiding overfitting short noisy fluctuations or transient late/early arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=313, in-transit=568 (total pipeline strong). Historical concludes show frequent actual lead_time=3 but with some 1\u20132 observations recently \u2014 I use a recent-average lead time to capture this mixed but trending-longer pattern. Demand shows variability and a likely regime shift earlier; to react to recent demand levels I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock covers the most relevant recent demand (balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 28: on-hand=106, in-transit=568. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 3-period lead times but occasional 2 and 1 \u2014 average of observed lead times ~2.64, so I use a calculated average to capture this. Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 201,125,35,108,207) shows a higher recent mean (~135) and some volatility; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend focuses on the latest regime. These choices balance service (accounting for the empirically longer lead time and recent higher demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand shows high variability with intermittent large spikes (recent concludes: demands up to 420, several >200). On-hand=0, in-transit=568 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals have historically been delayed (multiple observed lead_times). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (recent observations skew toward 3 but include 1-2s). For demand parameters I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this is conservative given noisy demand and large pipeline. These choices balance service (accounting for longer realized lead times) vs. holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from observed demand statistics and averaged lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=672. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (multiple 3-period observations, some 2 and a single 1), average observed lead time ~2.6. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime over the last several periods (Periods 25-29 demands = 35,108,207,221,98; recent mean ~133.8). To protect service given uncertain/longer actual lead times and substantial pipeline, set L via calculate (use observed average lead time). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest demand regime so orders respond to recent higher demand while limiting excess holding cost from older low-demand data. This balances service level (higher safety with updated lead time) against holding cost by tying forecasts to the most recent demand behavior.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=672. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (multiple orders ordered at P1,P5,P9,P11,P13,P20 etc. arrived after 3 periods), indicating actual lead time is longer than promised. I set L explicit=3 to capture observed delivery delay so the OR backend plans for a 3-period transit. Demand parameters use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock given the longer lead time and current large pipeline inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=696. Recent history shows repeated concluded lead_times of 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P20->P23) and several late/no arrivals vs promised 2; treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid stockouts. Demand has a clear recent upward regime (Periods 29-31: 98, 305, 509) \u2014 use a short recent window to capture the spike. I set L explicitly=3 to match observed arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new high-demand regime. This raises the (1+L) forecast and safety stock so OR backend orders enough to cover the longer lead time and recent demand surge while acknowledging holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,2,2,1; avg\u22482.45) so I use the calculated average lead time to reflect that variability. I select default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) rather than overfitting to recent noisy spikes; this balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline and mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=567, in-transit=672. Recent concluded arrivals show a clear shortening of actual lead time to ~1 period (Period 31->32 and 32->33 arrivals had lead_time=1). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand; no evidence of new lost shipments. I choose L via recent_N to prioritize the most recent confirmed lead-time behavior. Demand has been volatile with a high recent spike (Periods 29-33); to capture the current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent demand pattern. These settings bias the OR backend toward lower lead-time coverage (L\u2248recent short lead time) while sizing base stock and cap using recent higher mean/volatility to avoid stockouts during the recent high-demand regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. On-hand=210, in-transit=672. History shows variable lead times with many 3-period arrivals but also 2- and 1-period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.38. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has no clear recent sustained regime change; use default demand estimates so backend uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (accounting for longer historical lead times) without overfitting to short recent swings in arrivals.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: recent demand history shows large, volatile demands with multiple confirmed arrivals indicating variable actual lead times (observed lead times include 1,2,3 periods; earlier sustained runs of 3). Current inventory: on-hand=50, in-transit=672 (ample pipeline). Because actual lead time has varied, I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from all observed concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so L reflects realized behavior. For demand forecast and dispersion I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with heavy pipeline on-hand this avoids over-ordering while the base-stock formula balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=703. Historical concludes show multiple orders arriving with 3-period delays (several P arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P23\u2192P26, P20\u2192P23) plus occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals. I set L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times (captures dominant 3-period behavior). Demand forecast uses default (all-samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this leverages the full demand record while the lead-time average handles delivery delay risk. With profit $4 and holding $1, this combination lets the engine pick the base-stock service quantile while the calculated L accounts for observed longer lead times and the large in-transit volume before placing further aggressive orders.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period has on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but earlier sustained evidence confirmed lead_time=3; recent short 1-2 period arrivals exist but are intermittent. Demand recent 5 periods = [91,357,160,284,100] (mean\u2248198.4). With L=3 the review+lead horizon=(1+L)=4 \u2192 implied demand \u2248793.6; pipeline (733) is slightly short so maintain conservative lead time estimate. Choose L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained earlier 3-period lead time signal; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent high-variance regime and let the OR backend compute base_stock and cap accordingly.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=992, recent demand history volatile (samples: [75,90,0,170,127,...,326]). History shows mixed lead times (1\u20133) with several 3-period arrivals earlier; pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages (captures the demonstrated 3-period episodes without overcommitting to promised 2). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this balances service level given high in-transit volume while letting the model set safety stock from full-sample stats. This approach avoids overreacting to recent volatility and accounts for uncertain lead-time behavior and the large current pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent demand has been high and volatile (Periods 35-39 demand: 160, 284, 100, 326, 207). On-hand=52, in-transit=733 \u2192 ample pipeline but past shipments showed variable lead times; however the last several concluded arrivals indicate a sustained shift to 1-period lead time. I set L using recent lead-time evidence to reflect the fast arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (last 5 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N over the same window to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts under the higher recent demand while the updated L reduces required pipeline coverage and holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 1 period (observed arrivals: P31->P32, P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39)

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Recent concludes show actual lead time has shifted to 1 period (observed arrivals: P31->P32, P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39). To prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1 -> high target service level) I set L using recent lead-time evidence. Demand has been high and variable recently; I use recent demand (last 5 periods: P36-40) to capture the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders for (1+L) periods of demand and accounts for recent volatility. This also avoids overstating demand from older low-demand periods and mitigates risk from past lost/delayed shipments since in-transit is large (733).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: recent demand has rebounded (last 5 demands = 100,326,207,132,296; avg\u2248212). On-hand=0, in-transit=733 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals may be staggered; recent conclude history shows actual lead time clustered at 1 period. I set L to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time regime (mostly 1-period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime; mu_hat will therefore represent (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to match volatility to the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given high recent demand while aligning lead-time estimate with observed 1-period behavior.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand (Periods 31-42) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=733 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 1 period since P31->P32 etc. Choose L explicit=1 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=12 to target the recent high-demand regime (Periods 31-42) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand and volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent high demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Historical conclues show lead time has shifted recently to 1 period (multiple P31->P32, P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39). Recent demand has been volatile but last 5 periods (P39-P43) average ~173 units. I therefore set L using recent_N to prioritize recent faster arrivals (N=5). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime and volatility; this keeps target base-stock aligned with recent demand while the large in-transit volume will be offset by pipeline inventory in the OR engine.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 1 period (multiple observations P31->P32, P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39 and carry-over insight). Pipeline (733) already covers several periods of demand so avoid over-ordering. I set L using recent_N to reflect the confirmed short lead-time regime. Demand has shifted up recently (Period41-44 demands = 296,213,17,164) so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods to capture the current regime. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the short lead time and recent higher demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (high service target).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=733. Historical concluded arrivals show recent consistent lead_time=1 (observations: P31->P32, P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39). I set L using recent_N over those 4 recent lead-time observations to reflect the current faster lead time. Demand has shifted higher in the most recent 5 periods (Periods 41-45 demands = 296,213,17,164,292) \u2014 I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and volatility. These choices push the OR backend to target a higher base-stock (high service level given profit/holding ratio) while using recent variability to avoid excessive overstock given existing large in-transit volume.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Recent concluded arrivals show lead time has trended to 1 period in multiple recent arrivals (P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39). Demand in the most recent periods is volatile but the latest 5 periods capture current regime. I set L to recent_N to reflect the empirically short lead time, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent demand regime while accounting for the observed faster arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high in-transit but zero on-hand) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Historical concludes show recent sustained lead time=1 (multiple arrivals with lead_time=1 observed up through Period_40), so I set L explicitly to 1 to reflect the confirmed faster arrivals. Large in-transit stock present so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using full history. This balances service (use confirmed shorter lead time) while avoiding manual over-adjustment given substantial pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=733. Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained short lead-time regime (multiple observed lead_times=1 in P31->P32, P32->P33, P36->P37, P38->P39) so I treat lead time as short. Pipeline (733) is large relative to recent demand samples, reducing need for aggressive ordering. I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=4) to capture the confirmed short lead-time regime. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this avoids overreacting to volatile recent demand given large in-transit stock. This balances service (using short L) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory and profit/holding ratio.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: recent concluded arrivals show lead time = 1 in several recent observations. On-hand=0, in-transit=733 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are only visible next period. I choose L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect the confirmed short lead-time regime (last 4 observed lead times = 1). Demand is volatile recently (last 5 demands: Periods 45-49 = 292, 22, 0, 298, 0); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and captures current volatility. These settings reduce stockouts under the now-shorter lead time while keeping safety stock aligned to recent demand variability, limiting holding cost given high in-transit inventory.
