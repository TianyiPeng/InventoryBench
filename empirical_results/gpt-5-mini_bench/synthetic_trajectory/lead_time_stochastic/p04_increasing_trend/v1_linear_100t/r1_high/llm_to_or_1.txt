  Samples: [('Period_1', 107), ('Period_2', 252), ('Period_3', 298), ('Period_4', 376), ('Period_5', 544)]
  Mean: 315.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (2). Historical samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand 315.4/unit. With L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods, so use default aggregation to let the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level given high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=581 (order placed Period_1, arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Demand history (samples provided) shows increasing demand but insufficient concluded evidence of a regime shift. To avoid premature adjustments given possible delayed arrivals, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies promised L=2 and whole-sample mean/std based forecasts: this balances service vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting confirmed arrivals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=1133 (previous orders pending). Promised lead time is 2 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 still not confirmed), so keep promised lead time. Demand history shows a clear recent upward trend; use a recent-N demand estimate to emphasize latest regime while keeping variance estimate conservative. Thus: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to weight the most recent demand samples, sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level for rising demand against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=1330; no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (P1 ordered=581, P2=552, P3=197 all arrived=0 at their concludes). This is 3 consecutive periods with no arrivals despite promised L=2, suggesting actual lead time is longer or shipments are missing. To be conservative, set L explicit=3 to cover extra delay. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving safety against higher demand while keeping methods simple given uncertain arrivals. These parameters increase pipeline coverage for the next review and trade off some holding cost to avoid stockouts if shipments are delayed.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1-P3 (581, 552, 197) had arrived=0 by Period_3 conclude \u2014 3 consecutive periods with no arrivals; suspect lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5542.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent demand has risen (samples: 107,252,298,376,544; latest demand 544). On-hand=462, in-transit=821; note Period_2 order (552) still not concluded \u2192 possible variable lead time or lost shipment. Observed concluded lead times: P1\u2192P4 = 3, P3\u2192P4 = 1 (mixed). Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecast use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend incorporate all samples and the chosen L; this balances service vs holding given high profit relative to holding cost and recent demand uptick.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8778.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent demand has been rising with high volatility (recent sales: 316, 479) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=1122 with some earlier orders delayed/lost. Observed concluded lead times are mixed but include a 3-period lead (P1\u2192P4) and a 1-period lead (P3\u2192P4); use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile variability. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the upward demand regime from the last 5 samples so base-stock reflects current higher demand and volatility while avoiding overcommitment given in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4)

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=1620, recent demand shows a clear upward regime (last 3 demands: 298, 376, 544). Lead-time observations exist (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4); use a short recent average to reflect latest confirmed observations while letting backend estimate exact L. Set L via recent_N (N=2) to average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher recent mean over the last 3 periods; use the same recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the recent higher demand while backend caps orders to limit excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5111.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: On-hand=0, in-transit=2069. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 in multiple observations (orders P1->P4, P4->P7). I treat lead time as 3 to account for delayed arrivals/lost shipments. Methods: set L explicit=3 to force OR to plan with the confirmed longer lead time. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the clear upward demand regime across available samples; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 5 samples). For volatility, use recent_N (N=5) so sigma_hat reflects recent variability. These choices raise target pipeline to cover 4 periods of demand, prioritizing availability given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $14981.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand has accelerated (conclude demands P5-P8 = 479,616,687,800) vs earlier sample series (107,252,298,376,544). On-hand=219, in-transit=1471 so pipeline is large but demand is high; observed concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) with some 1-period exceptions, so use backend's calculated average lead time. To keep availability for the current high-demand regime I use a recent-demand forecast (last 5 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the elevated mean and variance while letting OR cap limit extreme orders.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=1939. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} \u2192 average = 2, matching promised lead time. Demand history shows no sustained regime shift (recent demands volatile but no 3+ period consistent change). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average lead time (2). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this is conservative given large in-transit volume and unresolved variability. These choices balance service (using observed lead time) vs holding cost (no explicit up-weighting of mean or variance).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demand has been rising (historical samples: 107,252,298,376,544) with very large realized demands in later periods (900+ in recent concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=2485 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but many prior shipments experienced 3-period lead times. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed dominant actual lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples with L=3, letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters. This addresses delayed arrivals while relying on full-sample demand stats to smooth variability.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_12 with on-hand=0, in-transit=2843. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime starting Period_5 (Period_5..Period_11 demands: 479,616,687,800,943,1021,1194). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals = [3,1,3,3,1,1] (avg=2.0). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (aligns with promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5-11); this makes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 7 samples) so the OR engine stocks for the higher demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent spread and ensure safety stock scales with current variability. These choices balance service (capture large recent demand increase) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent regime and using observed lead-time average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg increased from 253.25 to 820.0 (+224%)

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Recent concludes show variable but elevated lead times (observed recent lead times include 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2 \u2192 recent average \u22482\u20133). On-hand=298, in-transit=2387 \u2014 pipeline large and covers several periods of high demand, but past missing/delayed shipments justify using recent observations rather than promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained upward shift (noted at Period 12); recent demands (Periods 8\u201312) are much higher than early-sample mean. therefore: set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N) to reflect current reality; set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 demand samples to capture the new high-demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 5 demand samples to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed higher demand and observed longer/more variable lead times, while the large pipeline mitigates immediate overstock risk.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand is much higher than early samples (Periods 9-13 demands = 943,1021,1194,1137,1381; mean\u22481135). On-hand=0, in-transit=3664; many past shipments were delayed but lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (1+L=4 multiplier applied by backend to recent mean \u22481135 \u2192 targets supply for 4 periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These params prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while acknowledging longer lead time and current high demand to avoid stockouts and lost sales.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=4719. Historical conclude messages show many 3-period arrivals (several P?\u2192P? with lead=3) though some 1\u20132 period arrivals exist; average of observed lead times \u22482.22 so use 'calculate' to let backend set L from observations. Demand clearly shifted up starting Period 5; recent high-demand periods (P10\u2013P14) average ~1,212 units. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility. These choices increase the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the confirmed higher-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=3921. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with many 3-period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.4. Demand has shifted up after Period_5 (confirmed earlier); recent periods (P11\u2013P15) show much higher demand (mean \u22481382 over last 5). To capture the confirmed longer lead-time behavior without overfitting occasional 1-period arrivals, use 'calculate' for L (avg observed). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime (covering P11\u2013P15). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while acknowledging extended/variable lead times and avoiding reliance on old low-demand samples.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=4313. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals recently (P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16) with a couple shorter/2-period events; average of the last 5 observed lead times = 2.8, so I use recent_N (N=5) for L to bias toward the recently dominant 3-period lead time while still reflecting occasional 2-periods. Demand shows a sustained upward regime since Period_5 (carry-over previously noted); to capture the new higher mean and recent variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 12 demand samples (N=12) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the current L estimate. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data raises safety stock to protect service given delayed/lumpy arrivals, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. On-hand=1395, in-transit=1933. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations). Demand shifted up at Period 5 and has persisted (higher demands since), so forecast should use the post-shift regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from promised=2. Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to compute (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the 13-period post-shift regime (conservative window covering the sustained higher-demand regime). These settings bias orders toward service (higher base stock) to capture the sustained higher demand while the sigma estimate from the same recent window controls safety stock.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand is much higher than the initial sample set (sustained high demands since Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=3705 \u2014 several large shipments are already en route. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods consistently (orders placed P1->arrived P4, P4->P7, etc.), so use L=3 to reflect observed reality. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to base demand forecast and volatility on the post-shift high-demand regime (Periods 5\u201318), ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers (1+L) periods of this elevated demand while accounting for higher variance. This balances service (high profit per unit) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=5567. Historical arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times with occasional 1\u20132; average observed lead time ~2.31. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (much higher means since then). To capture confirmed lead-time behavior I use calculated average lead time (backend uses observed arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (Period 5 onward, 15 periods) so base-stock reflects higher demand and recent variability, while relying on L=calculate to account for observed longer lead times and mitigate stockouts given in-transit uncertainty.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_21. On-hand=0, in-transit=5990. Historical conclude messages show mostly 3-period lead times with some 1-2s; average observed lead time ~2.31 -> use calculated average to let backend learn actual mean LT. Demand experienced a sustained high regime since Period_5 (carry-over noted). To capture the post-shift demand, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime length (Period_5..Period_20 = 16 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std over the elevated-demand regime. This balances higher service requirement from the demand shift against holding cost, while L calculated from observed lead times helps account for delayed arrivals already seen.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=6195. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (many periods with ~1100\u20131995 demand after Period 5). Lead-time history shows mixed but elevated values (several 3-period observations and some 1\u20132), so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals. To keep the demand forecast responsive to the sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the current high-demand environment and avoid overweighting early low samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) against holding cost by using recent demand evidence and an observed-average lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=7379. Historical concludes show most arrivals follow a 3-period lag (multiple confirmed P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and many recent orders did not arrive within promised 2 periods. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (recent demands ~1.8k\u20132.2k). I set lead time explicitly to 3 to match observed reality and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N=5 (Periods 18\u201322) to capture the elevated regime mean for the (1+L) review+lead horizon and to keep variability responsive to recent volatility. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 for the same reason to reflect recent demand dispersion and produce appropriate safety stock via the OR backend.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=6609. Historical conclude messages show most observed lead times = 3 periods (many P->P+3 arrivals) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; recent arrivals (Periods 20\u201323 conclude) include P20->P23 (3), P21->P23 (2), P22->P23 (1) but overall 3-period lead-time dominates. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 5 and remained high through Period 23, so use a recent-sample demand estimate rather than the small early-sample mean. Choices: L set to "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures predominant 3-period behavior); mu_hat set to "recent_N" with N=19 to compute (1+L)*mean of the most recent regime (Period 5 onward) so the base-stock reflects the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat set to "recent_N" with N=19 to capture recent demand volatility. These settings steer the OR engine toward stocking for the confirmed high-demand, multi-period lead-time regime while letting the backend compute the exact base-stock and cap.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=7084. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently = 3 periods (many P->P+3 arrivals); earlier missing shipments resolved into a persistent 3-period lead. Demand shifted up at Period_5 (sustained higher demand since then). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=3). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (regime since Period_5 spans 20 samples through Period_24) so the forecast and uncertainty reflect the new, higher-demand regime and recent variability. These parameters prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while using recent demand to avoid underordering given long/confirmed lead time and large pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=6350. Historical concludes show actual lead times \u22483 repeatedly and a sustained demand regime shift to much higher demand since Period_5. To respect observed lead-time behavior I let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). For demand I use recent data to capture the high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent ~20 periods of high demand). This balances service (reflecting confirmed higher demand and longer lead times) against holding cost by relying on recent regime stats rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=7672. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained ~2.2k\u20132.5k in recent periods). To capture the confirmed longer lead time and recent high demand, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N (last 5 periods) to reflect the new high-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (last 5) to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base stock to cover the longer transit delay and the elevated demand while using recent samples to avoid dilution by pre-shift low-demand data.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=9837. Historical conclude messages show many lead_time=3 observations (frequent) though promised=2; averaging observed lead times gives ~2.24. Demand has been high and volatile in later periods (many demands >> initial samples). To capture the realized lead-time pattern I select L by using the calculated average of observed lead times. For demand and volatility I use the defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which leverages full history and scales for the chosen lead time; this balances higher service needs from long/variable lead times against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=8515. Historical concludes show sustained high demand since Period_5 (much larger than initial 5-sample baseline). Lead times have consistently observed as 3 periods recently. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 20 periods of demand to compute (1+L)*mean), and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align pipeline cover for (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability, reducing stockouts given long lead time and high demand without overstating variance from older low-demand samples.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: on-hand=0, in-transit=7001. Recent demands are in a much higher regime (recent five demands ~2309,2427,2565,2733,2915). Lead time previously confirmed as 3 periods; several arrivals align with LT=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I set mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures current demand level while limiting influence of much lower early samples). This balances service (large demand) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (documented earlier). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=9988 indicates many outstanding orders; recent concluded arrivals imply actual lead time \u22483 (frequent 3-period arrivals). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from recent high-demand samples, prioritizing service over holding given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1). This balances filling demand quickly while limiting excess safety stock by using recent data rather than all historical low-demand periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_32. On-hand=0, in-transit=9988 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show mixed lead times (1\u20133) with average ~2.05; demand has been in a higher regime since Period_5 (sustained high weekly demand). To reflect observed actual lead-time behavior I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N (largest reasonable window) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent high demand pattern while the large in-transit pipeline will limit immediate ordering by the OR cap.

Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=9988. Historical conclude messages show persistent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3); recent behavior and prior confirmation (Period_6) indicate actual lead time=3. To target current high-demand regime, use recent demand statistics to capture elevated mean/volatility over the most recent regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to have the OR engine base stock and cap computed from the most recent demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given very high in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 34. On-hand=0, in-transit=12118. Historical concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals (several P->P+3 confirmations) but some 1-2 variability; to hedge unknowns I let backend compute average observed lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 5; recent periods (P29-P33) display consistently high demand, so I base demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 samples to capture the current high-demand regime and recent variability. This balances service (capture elevated demand) vs holding cost by sizing mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent actual demand rather than diluted older low-demand data.

Demand shows a sustained upward regime (noted earlier); use recent_N=5 to focus forecast on the most recent high-demand regime and reduce dilution from the low initial samples. Sigma also set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current high demand while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and limiting overstock given holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=12118 which is slightly below 4 periods of recent demand (~12856) if lead time\u22483. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show multi-period (commonly 3) lead times; use backend-led time estimate (calculate) to capture observed variability. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast and volatility to the sustained high-demand regime (last 5 periods). This balances service (covers immediate 4-period demand window) while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: on-hand=0, in-transit=12571. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent multi-period delays with confirmed lead time = 3 in prior carry-over. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime (shift around Period 5 \u2192 much higher mean since then). To capture actual lead-time behavior I request the backend compute average observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N approach (N=20) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent variability. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the longer inferred lead time and the higher recent demand while the backend caps orders appropriately to limit excessive single-period receipts given holding cost.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=12118. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times with multiple 3-period observations (confirmed earlier) so I'll let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Demand experienced a sustained, large upward regime since Period_5; to capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods of demand (N=5). These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while relying on observed lead-time average to handle delayed arrivals.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Recent demand is in a high regime (recent demands ~3.2k\u20133.7k) vs early samples; large in-transit (13,519) and on-hand=0. Historical conclues show frequent 3-period deliveries (actual lead time often \u22653). I choose L="calculate" so backend infers observed average lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast and volatility to the current high-demand regime (uses last 5 periods' demands), which aligns target base-stock to serve immediate demand while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1. This balances service with holding given sizable pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Demand has been high and rising in recent periods (recent demands in history up to ~3792). Current on-hand=0 and large in-transit=12118 so pipeline is substantial. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1\u20133 periods) with recent concludes showing mostly 1\u20132; average of last 5 observed lead times \u22481.6 so I use recent_N (N=5) to let backend capture the recent shorter lead-time regime. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the full historical demand signal while the chosen L reflects recent lead-time behavior and the large pipeline mitigates stockout risk while controlling holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show varied lead times (many 1\u20133), average observed lead time ~2.05. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead times. Demand has clearly risen to a new high regime; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the latest high-demand periods, which balances service level against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=14447. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (many =3, some =1\u20132), so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 5, but no new sustained changepoint since last insights, so use default demand aggregation over all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These settings let the OR engine incorporate all observed demand history while using the observed lead-time distribution to set appropriate pipeline cover and service level vs. holding-cost tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=14447. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period lead-times early and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_5. To capture true lead-time behavior use the backend 'calculate' (avg of observed lead times). For demand I target the post-shift regime using recent data: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the last 20 demand samples after the large shift) and sigma_hat similarly with recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by sizing base-stock to the recent high-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence rather than the promised value.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages confirm lead time \u22483 periods repeatedly. To align the OR base-stock with the confirmed longer lead time and the new high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent high-demand regime, keeping inventory plans responsive to the sustained demand increase while relying on large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=14789. History shows persistent arrivals with actual lead_time=3 (multiple concluded arrivals at 3). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_5 (sustained large demands). To protect service given confirmed LT=3 and high pipeline, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (cap N at 20 to capture recent behavior while smoothing older low-demand data). This balances higher service needs (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than long-run low-demand mean.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent demand is high (~4k+ per period over last five periods) and many concluded arrivals show 3-period lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=15628 which must cover (1+L) periods. Set L explicitly to 3 (confirmed frequent 3-period arrivals). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (last 5 periods) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet the elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=17694. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period lead times (confirmed earlier) and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting at Period 5. I set L method to "calculate" so backend uses observed average lead time (captures recent mix of 1\u20133d observations). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable high-demand regime (many periods since Period 5); same N=20 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target pipeline to cover the longer observed lead time and high current demand while estimating variability from the latest 20 periods to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 48: demand has been in the high regime since Period 5 (sustained large demands up to ~4.4k). On-hand=0, in-transit=17694 \u2014 substantial pipeline but lead-time evidence from concluded history consistently shows many 3-period arrivals. I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual LT and avoid underordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L) forecast and volatility capture the sustained high-demand regime (uses the most recent 20 demand samples), balancing service level against $1 holding cost by letting the OR backend compute the appropriate z* and capped order. This addresses prior missing/late shipments by using the confirmed LT=3 and recent high-demand data rather than the original low-sample prior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49. On-hand=0, in-transit=17694 (sizable pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. Recent demand is much higher than early samples; the last 5 periods' demands (Periods 44-48) average ~4510 units. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3 (confirmed). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent high-demand mean and volatility across the review+lead period (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This biases orders toward meeting high demand while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given many past lost/delayed shipments.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 decision. History shows actual lead time consistently ~3 periods (confirmed earlier) and large in-transit balance (18626) with on-hand=0. Demand has shifted up materially vs the original small-sample baseline, so I keep L adaptive (backend will compute observed LT average) and set demand parameters using the most recent regime to reflect higher recent demand. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the latest 5 demand samples, which balances service (covering elevated demand) versus holding cost given the substantial pipeline inventory.
