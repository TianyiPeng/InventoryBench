{

Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for the Period 1 order (ordered P1 arrived=0), so the P1 shipment missed its promised arrival (overdue/delayed or lost). The P2 order (ordered P2) is scheduled to arrive during Period 4 (confirmation will appear in Period 5 conclude), so its status is still uncertain. On-hand=0 and in-transit=1380 equals P1(946)+P2(434), but P1 appears overdue, so effective available pipeline may be substantially less than 1380.\n\nDemand and outlook: Historical demands show a clear upward trend (carry-over insight already recorded). Recent realized demands (Periods 1-3) average \u2248232 units, but later periods indicate materially higher demand (Period 4 historically ~376 in provided series). Given the upward regime and current zero on-hand, we must be conservative against lost/delayed shipments.\n\nOR recommendation: OR recommends 0 (it trusts promised lead time and pipeline). I disagree because P1 is overdue\u2014OR may be overconfident that in-transit will arrive on time.\n\nDecision logic and final strategy: We must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand after ordering.
