OR is capped by a 95% single-period cap; that cap under-provisions relative to the expected (1+L)-period demand given the clear upward regime.

  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Promised L=2; the Period 1 order (946) showing arrived=0 is expected (would arrive during Period 3 and only conclude on Period 3 conclude), so treat in-transit=946 as still due, not lost. Inventory math: on-hand=0, in-transit=946. Demand outlook: carry-over insight shows a confirmed regime shift (Periods 3-5 avg = 406 units/period). For decision in Period 2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Target demand over L+1 = 3 * 406 = 1,218 units. Risk/variance: sample std \u2248161, \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a3 * 161 \u2248 279.

Pipeline inventory = 946, so uncapped order \u2248 1,677 \u2212 946 = 731.

Justification: I increase OR's 371 to 671 because the confirmed higher-demand regime (\u2248406/day) requires more pipeline to cover 3 periods; the large profit margin justifies holding extra safety stock, and the cap prevents an excessive single order. This order plus in-transit (946+671=1,617) provides ~3.98 periods of expected demand at 406/day, giving buffer for variance while respecting the OR cap logic.",
