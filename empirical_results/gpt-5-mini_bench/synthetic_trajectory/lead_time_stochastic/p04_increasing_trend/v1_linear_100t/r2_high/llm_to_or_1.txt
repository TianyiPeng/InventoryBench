Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no conclude messages yet so no observed lead-time. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples to seed forecast. Set L to default (promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level (high profit vs holding cost) using the OR engine's base-stock calculation. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_2. On-hand=0, In-transit=581 (ordered in P1, arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals beyond promised lead time, so cannot infer a lead-time change or lost shipment yet. Use promised lead time (default). Use default demand estimates based on all historical samples provided: mean demand=315.4, std\u2248160.93; with L=2 this yields (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (use full-sample mean to cover potential high demand) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=1131 (sum of P1/P2 orders), no arrivals have concluded yet. Both P1 and P2 orders remain in-transit so there is no evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised L=2; do not assume lost shipments. Historical demand samples available show elevated recent demand but only two concluded periods of observed demand (146,166) and the provided full sample set (Periods 1\u20135). To avoid overreacting to limited conclude information, use the backend defaults: keep promised lead time and use all-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps the base-stock aligned with the OR engine's demand estimates while avoiding extra inventory risk given holding cost much lower than profit ($1 vs $19).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=1246. Historical demand samples show a clear upward regime (Period_1..5: 107,252,298,376,544). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating shipments are overdue or lost versus promised L=2. I therefore set L explicitly higher to account for delayed/lost arrivals. For demand I use recent_N=3 (last 3 periods: 298,376,544) to capture the new, higher demand regime for the review+lead period. Sigma set recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed higher demand and overdue pipeline while the larger L compensates for delayed arrivals; using recent samples avoids overstating demand from older low-volume periods.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders from Period_1..3: ordered=581,550,115 but arrived=0 (Periods 1-3 conclude) \u2014 suggests actual lead time >2 or lost shipments; monitor as sustained delay. Demand regime shift: Periods 3-5 avg increased from 179.5 (Periods1-2) to 406 (Periods3-5), +126% \u2014 sustained high demand over 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7824.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation (Period_5): on-hand=270, in-transit=615. Concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed: P1->P4 lead_time=3, P3->P4 lead_time=1) so average observed lead time \u22482. Demand has clearly shifted up in recent periods (Periods 3-5 mean=406 vs overall mean\u2248315). To capture the confirmed shorter recent demand window while accounting for lead-time variability, I set L by calculation (use observed average). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 3-5) to reflect the new higher regime and compute mu_hat over the review+lead period; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to meet elevated demand and variable lead times) against holding costs by restricting the update to recent periods rather than all historical data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5130.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. Recent concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times of 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4); some orders remain overdue (e.g., P2, P5) so I use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 3 (sustained higher demand in Periods 3-5); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (Periods 3-5) to capture the new higher mean and volatility over the review+lead period. This raises target base stock to improve fill rates while sigma based on recent volatility balances service vs holding costs given holding=$1/unit.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=1709. History shows mixed arrivals with a clear instance of 3-period lead time (P1\u2192arrived P4) and several overdue shipments (P2,P4,P5,P6 orders not yet concluded). Demand has shifted up recently (sustained high in last 3 periods). To protect service given observed longer lead time and recent high demand, set lead time explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new high-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N, N=3) and estimate volatility from the same window (sigma_hat recent_N, N=3). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead periods while keeping variance anchored to recent data, balancing stockouts vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: recent demand has been high and sustained (Periods 3-7: 368,426,507,636,618) indicating a regime shift to higher demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=2342; concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 3 and 1 (observed lead times = [3,1,3]) with multiple 3-period observations, and some shipments delayed \u2014 so use observed lead-time average rather than promised. Set L by averaging observed lead times to capture the longer effective lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (last 5 periods) so the OR backend stocks for the new demand level while accounting for elevated variability and the longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14257.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=468, in-transit=1186. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) \u2014 actual lead time effectively 3. Demand has materially increased since Period_3 (recent demands: P3\u2013P8 = 368,426,507,636,618,775; sustained high regime). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering from assumed L=2. For mu_hat/sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (covering Period_3\u2013Period_8) so the OR engine's (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the newer high-demand regime and reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in check given significant pipeline (1186) and on-hand (468).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent demand has accelerated (Periods 5-9 = 507,636,618,775,831) \u2014 sustained high regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=1902 which is short of coverage for a multi-period lead time. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed leads but prior evidence supports longer delays; to be conservative set lead time=3. For demand forecasting use recent data (last 5 periods) to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat based on recent_N N=5 (multiplied by 1+L by backend). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to improve service during sustained elevated demand while the explicit L=3 accounts for observed delayed arrivals.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=2789. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192arrived P4; P4\u2192arrived P7; P5\u2192arrived P8). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained high demands P3..P10). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201310) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and variability over the recent regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts with longer lead time) against holding cost by sizing the base stock to recent higher demand and using recent variability for safety stock.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: demand has been rising steadily (Periods 7-11 average ~870 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=3278 \u2014 with confirmed longer lead times (many observed =3), pipeline nearly covers (1+L) periods but is slightly short. I set L explicitly to 3 (confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the last 5-period mean and volatility multiplied by (1+L). This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given long lead time and substantial pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Recent demand has ramped sharply (Periods 8-12: 775,831,993,1136,1302) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Current on-hand=388, in-transit=2451 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have been erratic (mixed 1\u20133 periods). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the frequent 3-period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor mu_hat to the current high-demand regime (uses last 5 periods mean) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher demand while letting the OR backend compute the safety stock given the inferred lead time and recent variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand is high and sustained (Periods 9-13 avg \u22481087 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=3816 (covers ~3.5 days of recent demand). Observed lead times from concluded messages = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2], average \u22482.125 \u2192 use calculated average lead time so OR backend adapts to observed variability. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 9-13). For volatility use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while using recent data to avoid understock from the clear upward demand shift and to account for observed lead-time irregularity.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent demand has been high and volatile (Periods 10-14 demands: 993,1136,1302,1175,1417). On-hand=0, in-transit=4068 (covers some upcoming demand but arrivals have shown variable lead times). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), average ~2.22 \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Forecast demand using the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures current high mean and volatility from Periods 10\u201314) so base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma captures recent variability to set safety stock accordingly.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: recent demand is much higher (~1,100\u20131,436 over Periods 11\u201315) vs early periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=4065 (covers multiple periods at current demand). Observed concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals (several P->P+3 confirmations) with occasional 1\u20132; I use the calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let the backend estimate L from data. Demand forecast uses the most recent regime (Periods 11\u201315) where demand stabilized at a higher level; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 (captures mean and volatility of current high-demand regime) so the OR engine will raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while capping orders per its cap to limit overstock risk given holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25935.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: recent demand is well above early-sample levels (Periods 12-16 demand = 1302,1175,1417,1436,1578; recent mean ~1382) and confirmed lead-time behavior shows mostly 3-period arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=3817 (sizable pipeline) but many past orders experienced 3-period lead times. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the observed sustained lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime, which helps the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet current demand while the explicit L captures the longer arrival delay and avoids under-ordering during in-transit gaps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29862.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18. Multiple concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period actual lead time (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) \u2014 treat L=3. Recent demand is in a higher regime; last 5 realized demands (Periods 13-17 = 1175,1417,1436,1578,1586) average 1438.4, so I use recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L=4). On-hand (272) + in-transit (3590)=3862 provides coverage but pipeline timing follows LT\u22483; using recent_N increases target base stock to avoid stockouts given higher demand and observed long lead times.

These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given observed LT=3 and recent elevated demand while letting the engine compute service-level safety stock using profit/holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand is high and rising (Periods16-20 demands = 1578,1586,1862,1750,2032; mean\u22481762). On-hand=0, in-transit=6889 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show persistent 3-period lead times across many orders (confirmed P1\u2192P4, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, etc.) and some 1-period anomalies\u2014overall actual lead time appears longer than promised. I choose L by "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483). For demand I use "recent_N" with N=5 to focus the base-stock on the most recent high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). For sigma I use "recent_N" N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This combination raises target inventory to cover the sustained higher demand while the backend cap prevents extreme over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=7171. Historical concluded arrivals show predominantly 3-period lead times (many observed W=3 with occasional W=1 or 2) so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has settled at a higher regime recently; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17\u201321) average \u22481871, so I anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 samples to reflect current high-demand regime and keep pipeline aligned with in-transit. This raises target inventory (1+L)\xd7recent mean to match observed flows and reduces stockout risk given delayed/lost shipments.

On-hand=0, in-transit=7665\u2014large pipeline but many past shipments showed multi-period delays (most concluded lead_times = 3). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed ~3-period reality). For demand and volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime and shorten responsiveness to earlier low-demand samples. This raises base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current high demand while sigma based on recent variability controls the safety stock; together these choices prioritize service (reduce lost sales) while limiting excess holding given a high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_24. On-hand=0, in-transit=7378. Recent demand is much higher than early periods (e.g., Periods19-23 demands = 1750,2032,2126,2270,2186). Lead-time history shows many 3-period observations earlier but some 1-2 period concludes recently; use calculated average of observed lead times. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained high-demand regime reflected in the last five periods (reduces underordering). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to cover the current high-demand regime while reflecting recent variability, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain but elevated demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=8369. Historical concluded lead times show variability but recent pattern averages ~2 periods; demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (sustained elevated weekly demands). I set L via recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time behavior (N=5) so the OR engine orders anticipating slightly longer arrivals than promised. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N N=5 to anchor the forecast to the sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean elevated), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the current high demand while keeping safety sizing responsive to recent lead-time realizations and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent demand has been high and volatile (many multi-thousand demands in Periods 12\u201325); on-hand=0, in-transit=8536 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 3 but with some 1\u20132s; average observed lead time is >2. To capture realized lead-time behavior I request backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances service level and holding cost given the large pipeline and high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=8536. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period deliveries and some 1-2 period arrivals; use observed average lead time rather than promised to reflect variability. Demand has been in a high regime for many periods; to capture current level I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock covers the current elevated demand over the review+lead horizon while keeping volatility responsive to recent weeks.

Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=9288; recent demand has been in a sustained high regime (~2.4k units). Historical concluded lead-times show variability but average >2. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed drift. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 periods: Periods 23-27) to capture the sustained high-demand regime when computing (1+L)*mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (last 5) to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while using recent demand to avoid under-ordering given large in-transit but long/variable lead-times.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=9433. Recent demand is very high (last five periods demand: Period_24..28 = 2504,2479,2457,2508,2890). Historical arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3) and occasional 1-2; some orders were delayed or lost earlier. Pipeline (9433) must cover review+lead demand. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (evidence of actual LT \u22483). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands) to capture the current high-demand regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock to recent high demand while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock from older low-demand periods. Flags: large in-transit exists but on-hand is zero; expect arrivals in upcoming concludes given observed variable lead times.

Observed lead times vary with many 3-period observations; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets cover the elevated demand and volatility while the backend cap limits excessive ordering given delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent demand is much higher than early periods: last 5 demands (Periods 26-30) = [2457,2508,2890,2959,3004], recent mean ~2764 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=10456 units (covers ~3.8 recent-periods of demand). Historical concluded arrivals show variable but mostly multi-period lead times (many 3s, several 2s and 1s) \u2014 average observed lead time \u22482.17. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses the empirical average. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime (most recent 5 periods), so the base-stock and caps reflect current elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older, lower-demand data. This choice keeps adequate pipeline (in-transit already large) and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: demand has been rising steadily (recent demands ~2508\u20133152), on-hand=0, in-transit=11008 (several past delayed arrivals => mix of LT=2\u20133 observed, many =3). Use lead-time 'calculate' to let backend average observed L (captures persistent 3-period realizations). For demand, use recent_N N=5 (use last 5 periods' demands) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; apply same recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This ensures base_stock targets the current elevated mean while sigma_hat captures recent variability; choosing recent samples avoids diluting the forecast with much lower early-period demand and helps balance service level vs holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent demand is very high (recent periods ~2,800\u20133,150); on-hand=0, in-transit=10,878 \u2014 substantial pipeline but demand remains large so keep forecast responsive. Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 3, some 1\u20132); average of observed lead times \u22482.1 \u2192 use calculated average lead time so backend accounts for realized variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand history (keeps forecast anchored to full-sample mean/volatility given high recent volatility). This balances service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) against holding cost while letting backend apply safety-stock formula.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_34: demand has been at a sustained higher regime since Periods 3-5 and subsequent periods (large demands observed). On-hand=0, in-transit=10456 \u2014 substantial pipeline but past history shows arrivals often take 3 periods. I select L using 'calculate' so backend infers the empiric average observed lead time (captures frequent 3-period actuals). For demand forecast I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples), letting backend apply full-sample mean scaled by the inferred L; sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (accounting for longer empirical lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent demand is high and stable (Periods 30-34 demand ~3004,3152,3151,3344,3383). On-hand=0, in-transit=10456 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead-times (most recent 5 observed): 1,1,2,2,2 \u2192 suggests lead time has shortened vs earlier 3-period episodes. To match recent regime I set L via recent_N to capture the recent lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (last 5 demand samples) so the OR base-stock reflects the current high-demand regime while limiting excess holding by using recent rather than all-sample statistics. This balances high service (to avoid lost sales given large demand) against holding cost by sizing targets to the recent high mean and measured recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears to have shortened in recent observations: last 5 observed lead times = [1,1,2,2,2], average 1.6 (evidence over 5 observations).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36. On-hand=0, in-transit=10456 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show recent shortening (last 5 observed lead times avg ~1.6). Demand has been in a sustained high regime recently; last 5 demands (P31-35) = [3152,3151,3344,3383,3624], mean \u22483331. To reflect faster recent arrivals while anchoring forecast to the latest high-demand regime, I set L to recent_N (N=5) to let the OR engine use the recent observed lead-time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility use the most recent high-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat for very high demand) with holding cost awareness given a large in-transit pipeline and shorter observed lead times.

Historical concluded lead times show shortening (recent observed LT samples average ~1.6). To capture current faster deliveries and recent high demand, I set L via recent_N (N=5) to weight latest observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=10) to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 10 demand observations so the OR engine targets service for the high-demand regime while recognizing shorter recent lead times and large pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=10456. Recent demand is high and stable (last 5 demands ~3344,3383,3624,3457,3817) so forecast should use recent regime. Recent observed lead times have shortened (last 5 observed LT avg ~1.6), so use a recent_N lead-time estimate. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current high mean and variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost by reflecting the shorter recent lead time and elevated demand volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=10456. Historical concludes show lead times varying 1\u20133 with recent five observed lead times = [1,1,2,2,2] (avg 1.6) \u2014 actual lead time appears shorter than earlier 3 but >1. Demand clearly in a higher regime; last 5 demands = [3383,3624,3457,3817,4068], mean ~3669.8. I set L using recent_N=5 to reflect the recent lead-time average signal. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to anchor the OR backend to the current high-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std internally). This keeps service high given large in-transit stock but adapts orders to the faster recent lead time and sustained high demand, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Recent lead-time observations shortened (last 5 observed LT avg \u22481.6).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=10532; recent demand has been high (~3000-4000 per period). Historical conclude messages show lead-time recently shorter than promised (last 5 observed lead times = [1,1,2,2,2], avg=1.6) so I bias lead-time estimate toward recent observations. To protect service given very high recent demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (last 10 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding stale low-demand data. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand (reduce stockouts) while sigma_hat from recent data captures current volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=10532. Recent demand is much higher than early samples \u2014 recent periods (approx P22\u2013P41) show sustained high demand (~2,000\u20134,000 per period). Lead time history shows variability but multi-period evidence of shorter recent lead times (carry-over noted avg ~1.6 over last 5). To reflect the system's empirical lead-time evidence I let the backend calculate average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I focus on the most recent data to capture the sustained high-demand regime and rising means, so I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the latest 20 demand samples. This emphasizes current high demand and recent volatility so the OR engine will set a larger base-stock to meet service while the capped order cap controls order size and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=13073. Historical concludes show lead-time has shortened recently (last 5 observed lead times avg ~1.6) and demand has been in a sustained high regime across recent periods (~Periods 24-42). I set L using recent_N (N=5) to capture the shorter recent lead-time behavior. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 24\u201342) to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the sustained high-demand regime rather than early low-demand samples. These choices help the OR backend set a base stock that reflects the faster arrivals and much higher current demand, balancing service level (avoid large stockouts) against holding cost given available pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1444.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: demand has been at a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (multi-period high demands through Period 43). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 12997 \u2014 significant pipeline but arrivals have been irregular (recent concludes show a mix of 1\u20133 period lead times). To capture true lead-time behaviour I ask the backend to calculate L from observed concluded lead times. For demand I focus on the most recent sustained high-demand regime, using recent_N with N=20 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures recent mean/variance while limiting noise from early low-demand periods). This balances service (higher safety stock for the sustained high demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=13729. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times but recent window indicates shorter average (~1.6). Recent demand is high and has been elevated for many periods (last 5 demands: 3881,3997,4099,4417,4470; mean\u22484173). In-transit (~13729) covers ~3.3 of these recent periods. To reflect the recently shortened lead-time regime and very high recent demand, I use recent_N=5 for lead time, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the most recent demand and lead-time behavior while letting the backend compute the numeric averages/volatility. This balances service (capture high recent demand) against holding cost by relying on recent observed demand/lead-time rather than older low samples.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=11188. Historical concludes show variable lead times (many 3s early, some 1-2 recently) and a sustained demand regime shift to much higher demand earlier. Because lead time has varied, use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand remains in a higher regime vs initial samples, so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while letting the backend estimate L from observed concludes and compute matching caps.

Lead-time observations in recent concludes show shorter lead times (last 5 observed lead times avg \u22481.6). To match current regime I set lead time using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the shorter realized lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so forecast and uncertainty reflect the sustained high-demand regime (last 5 periods). These parameters will raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under current high demand while using recent volatility to balance service vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

To reflect the confirmed shorter recent lead times I estimate L using recent observations. To capture the current high-demand regime and recent variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the most relevant regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent history rather than the long-run mean.

To reflect shorter recent lead times while being responsive to very high recent demand, set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=5). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the sustained high regime (recent_N=5). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to cover the short recent lead-time regime and the current elevated demand while the large in-transit balance reduces risk of stockouts from prior orders.
