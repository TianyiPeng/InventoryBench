Risk assessment: evidence of longer/variable lead time and at least one delayed/lost shipment increases stockout risk if we blindly follow OR. Holding cost = profit, so overstock is as costly as understocking; however, given rising historical demand trend (107\u2192544) and inconsistent deliveries, it's prudent to add buffer to replace potential lost/delayed shipments and to cover a possible L\u22653.
