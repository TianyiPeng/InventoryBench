  "rationale": "Observations & lead-time: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised L=2 (use L+1=3 periods coverage). No concluded arrivals exist yet, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments.

Decision & justification: I accept the OR recommendation (581 units). Rationale: (1) Recent three-period demand is substantially higher and OR's capped policy already incorporates safety stock for the 3-period risk window, so ordering OR's quantity balances the need to cover rising demand while respecting the cap designed to limit excessive pipeline when variance is large. (2) With no confirmed lead-time deviations or lost shipments yet, deviating upward risks excessive holding cost; deviating downward risks stockouts given the clear upward trend. Therefore follow OR's capped recommendation to cover expected demand over the lead+review horizon while avoiding outsized over-ordering.",
