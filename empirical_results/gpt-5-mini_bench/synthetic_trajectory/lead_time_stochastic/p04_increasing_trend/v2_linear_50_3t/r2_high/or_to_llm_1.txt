Decision: place 71 units (follow OR). Reasoning: OR already encodes the high critical fractile from large profit vs holding cost and then caps to limit extreme swings when pipeline is empty; with zero pipeline and no evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift, the cap is a deliberate smoothing constraint to avoid over-ordering given parameter uncertainty. No concluded arrivals exist to justify increasing above OR's capped recommendation despite 3-period expected demand being ~149 units; raising the order now risks excessive holding cost if demand variance or lead-time/losses intervene. Therefore follow OR's capped order of 71 units this period. Rationale summary: (1) Recomputed OR calculations and confirmed 71 matches capped policy; (2) no evidence yet to override (no concluded arrivals or sustained demand change); (3) follow OR to balance stockout risk and hold cost under uncertainty.",

{
  "rationale": "History shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 12 (carry-over insight). Recent realized demands (Periods 44\u201348 = 181, 201, 144, 198, 207) imply a current single-period mean \u2248 186\u2013190 units. At decision time Period 49 we have on-hand=0 and in-transit=600. Requirement per guidance: ensure pipeline + on-hand covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand because current period demand occurs after ordering. 3 periods \xd7 190 \u2248 570 units. In-transit 600 > 570, so current pipeline is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods under the observed high-demand regime. Promised lead time =2 but actual lead time has been inconsistent (1\u20133) and some late/lost shipments have occurred; however enough concluded arrivals recently imply most in-transit likely to arrive. Holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19 so small overstock is tolerable, but ordering now would increase holding cost across remaining periods without materially increasing service. OR recommended 0; I agree and place 0 to avoid unnecessary holding given sufficient pipeline coverage. If multiple in-transit units fail to arrive in the next 1\u20132 periods, follow-up periods should reassess and place expedited orders then.",
