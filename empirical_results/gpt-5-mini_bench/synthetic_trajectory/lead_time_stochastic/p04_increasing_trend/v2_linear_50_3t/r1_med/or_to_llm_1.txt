Rationale: incoming 149 units should cover the next (L+1) periods' demand, so placing additional order increases holding cost without materially reducing expected stockouts. Monitor arrival in Period 4 conclude to confirm lead time; if arrivals fail to conclude, revise upward orders then.\nFinal strategy ties to OR: I override OR's small positive recommendation (14 \u2192 0) because pipeline already equals the OR-implied (L+1)-period target and holding cost penalizes excess inventory.",

Ordering would raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit per unit is $4; given adequate pipeline I avoid increasing inventory.

Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=708. Requirement: orders placed now would not arrive for 3 periods, so decision must ensure pipeline + on-hand covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Demand cover: 3 * 124.7 \u2248 374 units. Pipeline 708 >> 374, so we have ample supply arriving before we would be able to use any new order. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit, so unnecessary ordering increases holding cost and reduces objective.
