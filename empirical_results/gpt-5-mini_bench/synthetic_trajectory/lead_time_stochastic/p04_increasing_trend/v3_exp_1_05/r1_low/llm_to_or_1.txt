Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no conclude history to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all available samples (Periods 1-5) so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This is conservative given zero inventory and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=165. No concluded arrivals yet (Period_1 conclude: ordered=165 arrived=0), so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Use promised lead time to let OR backend apply its baseline forecast. Demand history mean ~115.6 (samples provided), pipeline 165 < expected (1+L)*mean, so default (promised L=2) with default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Recent concluded periods show orders placed in P1 (165) and P2 (160) have not arrived yet but are recorded as in-transit=325; no concluded arrivals so actual lead time not confirmed. Demand history across available samples shows mean ~115.6; no sustained changepoint (only two short recent demands). To avoid overreacting to missing but unconcluded shipments, keep lead time = promised (default) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample statistics. This balances service (covers (1+L) periods of expected demand) against holding cost while we wait for confirmed arrival evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=336 (orders placed in P1\u2013P3) and no arrivals have been concluded yet despite promised lead time=2. Historical demand samples (environment) show moderate volume; to be conservative about delayed/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3 (longer than promised) so the backend plans for a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (captures whole-sample demand with the chosen L). This raises safety stock to protect service while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed Period_1 (165 units), Period_2 (160 units), Period_3 (11 units) despite promised lead_time=2 \u2192 possible lost/delayed shipments; evidence spans 3 consecutive periods.

Daily Profit: $75.00, Daily Holding Cost: $101.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=101, in-transit=270. History shows some delayed arrivals (Period1 order arrived in P4 with lead_time=3; Period3 arrived with lead_time=1). Observed lead times = {3,1} so I use the average to let the OR engine adapt to actual variability. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (uses full sample set provided). This balances service level (using inferred longer average lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding, and leverages all samples since no sustained demand regime shift is confirmed.

Daily Profit: $95.00, Daily Holding Cost: $6.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: on-hand=6, in-transit=329. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4, W=1 for P3\u2192P4) and one overdue order (P2 ordered but not yet concluded) \u2014 evidence of delivery variability/delays but not a sustained single new lead-time. I set L using 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures delivery variability). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so demand forecast uses all historical samples (mean demand=115.6) scaled by (1+L); this balances service level against holding cost given current pipeline uncertainty and limited on-hand stock.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=419, recent demands [103,81,107,127,160]. History shows mixed actual lead times (observed P1->P4: 3 periods; P3->P4: 1 period) and prior delayed/lost arrivals. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures occasional 3-period delay). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand across the (1+L) review+lead horizon is computed from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) and the uncertain, occasionally-extended lead time. This approach ensures orders account for the longer observed delays while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period_1 order arrived in Period_4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: recent history shows confirmed longer lead time (observed lead_time=3 from concluded arrivals) and demand samples (Periods 1-5) averaging 115.6 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=321 (pending arrivals). Several earlier orders were delayed/lost before confirmations; therefore I explicitly set L=3 to reflect the confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine sizes orders to cover the longer pipeline. I use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat consistently from full history, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This keeps the policy conservative to protect against further delayed shipments while not overfitting short-term noise.

Daily Profit: $71.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand has risen sharply (concluded demands P5-P8 = 95,122,167,214) indicating a higher demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (multiple long-delayed arrivals observed earlier). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the backend base-stock up to meet elevated demand and account for the longer confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical concluded lead times show variability with multiple 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) and occasional 1-periods; average of observed lead times ~2.2 so I'll let backend use the observed average. Demand samples (103,81,107,127,160) are limited but show an upward trend; however I will keep mu_hat/sigma_hat as default formulas ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine computes demand across the review+lead period consistent with the inferred L. This balances higher service needs from delayed shipments (large in-transit, past delayed arrivals) against holding cost sensitivity (profit=holding so q=0.5), letting the backend's capped policy limit order size.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=483. History shows mixed lead times with several 3-period arrivals and some 1-periods; average observed lead time \u22482. Earlier periods showed delayed/missing arrivals but recent pattern averages to promised L=2. I therefore let the backend compute L by averaging observed lead times (captures mix of 1 and 3-day arrivals), and used default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples respectively. This balances service (accounts for longer 3-period deliveries via averaged L) vs holding cost while leveraging all historical demand samples.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent demand history shows high, variable demand (samples: 103,81,107,127,160) and recent concluded arrivals imply mixed lead times (observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,1], average 2.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=483 \u2014 pipeline large but several earlier orders were delayed/lost; using estimated lead time derived from observed leads (calculate) keeps backend aligned with realized behavior. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat default formulas so the OR engine uses the full-sample demand mean/variance scaled by (1+L) to smooth over variability and avoid overreacting to short spikes while respecting the confirmed average lead time. This balances service (profit=holding so equal weight) vs holding cost by relying on full-sample statistics rather than overfitting recent noisy periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: on-hand=20, in-transit=250. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 3 (orders from P1\u2192arrive P4, P4\u2192arrive P7, P9\u2192arrive P12). Demand has shifted up starting Period_7. I set L explicit=3 to match confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from underestimated pipeline delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 8\u201312 recent observations) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts) given the sustained higher demand and long lead time while keeping holding exposure explicit to the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand increased from 101 (Periods 1\u20136) to 184 (Periods 7\u201312) (+82%); lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=499. Historical concluded lead times (observed): 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2 \u2014 recent pattern shows multiple 3-period realizations and prior carry-over confirmed lead_time=3. Demand shifted up at Period_7 (Periods 7\u201313 avg higher). To reflect confirmed longer actual lead time while letting OR engine compute average from observed concludes, set L via "calculate". For demand, use recent regime (Periods 7\u201313, 7 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to capture the higher mean and recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the higher (L+1)-period demand and the recent elevated mean, reducing stockouts given many overdue/lost shipments while acknowledging holding cost via OR's q tradeoff.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_7 (avg ~184) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead times > promised (several 3-period observations). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline) so avoid overshooting but respect longer effective lead-time. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 3-period pattern). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 7\u201314 constitute the new regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 demands, and sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align reorder coverage with the confirmed higher-demand regime and longer lead time while the large in-transit stock limits aggressive ordering.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 decision: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_7 (avg ~187 over Periods 7\u201315) and multiple confirmed lead-time observations (many =3, some =1\u20132). On-hand=0, in-transit=697 (large pipeline). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 observations, ~2.1). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 7\u201315) to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime; this sets mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and focuses orders on current demand level. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching the higher recent demand while acknowledging observed lead-time variability and the substantial pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Recent demand elevated (Periods 11\u201316 average \u2248195); use recent data to capture the higher regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L) demand and volatility on the most recent elevated-demand regime and reduce stockout risk given long lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: observed on-hand=53, in-transit=484. Historical concludes show a persistent actual lead time of 3 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period_7 (mean ~184 for P7\u2013P12). To protect service given confirmed LT=3 and the elevated recent demand, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime (last 11 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 demands and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 11 demands; this biases orders toward meeting the higher observed demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock via its z* formula.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=701. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time \u22483 in recent periods (most observed arrivals are 3 periods). Demand regime shifted up around Period_7; recent demands (P13\u2013P18 = 215,202,158,195,195,250) reflect the higher regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average observed W). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (use the six most recent periods to capture the post-shift demand mean and volatility). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) while avoiding overstock from older low-demand data. No new carry-over insight to add.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: recent demand high and volatile (post-Period7 regime). Concluded arrivals consistently show 3-period actual lead time (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) so use calculated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=743 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals confirm L\u22483; there are no new multi-period lost-shipment signals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent regime (Periods 7\u201319) to capture higher mean/variance so OR base-stock will target service during the elevated-demand regime while avoiding excess stock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_21. On-hand=0, in-transit=743. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent actual lead time ~3 periods (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Demand regime shift at Period_7 (mean rose from ~101 to ~184) persists through latest periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times so backend uses the confirmed ~3-period mean. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the post-shift regime (Periods 7\u201320, N=14) so forecasts reflect the higher sustained demand; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high demand) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than older low-demand data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: recent demand is in the higher regime (Periods 7\u201321 avg \u2248 244 last 6 periods) and historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period actual lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=752 (covering multiple future periods) but past shipments were delayed/lost\u2014so explicitly set L=3 to match observed lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (uses last 6 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This raises target base-stock to reduce lost sales while capping orders via backend cap to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=975. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time \u2248 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Demand permanently shifted up starting Period 7 (higher mean sustained through Period 22). To capture true supply delay risk, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To reflect the new high-demand regime, compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (Periods 7\u201322, 16 samples) via recent_N so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This balances service for elevated demand while the large in-transit volume will be reconciled by the backend pipeline term.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24. On-hand=0, in-transit=743. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (multiple observations P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P9/P12 patterns), and several lost/delayed shipments early on. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 and recent periods (P13\u2013P23) show elevated demand (avg \u2248244 units). To protect service given confirmed LT=3 and higher recent demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 13\u201323) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine raises base stock appropriately while letting its cap constrain extreme orders.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_7 (avg ~184) and consistently observed lead_time=3 in concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P22\u2192P23). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=978 (large pipeline). I set L via calculate to let the backend use observed lead times average (reflects confirmed LT=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201324) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=18 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the sustained higher demand while acknowledging large in-transit stock to avoid excessive additional ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=978. Historical conclues show sustained higher demand regime since Period_7 (Periods 7\u201325 higher average) and multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). There is strong evidence actual lead time \u22483 and a sustained demand increase starting Period_7. I set L using calculate to let backend compute the average observed lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=19 to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201325 length=19), so the base-stock will target the elevated demand while accounting for recent variability and the longer observed lead time. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given long lead times and high demand) against holding cost by centering estimates on the confirmed new regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=978, recent demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period_7 (confirmed earlier). Many concluded arrivals historically show lead times around 3 but with variability; use aggregate observed lead-time average so backend infers current effective L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 20 samples from the higher-demand regime) to reflect elevated mean and volatility over the review+lead period. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory; using recent_N focuses forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to compute safety stock given its L estimate.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: recent demand is in a higher regime (Periods 7\u201327 showing substantially larger values; historical mean increase already recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=978 \u2014 large pipeline exists but many prior shipments experienced 3-period lead times. I therefore set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (~2.17) (captures confirmed 3-period behavior while accounting for occasional 1\u20132). For demand I choose 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (uses full sample history including the confirmed regime shift). sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead times and high pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=978. Historical concludes show actual lead times varying but averaging slightly >2 and demand has risen sharply and stabilized at a high level in recent periods. I choose L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period occurrences). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 19\u201328) because a sustained higher-demand regime is evident; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of these 10 recent demands, sigma_hat will use the same 10-sample volatility to reflect current variability. This keeps orders aligned to the recent high demand while letting the OR engine cap orders per its safety rule; large in-transit stock is noted but not assumed lost without new conclude evidence.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand is in a higher regime (since Period_7) with very large weekly volumes (recent demands ~200\u2013402, trending up). On-hand=0, in-transit=1175. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P22\u2192P23) so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect reality and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to reflect current variability. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while accounting for confirmed longer lead time and current pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=1175. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period_20 (demands 324\u2192457). Lead times have repeatedly observed 3-period deliveries (many concluded arrivals P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), so I set L explicitly to 3. To align the replenishment horizon with the recent high-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 11 periods (Period_20\u2013Period_30) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility consistent with current demand. This increases order coverage for the elevated demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability and mitigating risk from past lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_20: avg demand increased from 184 (Periods 7\u201312) to 350.2 (Periods 20\u201330) (+90%), sustained 11 periods; Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (multiple observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=1401. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 20 (avg \u2248350 units). To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3. Demand forecasting uses recent data from the post-change high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=11 to capture Periods 20\u201330 regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps the base stock responsive to the sustained higher mean/volatility while accounting for the longer 3-period delivery lag; current large in-transit should be treated as covering several periods but may include future arrivals with varied led times, so using recent regime estimates avoids underordering or excess holding.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent demand has risen substantially (recent periods 20\u201332 show much higher demands vs early history) but on-hand=0 and in-transit=1204 (healthy pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (multiple 3s, several 1s and 2s); average of observed lead times \u22482.08 so I let backend calculate L from observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine incorporate the computed L while respecting historical volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=1175. Recent conclude history shows lead_times shifting recently to 1 (arrivals: P31->P32=1, P32->P33=1 and prior mixed 1/2/3). I do NOT treat this as a long-term regime change (not 3+ periods of consistent different pattern until recently), but the last 3 observed lead times average to ~1 so I set L using recent_N to capture that short-term shift. Demand has been in the high regime since ~Period_20; to reflect current elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 13 periods (Periods 21\u201333) so the OR engine targets inventory for the current high-demand regime while L reflects the latest faster arrivals. This balances service level (cover high current demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=1175. Recent concluded arrivals show short lead times (orders P31->P32 and P32->P33 had lead_time=1), while historical data contains earlier 3-period delays. To balance risk of both outcomes and because very recent demand is much higher (~400\u2013520), I set L using recent lead-time evidence (recent_N). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (recent_N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This aims to size base stock for the (1+L) review+lead window reflecting current high demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 equals profit=$1.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. On-hand=0, in-transit=1175. Recent demand has been high and volatile; last 5 demands (Periods 31\u201335) = [402,507,518,492,591], avg \u2248502. Observed concluded lead times vary (1,1,2,3,...), recent arrivals show quicker 1-period deliveries but historic shipments include multiple 3-period events. To capture recent faster arrivals while still smoothing variability, I set L using a recent average of observed lead times (recent_N=6). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples (recent_N=5) so the OR backend builds base-stock for the current high-demand regime and captures recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat to meet current demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the full-history mean.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows actual lead time \u22483 periods (multiple concluded orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1590. Demand has a sustained high regime from Period_20\u201330 (avg\u2248350.2); current periods remain in that high regime. To ensure pipeline covers the longer realized lead time I set L=3 (explicit). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to target the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201330 length 11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect current elevated mean and volatility and avoid stockouts given large in-transit but delayed arrivals.

Period_38 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=1419. Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained shortening of actual lead time to 1 period (P31\u2192P32, P32\u2192P33, P36\u2192P37). Demand has been high and volatile since ~Period_28; to align orders with the recent high-demand regime I use recent-window forecasts. Set L by averaging the most recent confirmed lead times to capture the new 1-period behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 demand samples (Periods 28\u201337) so the base-stock reflects the elevated demand and recent volatility, balancing service level vs. holding given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 1 period (observed: P31\u2192P32, P32\u2192P33, P36\u2192P37)

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=1419. Recent concluded arrivals (P31\u2192P32, P32\u2192P33, P36\u2192P37, P37\u2192P38) confirm a shorter lead-time regime (1 period) versus earlier 3-period episodes. Demand has sharply increased since Period_31 (sustained high demands ~492\u2013614 over recent periods). To reflect confirmed shorter lead time while capturing the new high-demand regime, set L using calculate (average observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (periods 31\u201338 constitute an 8-period recent regime) so the OR engine targets safety stock appropriate for the elevated demand and reduced lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=1881. Recent concluded arrivals (P32, P33, P37) show lead_time = 1 consistently \u2014 use recent average of last 3 observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime starting at Period 31 (periods 31\u201339 demand samples: 402,507,518,492,591,549,576,614,648); use recent_N over these 9 most recent high-demand periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking despite holding cost parity with profit.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=1419. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent 1-period lead times since Period_31; pipeline is large relative to single-period lead. Demand has shifted up sharply starting Period_31 (sustained ~10 periods). I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers the observed short lead-time from concluded history. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to capture the new, higher demand regime (Periods 31\u201340) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the sustained increase while avoiding overweighting older, lower-demand data. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg increased from 350.2 (Periods 20\u201330) to 554.6 (Periods 31\u201340) (+58%)

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=1944. Recent confirmed regime: demand has been high since Period_31 (avg \u2248554.6) with recent 10-period mean \u2248589.9. Lead time has recently been observed as 1 period (multiple confirmations around Periods 31\u201340). To match recent high-demand regime and shorter actual lead time, I set L based on recent lead-time observations, and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 10 demand samples to capture the elevated mean and volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the new high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand remains at the elevated regime (Periods 31\u201342 avg >> earlier). Recent concluded arrivals show lead time has been mostly 1 period recently (multiple P31\u219232, P32\u219233, P36\u219237, P39\u219240) though one recent order (P41) has not yet concluded. On-hand=0, in-transit=1944 \u2014 substantial pipeline. To reflect the recent faster lead-time regime and high recent demand, I set L by averaging recent observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the post-Period_31 high regime). These parameters bias orders toward meeting high immediate demand while relying on large existing pipeline to limit excess holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: demand has been in a high regime since Period_31 with another recent uptick in Periods 41\u201343. On-hand=0, in-transit=1944 (covers multiple future periods but some past orders were delayed/lost historically). Recent concluded lead times show predominantly 1-period arrivals (multiple confirms) but earlier history includes 3-period delays; use calculated average lead time to let backend synthesize observed variability. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the newest higher-demand regime (Periods 41\u201343) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to meet the recent elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost = profit. This balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/changing lead times and a large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_41: avg increased from 554.6 (Periods 31\u201340) to 756.7 (Periods 41\u201343) (+36%), sustained 3 periods

Lead times have varied (observed 1\u20133); use a short recent average to reflect current behaviour. Set L via recent_N to capture recent lead-time pattern. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 periods) so the OR base-stock targets the current high-demand regime and balances stockouts vs holding cost given profit=holding.

On-hand=0, in-transit=2087 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals uncertain (no conclude in Period_46). Lead times have varied (observed 1 and 3 periods); use calculated average lead time from concluded history to reflect mixed evidence. Demand regime recently shifted upward (Periods 41+); use recent_N=7 (Periods 40\u201346) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime and keep safety stock aligned with recent volatility. This balances high stockouts cost (profit=holding) by basing base-stock on recent high mean and variance while relying on pipeline to cover much demand.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20133) and multiple past demand regime shifts up to very high recent demand; no clear new demand regime in last 3+ periods. To be conservative given volatile lead-time evidence, let backend compute an averaged effective lead time from observed concludes and use default demand stats (all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect full history and the backend's cap logic. This balances service vs. holding given large pipeline and equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Period 49 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=2740. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1 and 3 periods repeatedly) so I let backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate) to capture current realized mix. Demand has several sustained regime shifts but no new confirmed regime since Period_44; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances using empirical lead-time evidence while letting OR backend compute the base-stock from full-sample demand statistics, ensuring pipeline + on-hand targets cover (L+1) periods of demand given the large in-transit volume.

Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=2740. History shows variable actual lead times (mix of 1 and 3, occasional lost shipments) so I let the backend compute an average observed lead time (calculate) rather than trusting promised 2. I select default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages the full history for a stable forecast while the averaged L lets the OR engine size orders to cover the appropriate (1+L) periods. With large pipeline inventory (2740) this balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to recent noisy arrivals.
