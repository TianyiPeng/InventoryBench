  "rationale": "a) World/product: chips(Regular) is nonseasonal snack; recent history drives forecast. b) Demand regime: recent demands P46\u2013P49 = [968,957,1043,1097], average \u22481016 units/period, clearly above prior regime (~719). c) Lead time/missing orders: supplier promised L=2 but actual lead times have varied 1\u20133 in history; in-transit=3000 may arrive with mixed lead times (some prior large orders took 2\u20133). No concluded arrivals in current period to revise lead-time. d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=3000. Forecast shortfall for (L+1)=3 periods demand = 3\xd71016=3048 \u2192 short by ~48 units. e) Order logic: holding cost = profit so avoid large excess. Place a small replenishment to cover the ~48-unit shortfall while relying on in-transit bulk. Order rounded to 50 units.",
