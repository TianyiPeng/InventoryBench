Recent confirmed carry-overs show actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained higher demand regime (avg demand ~900\u20131100 in recent periods).

Ordering covers risk of stockout given volatile arrivals and lost-order history. Risk: if actual lead time shorter, extra inventory incurs holding cost $1/unit/period; profit per unit $4 remains attractive. Action: place a small corrective order of 100 units to bring pipeline+on-hand to ~4000, matching (L+1)-period demand coverage under confirmed lead time and recent demand regime.
