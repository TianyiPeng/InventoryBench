Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular): [103,81,107,127,160] show an upward trend but only 5 points and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes or a sustained regime shift. No shipments have concluded, so actual lead time is unknown. Use promised lead time (default) so backend uses promised L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are applied. This balances service level against holding cost without overfitting to a short apparent uptick or unconfirmed lead-time change.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=165 (order placed Period_1 not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 2 and there is no concluded arrival evidence to change it, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to reflect historical demand while allowing the OR engine to account for pipeline. This balances service level (profit>>holding cost) with moderate holding risk given current pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=325. Recent concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (orders remain missing/delayed), so actual lead time appears longer than promised; I conservatively set L explicit=3 to account for delayed shipments. Demand history shows moderate demand (recent realized demands: P1=118, P2=88; longer sample set available), so I'll use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales demand across (1+L) periods given the chosen L. This increases pipeline coverage to balance service level against low holding cost while accounting for overdue shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=481; three consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1-3) show ordered units but zero arrivals \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments beyond promised L=2. Demand series shows an upward shift in recent periods (last 3 demands: 107,127,160). To be conservative on lead time I set L explicit=3 to reflect additional delay risk. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the apparent recent demand increase; this focuses the (1+L)-period forecast on the newest regime and raises target base-stock to maintain service given delayed arrivals. Carry-over insight records the sustained missing arrivals pattern for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not arrived by Period_3 conclude (3 consecutive periods with zero arrivals) \u2014 possible lost or extended lead time.

Daily Profit: $1425.00, Daily Holding Cost: $246.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1179.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: recent concluded history shows mixed/extended lead times (Period 4 conclude: order from P1 arrived with lead_time=3, order from P3 arrived with lead_time=1). On-hand=246, in-transit=160; previous periods showed multiple delayed arrivals that partly resolved in Period 4. Given this evidence I let the backend infer an effective lead time from observed arrivals (method=calculate) rather than trusting the promised fixed value. For demand I use the default aggregate estimate (method=default) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) incorporating the backend-computed L; sigma_hat also uses the default aggregate volatility (method=default). This balances service level (accounting for observed longer lead times) versus holding cost by increasing the review+lead demand forecast only if the backend confirms longer L from the observed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1654.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: on-hand=151, in-transit=270. Historical demand (P1-5): [103,81,107,127,160], recent upward trend (last 3: 107,127,160). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1->P4 lead_time=3, P3->P4 lead_time=1) so use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile variability. Forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N=3 to capture the clear uptick in demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect service level given observed delays while keeping holding cost in check by limiting horizon to recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2289.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=29, in-transit=275. Recent demand rising (last 3 demand samples 107,127,160 \u2192 mean=131.33) and last realized demand was 122. Arrival history shows variable lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4); average observed lead time ~2. To capture the recent uptick in demand while letting the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, set L to 'calculate' (use avg observed), use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and keep sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility over the review+lead period. This balances higher service needs from rising demand against holding cost given sizeable in-transit stock.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=412. Historical concluded lead times: observed W={3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4)} \u2192 average=2. Recent orders (P5\u2013P7) have no concluded arrivals yet (possible delays) but not enough sustained evidence to change lead-time belief. Demand history samples mean=115.6 (Periods 1\u20135). Given observed lead times average equals promised (2), use calculated L to reflect observed data; use default demand/volatility aggregation to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a balanced service level vs holding cost given high profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4033.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand has risen (historical samples mean=115.6; recent concluded demands show peaks up to 214). Current inventory: on-hand=33, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Observed arrivals show inconsistent lead times (1 and 3 periods), so use calculated average lead time to reflect actual behavior. I choose L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times = 2). For demand forecast use 'default' so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture multi-period demand (stable sample mean across history). For volatility use 'default' so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). These settings balance service level (accounting for observed longer arrivals) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: observed arrivals with lead_times = {3,1,3,1} across concluded periods (4 observations); average observed lead_time = 2 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demand has risen sharply (last periods: 95,122,167,214,199) and pipeline shows 350 units in-transit but on-hand=0. Lead-time evidence from concluded periods shows variability {3,1,3,1} with average \u22482 \u2014 use observed average rather than promised. Set L by calculating average observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (last 5 demands) so the base-stock and caps reflect the new demand level while respecting observed lead-time variability and outstanding in-transit stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=593. Recent demand has risen (Periods 6-10 mean \u2248165.4). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals = {3,1,3,1,1}, average \u22481.8 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. To avoid overstating long-term volatility but capture recent higher demand, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods. Chosen methods: L calculated from observed lead times to reflect variable/shortening lead times; mu_hat recent_N(5) to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N(5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher recent demand) with holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: recent concludes show elevated demand since Period 7 (demands P7\u2013P11 = 167,214,199,125,189) and substantial in-transit (739) with on-hand 0. Past concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed = {3,1,3,1,1}, avg \u22481.8). I set L="calculate" so backend uses the observed average lead time rather than the promised 2, capturing lead-time variability and overdue/lost shipment risk. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 7\u201311) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 demands). Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=5) so sigma_hat reflects recent variance. These choices bias orders upward to cover the sustained demand increase while the calculated L captures actual arrival delays, balancing service level (profit per unit high) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand increased from 115.6 (Periods 1\u20135) to 178.8 (Periods 7\u201311) (+54.6%); confirmed over 5 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=215, in-transit=324. Historical concluded lead-times show mixed 1\u20133 periods with average \u22482; demand regime shift at Period 7 raised mean (Periods 7\u201311 = 5 samples). To reflect observed lead-time variability use L=calculate (average of observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 (focus on the confirmed higher-demand regime for Periods 7\u201311). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices align base-stock to the confirmed higher mean while accounting for realized lead-time behavior and limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=573. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with average ~2 periods and a confirmed demand regime shift upward beginning Period_7 (Periods 7\u201311 elevated). To reflect observed lead-time variability I set L via 'calculate' (use average observed lead times). To capture the higher recent demand, I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (uses the 5-period elevated regime for (1+L)\xd7mean). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward the new higher-demand regime while letting the backend incorporate the observed lead-time average; keeping sigma matched to recent volatility balances service level against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent demand regime elevated (Periods 7\u201314 mean \u2248179\u2013189) and sustained over many periods; use recent demand to reflect the higher level. Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3}, average \u22482.125 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=640 (pipeline substantial), so set L to inferred average to have backend account for longer/mixed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5 demands (Periods 10\u201314) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=777. Historical conclues show variable lead times (observed {3,1,3,1,2,3,1,3} averaging ~2) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 7 (recent avg demand ~195 over Periods 11\u201315). Given large pipeline and confirmed higher demand, set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses realized lead-time history. For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean (Periods 11\u201315 mean=195.4) and to keep safety modest given pipeline. For volatility use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices align mu_hat/sigma_hat to the current higher-demand regime while L=calculate ensures the OR engine accounts for realized lead-time behavior; with large in-transit stock this avoids over-ordering while preserving service against higher demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: recent history shows confirmed demand regime shift (Periods 7\u201311 avg ~178.8) and high lead-time variability (observed lead_times include 1\u20133; average ~2). On-hand=54 + in-transit=528 => pipeline=582 units, which currently covers several periods of elevated demand but some in-transit shipments showed multi-period delays. I set L using "calculate" to let backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variability/extended LT). For demand I use "recent_N" with N=5 to base mu_hat on the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 7\u201311). For sigma_hat I also use "recent_N" with N=5 to reflect volatility in the most recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service under the sustained higher demand while letting the backend incorporate the inferred average lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3633.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_7 (confirmed earlier: avg increased +54.6% over Periods 7\u201311) and recent periods (P12\u2013P17) continue to show elevated demand (~190s). Lead times remain variable with multiple observed 3-period arrivals since early periods; use observed lead time average rather than promised to capture variability. Decisions: set L by 'calculate' to use average of all observed lead times (captures realized variability and late arrivals). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 to base the (1+L)\xd7forecast on the full confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201317). Keep sigma_hat as 'default' (use population std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) because variance shows no new sustained change. This balances service level (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given variable lead times) against holding cost by relying on backend cap and default sigma to prevent excessive safety stock.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent demand is in a higher regime (sustained increase since Period_7). On-hand=0, in-transit=765 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times vary (1,2,3) so I use calculate for L to let backend average empirical lead times. To capture the confirmed higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=12 (Periods 7\u201318) so the forecast and volatility reflect the new, sustained higher-demand regime while the backend will size orders against the computed lead time and pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=807. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead_times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3,3) \u2014 average \u22482.36, so I use calculated average lead time. Demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime since Period 7 (confirmed earlier through Period 11); recent demand (Periods 15\u201319 = 158,195,195,250,215) better reflects current mean/volatility. To align the OR base-stock with current demand while accounting for lead-time variability and past delayed/lost shipments, I set L=calculate (use observed avg), mu_hat on recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher mean, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This raises target pipeline to reduce stockouts given variable/extended lead times while controlling holding cost via recent volatility estimate.

To capture current lead-time behavior I let the backend calculate average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I focus on the most recent regime: use the last 5 demand samples (Periods 17\u201321) to set forecast (captures the higher recent mean). Volatility also set from the same recent 5 to reflect elevated variability. These choices keep service high for the sustained higher-demand regime while preventing excessive inventory by using recent data and the backend cap.

Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=1096 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show high variability but average \u22482; recent demand has risen sharply since Period_18 (demands: 250,215,324,283,322). To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the calculated average lead time (lets backend use all observed lead times). For demand I use a recent_N regime to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 5 periods: P18\u2013P22). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This keeps orders responsive to observed higher demand while the large in-transit inventory reduces immediate order urgency and mitigates risk from occasional lost/delayed shipments.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=887. Recent concluded arrivals show average observed lead time ~2 (matches promised=2). Demand has risen sharply in recent periods (Periods 19\u201323: 215,324,283,322,329). To capture the new high-demand regime and ensure the OR base-stock covers the review+lead period, set L by calculating observed average lead time, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the latest demand mean and volatility over the last 5 periods. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while the large in-transit position limits immediate overordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg increased from 178.8 (Periods 7\u201311) to 294.6 (Periods 19\u201323) (+64.8%)

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 25 context: recent demand has been in a higher regime (Period 19\u201323 avg ~294.6/day per carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=1241 (large pipeline). Observed lead-times have varied (1\u20133); to be robust I let backend 'calculate' average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I target the most recent confirmed high-demand regime using recent_N (N=5 => Periods 19\u201323) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to capture current volatility. This preserves service in a sustained high-demand regime while relying on the backend cap to limit order size given large pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=1161. Recent concluded history shows high-demand regime since Period_19 (demands P19\u2013P25 = 215,324,283,322,329,286,325) \u2014 sustained elevated demand. Observed lead times have varied but long-run average \u22482; use backend 'calculate' to let it estimate actual L from observed concludes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent demand regime (Period_19 onward). I choose N=7 (Period_19\u2013Period_25) because the regime length is 7; this focuses the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and volatility on the confirmed high-demand regime. These parameters prioritize meeting high current demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk; using recent data raises the base stock to balance profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent demand remains at the elevated regime that began at Period 19 (periods 19\u201326 demands: 215,324,283,322,329,286,325,351 \u2014 sustained high demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=1233 (large pipeline). No new concluded arrivals in the last conclude (Period 26), but past history shows variable lead times; however no sustained lead-time change since promised L=2. I set L=default to use the promised lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 (the confirmed high-demand regime from Period 19 through Period 26) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the sustained higher demand while relying on the pipeline to absorb lead-time noise and avoids overreacting to single-period arrival variability.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: recent demand is very high (Periods 19\u201327 show a sustained elevated regime vs earlier periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1233 (large pipeline). Past concluded lead-time observations average ~2 periods. To reflect confirmed higher-demand regime and recent lead-time evidence, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the current high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201327). This keeps OR base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while leveraging the pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=1234. Recent demand has been high (Periods 24\u201328 = 286,325,351,379,394). Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times; using observed lead times (16 observations) average \u22482.25. To capture the recent high-demand regime and current pipeline, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times average), set mu_hat from the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current elevated demand ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples will be computed by backend), and set sigma_hat from the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat for recent surge) against holding cost while acknowledging longer/variable actual lead times and large in-transit volume.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=1420. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (Periods 19\u201329: many demands 286\u2013402; last 5 demands = {325,351,379,394,402}, mean=370.2). Lead-time history shows variability but prior analysis confirms average \u22482. I choose L by calculating the average observed lead times so backend uses empirical lead-time; for demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting very high recent demand while acknowledging substantial pipeline (1420) to avoid over-ordering given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=1395. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 19 (periods 19\u201330: strong, volatile demand). Lead times observed historically are variable but average roughly ~2.3; multiple concluded arrivals confirm intermittent 1\u20133 period leads. I select L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability). For demand I use 'recent_N' with N=12 (use the last 12 periods in the current high-demand regime, Periods 19\u201330) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean across the review+lead period. sigma_hat set to 'default' so backend scales variability using all samples adjusted for chosen L. These choices balance the need to cover the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given observed lead-time variability and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32. Recent demand is much higher than early periods (recent 5-period avg ~406.8 vs long-run ~294.6); on-hand=0, in-transit=1582 (large pipeline). Observed lead-times have varied historically but recent evidence and carry-over average ~2; promised L=2 is reasonable. To capture the new high-demand regime and avoid stockouts while the large pipeline clears, I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L) by the most recent mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders to meet elevated demand while the OR engine enforces cap and service-level tradeoff given profit/holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=1395. Historical concluded lead-times average \u22482.17 periods (variable 1\u20133); use calculate to let backend use observed average. Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (last 5 concluded demands: 394,402,457,402,507; mean=432.4) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current high mean and volatility. With L\u22482.17, (1+L)*mean_recent \u22481371 \u2014 in-transit 1395 roughly covers the review+lead demand, so policy will avoid over-ordering while preserving service level given high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Observed lead times have varied historically; use calculated average from concluded arrivals to reflect actual behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of this elevated demand while limiting holding cost exposure given large in-transit inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=1844; recent realized demand has moved to a much higher regime (Periods 29\u201334: 402,457,402,507,518,492). Lead times have varied historically (1\u20133), so use observed-average lead time. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). Use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces risk of immediate stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg increased from 294.6 (Periods 19\u201323) to 463.0 (Periods 29\u201334) (+57.2%); confirmed over 6 periods (Periods 29\u201334).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=1847. Historical concluded lead_times show variability but average ~2 (observed {3,1,3,1,...}); recent demand is in the high regime (Periods 29\u201334 regime avg ~463). To balance service vs holding cost, set lead time to calculated average (use observed lead_time data), and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (use recent_N=6 to capture Periods 29\u201334). This yields mu_hat and sigma_hat anchored to the current high-demand regime while the OR backend applies its base-stock formula and cap.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. On-hand=0, in-transit=1894. Historical concluded lead times remain variable (1\u20133); average observed lead time \u22482. Recent demand remains in the high regime (Periods 33\u201337: 518, 492, 591, 549, 576). To capture current lead-time evidence use calculated average lead time; to reflect the recent high-demand regime use recent_N (last 5 periods) for both demand mean and volatility so the backend sizes base stock for the current high-demand regime while accounting for pipeline inventory. This balances service level (high profit) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=2094. Recent concluded lead-times show variability but average \u22482 (use observed average). Demand has been in the high regime since Period 29\u201335 (sustained uplift); use recent data to capture current high demand. Set L by averaging observed lead-times to reflect realized variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to target current high-demand regime and recent volatility, keeping safety stock responsive while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: recent demand is in a higher regime (Periods 35\u201339 demands = 591,549,576,614,648) versus prior regime. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1976 (large pipeline). Lead times remain variable but recent history supports an average ~2; use calculated L to capture observed variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to anchor forecasts to the new high-demand regime (last 5 periods) so base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the new regime) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: avg increased from 463.0 (Periods 29\u201334) to 597.6 (Periods 35\u201339) (+29.0%)

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41. On-hand=0, in-transit=2168. Recent history shows sustained high-demand regime (Periods 35\u201339 avg ~597.6 units) and variable lead times but average ~2. To cover the current high-demand regime and the review+lead period, set L via calculate (use observed lead-time history average), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent confirmed high-demand regime. This prioritizes service (reduce stockouts) while letting OR backend apply cap and service-level math given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=2300. Recent concluded history shows high, sustained demand regime increases with most recent confirmed regime (Periods 35\u201339) averaging ~597.6; observed lead times average ~2 (consistent with promised). To match the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and set demand/volatility to recent_N based on the most recent confirmed regime (N=5). This provides the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast centered on the latest sustained demand level.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=2300. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) but average ~2 periods; no new sustained demand regime change in the last 3+ periods (only two high-demand periods P41\u201342). To reflect observed lead-time variability while remaining conservative I set L to 'calculate' (use average observed lead time \u22482). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history; with large pipeline (2300) this avoids over-ordering against short-lived spikes and lets the backend cap orders using its cap formula. This balances service level (acknowledging longer/mixed lead times) against holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5206.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 start. Recent demand is very high (Periods 39\u201343 demands = 648,649,755,741,774) and prior carry-over notes show multiple upward regime shifts; on-hand = 0, in-transit = 2026 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have varied (1\u20133); I use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to target the current high-demand regime (use last 5 periods to forecast the (1+L)-period demand). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the OR engine to raise the base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit reduces the order amount through the pipeline adjustment.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=2563. Recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 40\u201344 = 649,755,741,774,845) confirming a high-demand regime beginning ~Period 40. Lead-time history is variable but recent concluded observations average ~2 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history average (captures variable recent arrivals). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (last 5 periods), so base-stock reflects current elevated demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples; this also helps the capped order cap remain sensible given large pipeline. This balances service (high profit) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=2857, recent demand has been in a high regime (sustained increases through Periods 29\u201345 with latest demands 591\u2192...\u2192919). Lead times have been variable but average ~2 (observed mix of 1\u20133). To capture current high-demand regime while letting backend infer confirmed lead time from concluded arrivals, I set L via calculate (use observed average). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N on the most recent 11 demand observations to reflect the elevated regime and recent variability so base-stock will scale to current demand and the cap limits extreme orders given pipeline inventory. This balances high service-level need vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Lead times remain variable (1\u20133) with overall average \u22482; use calculated average lead time to let backend quantify actual observed mean. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demand samples) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit balance.

This balances higher target stock for elevated demand while using recent volatility and measured lead time to avoid excessive holding given holding cost=$1.
