Evidence of variable/longer-than-promised lead times exists, but it's not yet a sustained 3+ period confirmation, so I will not firmly rebase the OR's assumed L=2. Step 2 \u2014 Inventory vs. demand: On-hand=180, in-transit=124 \u2192 pipeline total = 304 units. Recent realized demands (concludes) are ~77\u201386 units/period; separate historical sample set shows similar single-period means (~84).

If actual L=3 we need 4 periods \u2192 320 units, we are short by ~16 units. Step 3 \u2014 Costs and risk: Profit = holding cost, so over-ordering yields no margin advantage; holding cost equals profit so extra stock provides no expected value unless avoiding large stockouts.

Using L=3 means plan should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Recent realized demand (Periods 46\u201349: 102, 91, 124, 80) averages \u224899 units/period \u2192 4-period demand \u2248396. Pipeline (449) > required cover (\u2248396), so no additional order is warranted. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), so excess inventory is costly; avoid increasing inventory while pipeline already suffices. Therefore follow a no-order action (0 units) to prevent unnecessary holding costs and because outstanding pipeline already covers expected demand through the lead time plus current period.",
