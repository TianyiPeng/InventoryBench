There is lead-time uncertainty (observed variability and a large outstanding in-transit order) and holding cost ($1/unit/period) makes excess inventory costly relative to profit ($4).

To balance stockout risk vs holding cost, I scale OR's ~71 recommendation down to a conservative incremental order of 40 units to top up the pipeline while avoiding excessive holding.

{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed in carry-over: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Promised L=2 but reality is L=3, so planning horizon = L+1 = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=712 units. Even using a conservative single-period demand estimate (~115 units) the 4-period demand = ~460 units, which is well covered by the 712 units already in transit. Ordering additional units would increase holding cost without reducing stockouts. OR recommended 0 units (capped policy); given the large pipeline that exceeds the 4-period demand requirement and positive holding cost, I follow OR and place no order.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 confirmed lead time = 3 (planning horizon 4 periods) and in-transit 712 comfortably exceeds estimated 4-period demand (~460), so ordering would incur unnecessary holding cost.",
