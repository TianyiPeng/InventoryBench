No concluded arrivals yet that contradict promised lead time, so do NOT declare lost shipment or lead-time shift. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=145. Historical mean single-period demand = (130+122+106+108+71)/5 = 107.4 units.

I will order 177 units to bring pipeline+order up to cover the 3-period expected demand, accepting no extra safety stock (z*=0 implied by equal profit and holding cost).

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows multiple arrivals with lead_time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) so actual lead time is confirmed at 3 periods (longer than supplier-promised 2). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 485 units. With observed L=3, we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand from pipeline+on-hand; 485 units already represent a very large pipeline relative to recent demand. Demand outlook: historical sample mean from provided training samples = 107.4 units/period and recent realized demands (Periods 40\u201349: mostly 50\u2013108, trending lower than earlier peaks) do not indicate an imminent surge. Risk tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1 equals holding cost per unit-period = $1, so over-ordering incurs high carrying-cost risk with little incremental reward. OR recommended 0 (it used promised L and pipeline in its cap); given confirmed longer lead time and very large in-transit position, placing additional order would only increase expected holding cost and risk of excess ending inventory. Final decision: place 0 units now to avoid increasing holding costs; rely on in-transit inventory to satisfy upcoming demand and observe which in-transit shipments actually conclude before ordering again.",
