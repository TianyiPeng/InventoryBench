Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows highly variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) and persistent overdue/in-transit orders (history notes P2:100, P6:120 and current In-transit=444). That means many units are already en route with uncertain ETAs; some will still arrive quickly (1 period) and others later (3+), and some may be lost, but we cannot assume fast certainty. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, In-transit=444. Recent realized demand (Periods 38\u201349) has been in the lower regime (~60\u2013100 per period), while earlier higher-demand regimes occurred much earlier and are recorded as carry-over insights. A conservative coverage target (L+1 = 3 periods) at a conservative recent demand estimate of 100/unit yields ~300 units; in-transit 444 exceeds this by a wide margin. OR recommended 27 units (uses promised L and historical samples) but does not see the large pipeline or lost/late shipments. Decision: Do not place any new order this period (order = 0). Rationale for 0: avoid increasing ending inventory and holding costs given large pipeline (>3-period coverage) and lead-time uncertainty; additional ordering risks extra holding cost if overdue shipments arrive. If many in-transit units are later confirmed lost over multiple future conclude messages, we will resume ordering then. Thus I override OR's suggestion (27) and place 0 units now.",
