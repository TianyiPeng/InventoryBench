Inventory status: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 740 units (these will arrive across upcoming periods). Demand outlook: carry-over insight from Period 43 indicates we are in the lower-demand regime (Periods 36\u201342 avg \u224885 units/period). With L=3, needed coverage is (L+1)=4 periods; expected demand \u224885\xd74 = 340 units over that horizon. Decision logic vs OR: OR recommends 0 units; OR uses promised lead time and historical data and cannot see lost shipments or the confirmed lead-time. Given confirmed lead time=3 and a very large in-transit of 740 (>2\xd7 the 4-period expected demand), placing any order risks substantial holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period equals profit). Thus do not order now. Plan: order 0 to avoid further holding cost; monitor actual arrivals in conclude messages and only reorder once in-transit + on-hand fall close to (L+1)\xd7expected_period_demand (~340).",
