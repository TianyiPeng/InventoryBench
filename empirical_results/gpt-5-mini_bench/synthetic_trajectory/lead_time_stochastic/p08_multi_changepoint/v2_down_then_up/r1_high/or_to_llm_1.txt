{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows supplier lead_time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, and later patterns). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 496 units (these are undelivered orders likely arriving with the 3-period lead time). Demand outlook: recent demand (Periods 45\u201349 = 113,125,117,120,120) averages \u2248119 units/period. Planning target: with actual L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand after ordering; 4\xd7119 \u2248 476 units. In-transit 496 \u2273 476, so pipeline already adequate to cover the next (L+1) periods. Cost tradeoff: profit = $19/unit vs holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 excess inventory reduces objective via holding cost without increasing near-term sales. OR recommended 0; given evidence of 3-period lead time and ample pipeline, I follow the OR recommendation and place no new order to avoid unnecessary holding costs and potential overstocking.
