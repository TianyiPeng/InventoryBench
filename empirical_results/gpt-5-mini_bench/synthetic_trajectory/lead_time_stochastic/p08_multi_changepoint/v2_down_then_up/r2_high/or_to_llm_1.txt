Promised L=2 but reality is L\u22483 frequently, so plan using L=3. Inventory & demand outlook: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 551. Recent periods (P36\u2013P49) show a sustained higher-demand regime (~130\u2013140 units/period) versus the original historical mean (~93.8). Use recent regime: estimate single-period demand \u2248140. Order sizing logic: With inferred L=3, we need coverage for (L+1)=4 periods. Required coverage = 4 \xd7 140 = 560 units. Current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 0 + 551 = 551, leaving a shortfall \u2248 9 units. Costs tradeoff: profit $19 >> holding $1 so small additional safety is cheap; avoid stockout given long/irregular lead times.
