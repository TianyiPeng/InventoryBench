Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time: Concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead time (orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P41\u2192P44, P42\u2192P45). I therefore treat actual L=3 (so must cover L+1=4 future periods when ordering).\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand outlook: Since Period 36 demand has shifted up, I computed the recent average demand over Periods 36\u201349 = 1653/14 \u2248 118 units/period. Using this sustained higher regime is appropriate given multi-period consistency.\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory reconciliation: Required pipeline to cover (L+1) periods = 4 \xd7 118 \u2248 472 units. Current available pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) = 518 + 0 = 518 units, which exceeds the 472 target by ~46 units.\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommended 0 (it uses promised L=2 and historical data). Given actual L=3 and the confirmed higher demand, we would order only if pipeline < required 472. Pipeline is sufficient, so no order now. This avoids extra holding cost while preserving service level.\nFinal decision: order 0 units for chips(Regular).",
