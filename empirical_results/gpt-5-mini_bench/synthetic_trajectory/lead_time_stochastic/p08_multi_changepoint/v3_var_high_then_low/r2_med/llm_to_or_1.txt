  Mean: 96.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start: no on-hand or in-transit inventory, no concluded arrivals or observed lead-times. Demand history (5 samples) available; no evidence of regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service vs holding cost given lack of signals and avoids overreacting to noise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: recent observed demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean ~96.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (order placed Period 1); no arrivals have concluded yet\u2014consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrival expected to conclude in Period_3). I use default lead time (promised=2) because no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a forecast that balances service level against holding cost while accounting for the 2-period lead time and the current in-transit pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=268. Two recent conclude messages show no arrivals yet for prior orders, but this is only 2 periods of delay\u2014insufficient to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population statistics to let the OR engine compute base stock: set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service vs holding cost while we await conclusive arrival evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (orders from P1-P3). No concluded arrivals in history, so cannot confirm actual lead time change; treat lead time as promised. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Demand history (all samples mean=96.8) used with default mu_hat => (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) while avoiding explicit overcorrection for delayed but not-yet-confirmed lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Period 1-3 (total 327 units) have not arrived by promised lead time\u2014possible prolonged delay or losses.

Daily Profit: $288.00, Daily Holding Cost: $119.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: observed arrivals show variable lead times (order P1 arrived in P4 => lead_time=3; order P3 arrived in P4 => lead_time=1) and one earlier shipment (P2) remains missing\u2014pipeline shows on-hand=119, in-transit=136 (total 255) which covers several periods of demand. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the demonstrated variability instead of blindly using the promised value). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast given limited and mixed recent signals; this balances service vs holding given the elevated in-transit inventory and uncertain lead-time behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $466.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: on-hand=2, in-transit=265, recent demands show variability. Concluded arrivals reveal observed lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); one order (from P2) remains unarrived -> evidence of lead-time variability/delays. I choose L = calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures realized variability). For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and limited on-hand inventory.

Daily Profit: $8.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical demand samples mean=96.8 (samples:71,120,95,116,82). Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (P1\u2192P4:3 periods; P3\u2192P4:1 period) so average observed lead time \u22482. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. With L\u22482, default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all \u2248 3\xd796.8 to capture demand over review+lead period; default sigma_hat to scale historical std by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (accounts for observed longer delays and current large in-transit) against holding cost by using demand history and observed lead-time average. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments now since in-transit is large but lead time variability noted.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=417. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4); average observed lead time = 2, so use calculated L to reflect recent evidence. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving a balanced base-stock given profit/holding tradeoff and accounting for the 1-period decision-arrival delay and existing in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1} from concluded messages) averaging ~2, and demand history (Periods 1-5 samples) has mean 96.8. Current on-hand=28 + in-transit=278 provides substantial pipeline but earlier delays occurred; however recent evidence does not show a sustained lead-time shift. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast I choose 'default' (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) since no sustained demand regime change is detected. Volatility uses 'default' as well (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings balance service level (capture observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~96.8. Observed concluded lead times = [3,1,3,1,1] (5 observations) => avg ~1.8 periods. Several earlier orders were delayed but in-transit volume (396) is large. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized behavior (method: calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given high in-transit and confirmed shorter-than-promised average lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as ~1.8 periods (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,1,1 over Periods 4-9 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: demand history shows stable ~100 units/period (samples: 71,120,95,116,82,117,62,123,122,109,111) and recent concluded arrivals indicate variable actual lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,1,1 \u2192 average ~1.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=414 (covers multi-period demand). I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed variability vs promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility I use 'default' (backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples) to leverage full sample set given no clear recent demand regime shift. This balances service level (capturing longer observed lead time) against holding cost, while relying on the capped ordering rule to limit over-ordering from in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=414. Recent concluded lead times (observed arrivals) show variability [3,1,3,1,1] \u2192 use average lead time. Demand has shifted upward vs initial five-sample history; recent 5-period demand (Periods 7-11 = 123,122,109,111,96) better represents current regime. Set L by averaging observed lead times to capture realized delivery behavior. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current higher-demand regime, improving service while controlling holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision: on-hand=44, in-transit=275. Historical concluded lead times observed = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2] (avg=2.0). Recent demand samples (5): [71,120,95,116,82], mean=96.8. Promised lead time=2; observed average equals 2. To cover review+lead demand and let OR backend compute safety stock per profit/holding tradeoff, I set L by calculating the average observed lead time, and use default demand/volatility aggregation across all samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full-sample mean and variability scaled by (1+L). This balances service against holding cost given moderate in-transit inventory (275) and current on-hand (44).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14. On-hand=0, in-transit=348. Historical concluded arrivals imply observed lead_times = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2] (avg = 2.0). This aligns with the promised L=2, so use calculate to let backend set L from observed data. Demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) have mean=96.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) provides a stable forecast that balances service level and holding cost given the recovered/consistent lead-time pattern and current sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=386. Historical concluded lead times: [3,1,3,1,1,3,2] \u2192 average \u22482.0, indicating actual lead time \u2248 promised 2. Use calculated L to capture observed lead-time behavior. Demand samples mean \u224896.8; using default mu/sigma lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples. With in-transit (386) > default target ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248290), no aggressive replenishment needed now. This choice accounts for earlier missing shipments by relying on observed lead-time average rather than the promise, and avoids over-ordering while preserving service given current pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=381. Historical concluded lead-times (flattened) = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3]; recent 5 observed lead-times average = 2.0. I set L using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent empirical lead-time (~2) rather than the promised 2, so pipeline coverage ((1+L) periods) matches observed delays. Demand historical samples mean=96.8; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a simple robust forecast and volatility estimate that balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=15, in-transit=320. Recent concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals (orders: P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16) indicating lead time has settled at ~3. Use recent_N for L to reflect this recent regime. Demand historical samples (Period_1..5) yield mean ~96.8; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L) so the OR backend computes a base-stock that accounts for the longer observed lead time and balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. This addresses past missing shipments by increasing review+lead coverage based on observed lead-time regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P9->P12 lead_time=3; P12->P15 lead_time=3; P13->P16 lead_time=3).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=365. Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained lead-time=3 signal (multiple P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17 observations). To avoid stockouts given visible 3-period transit, set L explicit=3. Demand has been variable but recently higher; use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (focus on last 6 periods) so the OR backend sizes base_stock from recent mean/volatility. This increases safety stock to protect service level under confirmed longer lead time while keeping holding cost sensitivity via recent volatility estimate.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand (Periods 14-18) averages ~106 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=464 (multiple past late arrivals; several recent arrivals show 3-period lead times). Many concluded arrivals in Periods 15-17 indicate sustained 3-period lead time. To protect service while avoiding excess holding, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (use confirmed recent pattern) so the backend sizes the review+lead demand window appropriately. I use a recent_N=5 demand estimate (captures the last 5 periods including the P17 spike) for mu_hat to reflect current demand level, and default sigma_hat so variability is estimated from full sample history.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=464, recent demand has averaged ~100/unit (samples: 71,120,95,116,82). Multiple concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (several P->P+3 observations), so actual lead time appears higher than promised=2. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand across (1+L) periods is scaled from full-sample mean/std. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time and large pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent demand elevated (Periods 16-20: 58,151,99,106,126; recent mean ~108). On-hand=0, in-transit=464 (covering multiple outstanding orders; several past orders were delayed but recent conclues show consistent 3-period arrivals). Observed concluded lead_times (10 samples) average ~2.3 but last three concluded lead_times are all 3 \u2192 I treat effective lead time as 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201320 mean ~108; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean computed by backend). For uncertainty I use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat so the OR engine uses recent volatility rather than older quiet periods. These choices prioritize service (profit margin $4 vs holding $1) while accounting for longer lead time and recent demand uplift.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times frequently =3 (multiple P1->P4, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16), so use calculated average lead time rather than the promised 2. Demand history (Periods 1-5 sample set) shows no sustained regime shift; use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances higher effective pipeline needs from longer lead times while avoiding overreacting to short-term variability. On-hand=0 and large in-transit (491) are consistent with delayed arrivals; calculated L will let backend size orders to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: recent demand has been ~100 units/period (Periods 18-22: 99,106,126,103,100). On-hand=0, in-transit=491 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16 observations). Given that confirmed LT=3, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=5 for demand forecast to capture the current ~100-unit regime (mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of last 5). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align target base-stock to current demand while recognizing the longer LT and the large in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3 across Periods 4,8,12,15,16,17). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine plans over the correct pipeline horizon. Demand level and variability remain in the historical range with no new sustained regime shift, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This increases pipeline coverage and reduces stockouts given delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine balance service vs. holding cost.

No new sustained regime change since prior confirmations of LT=3 around Periods 12-17, so retain a data-driven average. I set L=calculate (use average observed lead time) so the OR backend accounts for longer-than-promised deliveries. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, balancing service level with holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Lead-time history shows mixed 1\u20133 periods with recent clustering of 3s; I use recent_N (N=5) for L to capture the current ~3-period regime (avg of last 5 observed lead times \u22482.8). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the most recent regime and scales with (1+L); sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture longer recent lead times) while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window rather than all-time averages.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. Historical concluded lead_times (from conclude messages) = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,1,2], avg\u22482.09 \u2192 use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability and occasional 3-period delays. Demand samples mean = mean of [71,120,95,116,82]=96.8. I choose L by calculate to capture realized lead-time pattern; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std, balancing service level against holding cost given frequent multi-period delays. This approach accounts for the large in-transit volume (464) and observed prolonged delays without overfitting short recent fluctuations.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 57,83,143,83,121) averages 97.4 over last 5 periods with moderate variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=464 \u2014 pipeline is ample versus a 4-period (L+1) coverage if lead time is 3. Historical conclude messages (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) confirm actual lead time = 3 most consistently, so I use explicit L=3 to avoid under-ordering given repeated 3-period arrivals. mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to capture the latest regime (N=5 chosen because the most recent apparent regime length is 5 periods). This yields (1+L)\xd7recent_mean forecast that the OR backend will convert to base stock; with L=3 this keeps service high while avoiding excessive extra safety stock because in-transit already exceeds the 4-period demand estimate.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. Historical concluded messages (Periods 9->12,12->15,13->16) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. Several past shipments were delayed/lost, so I set L explicitly to 3 to align forecast horizon with observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, preserving statistical grounding while accounting for longer lead time and balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. Recent demand (Periods 25-29) is elevated and more variable vs. the earliest samples; shipments have shown variable lead-times historically (1-3). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history (captures mix of 1-3). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent demand) to react to the higher recent mean. For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service given large in-transit but recent high demand while keeping sigma responsive to recent variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical conclude messages (Periods 12-17 and earlier) show consistent lead_time=3 in multiple confirmed arrivals (e.g., P9->P12, P13->P16, P12->P15). I therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid underordering. Demand has clearly increased in recent periods (Periods 24-30: 83,143,83,121,107,156,150 \u2014 recent mean \u2248117), so I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime. I also use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices increase the target pipeline (1+L periods) to cover higher recent demand while the longer L accounts for delayed arrivals; this balances service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=0, in-transit=534. Historical concluded lead-times include multiple consistent 3-period observations (Periods 9->12,12->15,13->16,14->17) and many delayed/missing arrivals later \u2014 treat lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Recent demand has shifted higher with volatile spikes; use recent_N=5 to capture the latest regime (last five demands: P27-P31 = 121,107,156,150,0). Choosing recent_N for mu and sigma lets the OR backend target the current demand level while L=3 protects against observed prolonged delays and missing shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times but an average \u22482.08 periods (many 3s and 1s), so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes. On-hand=0 and in-transit=491 (large pipeline) so do not aggressively inflate demand forecast; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. These choices let the OR engine balance service (using observed lead-time average) vs holding cost given the large in-transit stock and limited on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed Ws include 1,2,3 with sustained 3-period episodes earlier). Several past missing/delayed shipments were recorded but recent pipeline is large (491). I choose to let the backend infer an empirical lead time average from observed concluded arrivals (method: calculate) so the system adapts to the mixed/shifted lead-time history. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable baseline that balances service (profit $4 vs hold $1) without overfitting short anomalies while the large pipeline de-risks stockouts.

Given clear variability and confirmed multi-period delays in history, set L by calculating the average observed lead time so the OR backend internalizes the true realized lead time. Use default demand and volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full historical demand to balance service vs holding given high pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Recent history shows variable but frequently long lead times (confirmed 3-periods earlier) and many delayed/lost arrivals; pipeline is large but visibility delayed. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures persistent variability seen in conclude messages). Demand has recently become more volatile with a notable uptick/spike in the last 5 periods (Periods 31-35 demands = 0,71,107,42,256); to react to this regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focuses forecast and volatility on the latest regime while keeping the OR engine's cap behavior conservative). These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat to cover recent spike) while sigma_hat recent estimate helps the backend set safety stock without overholding given high holding cost relative to profit.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but the average of observed lead times \u22482.0 (matches promised); choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed avg. Demand history is volatile but no clear recent sustained regime change; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples.

Pipeline (491) is large but some past shipments were delayed/lost; to let backend infer average actual lead time from confirmed concludes I choose 'calculate' for L so the OR engine uses observed lead-time data. Use default demand/volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with the inferred L and full historical samples. This balances service (profit>holding) by letting the engine set base-stock with observed lead-time and full-sample demand stats while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals average ~2.0 periods (multiple 3/1/2 observations across history). Recent demand is volatile with large spike at Period_35; last 5 realized demands (Periods 34-38) average ~124. I set L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (matches promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods, capturing the recent regime including the spike while keeping responsiveness. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (accounting for observed lead time and recent high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

With L=3 I use mu_hat default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and sigma_hat default (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses the full-scope demand estimate and variability over the review+lead window; this balances higher safety stock due to longer lead time against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Recent concluded lead times (14 observed) average 2.0, matching promised lead time. Pipeline (491) is large relative to recent single-period demands, so no aggressive upscale. Use calculated L to reflect observed average lead time; use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of samples) so the OR engine can compute base_stock and cap with full historical data. This balances service (using observed L) versus holding cost given high in-transit inventory and mixed arrival history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed arrivals P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16 and carry-over insight). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed realized lead time (promised=2 is stale). Using the seed demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) mean=96.8; with (1+L)=4 this yields mu_hat=4*96.8=387.2 as an explicit forecast for the review+lead period. Volatility from samples std\u224818.942 scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 gives sigma_hat\u224837.884; I provide this explicitly so the OR backend computes base_stock with the confirmed longer lead time and avoids under-ordering given many past delayed/lost shipments.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical concluded lead-times are variable but average ~1.93 periods (observations: 15 arrivals with mean \u22481.93). Large in-transit volume suggests shipments are flowing but with mixed delays; no clear recent demand regime shift in last samples (recent demands high-variance). To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time variability, I request L be calculated from observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (via backend's base-stock formula) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1. No explicit upward/downward adjustment to demand forecast now because evidence for a sustained demand regime change is weak.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) and full history show volatile demand with occasional spikes (e.g., P35=256, P29=156). Multiple past lead-time regimes observed (mixed 1\u20133 periods, with confirmed 3-period regime around P9\u2013P17), and earlier missing shipments were recorded, but no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change is evident in the recent conclude messages. Large in-transit suggests outstanding arrivals may cover upcoming demand but some earlier shipments were delayed\u2014so keep promised lead time to let OR engine use its assumed L and historical stats. I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples given no clear, sustained recent changepoint. This balances service level (use all-history demand) and holding cost given uncertainty about actual lead-time shifts and possible lost shipments.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Recent demand series is volatile with intermittent spikes but no new sustained regime change; on-hand=0, in-transit=491 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133), with prior carry-over confirming occasional 3-period delays but no new persistent shift since. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) so the OR engine uses the canonical L=2; mu_hat default and sigma_hat default to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a smoothed forecast and volatility estimate that balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical conclude messages show sustained longer lead times (confirmed as 3 periods around Periods 9-17); many late arrivals and past missing shipments. To protect service given observed lead-time=3, I set L explicitly to 3. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples, which balances forecasting with the longer review+lead horizon and avoids overfitting to recent noisy arrivals while accounting for higher inventory needed for service.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical concluded lead_times (observed arrivals) average ~2.0 periods (multiple 3s and 1s balanced), so use calculated L to reflect observed mean. Large in-transit suggests many outstanding orders will cover upcoming demand; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) against holding cost given the current pipeline. This choice is conservative given no new sustained changepoint since prior periods and avoids overreacting to intermittent 1- or 3-period arrivals.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical conclues show repeated multi-period delays with confirmed 3-period lead times earlier and many overdue arrivals; large pipeline present so treat lead time as 3 to be conservative. Use L explicit=3 to capture observed longer deliveries; use default demand and sigma so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting OR balance service vs holding given current pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=491 \u2014 substantial pipeline that may cover multiple periods but some past orders were delayed/lost; no new conclude in Period 48 to change lead-time belief. I choose L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history, capturing the multi-modal lead-time reality. For demand I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend uses all available historical demand samples (scaled by 1+L) \u2014 conservative given no clear, sustained demand regime change and to balance service vs holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.
