In-transit (423) comfortably exceeds expected remaining demand, so additional orders are unnecessary and would only increase end-of-horizon holding costs ($1/unit/period) while not increasing sales.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Observed on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 423. Using recent empirical single-period mean from available demand samples (~97 units/day), demand over (L+1)=3 periods \u2248 291 units. Even allowing for some lost/late shipments, pipeline (423) comfortably covers the next 3 periods of expected demand, so additional ordering risks unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) that reduce reward. OR also recommends 0; given abundant pipeline relative to (L+1) demand and uncertain supplier reliability (some past lost shipments), I follow the conservative choice of ordering 0 to avoid excess inventory and holding cost. Continue to monitor concluded arrivals to detect lost shipments or persistent lead-time shifts before changing policy.",
