Pipeline (411) > expected demand over (L+1) (388), so we already have sufficient coverage even accounting for lead_time=3. 4) Cost tradeoff: Profit=$1, Holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.5 implies no safety-stock bias; extra units impose equal holding cost as profit, so avoid over-ordering. 5) OR recommended 0 units (uses promised L and historical mean); given our actual lead time inference and large pipeline, ordering more would only increase holding cost with little benefit. Final decision: order 0 units for chips(Regular).",
