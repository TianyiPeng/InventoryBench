Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with no on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals. Promised lead time = 2 periods; no evidence to change it. Use default lead time. Use all available demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) to form baseline forecast: mean demand = 96.8 units; with L=2 the review+lead multiplier = 1+L = 3, so mu_hat = 3\xd7mean \u2248 290.4. Volatility: population std of samples \u2248 18.945, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a3 \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248 32.82. These choices provide the OR backend a baseline base-stock covering (L+1) periods of expected demand while reflecting observed variability; no overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (order placed P1 not yet concluded \u2014 this is expected given promised L=2; no concluded arrivals observed to infer a lead-time change). Demand history samples: [71,120,95,116,82], mean=96.8. Use default lead time (promised L=2) because there is no concluded evidence of delay or loss. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving service level while accounting for holding cost tradeoff.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=264 (two prior orders of 132 each), promised lead time=2. Concluded history shows no confirmed arrivals yet; insufficient evidence to change lead time (need sustained / concluded arrivals beyond promised lead). Demand history (all samples mean \u224896.8) used for forecast. I choose default lead time to keep model aligned with promise and because observed arrivals are not yet conclusive. I select default mu_hat so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to cover review+lead demand, balancing service level and holding cost given profit/holding ratio. I select default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) for uncertainty; this keeps orders responsive to inherent demand variability while avoiding overreaction to currently delayed arrivals which may be transient or lost.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: last 3 concluded demands = 110, 145, 113 (stronger than prior baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=354 (orders placed P1-P3 have not arrived). Promised L=2, but P1-P3 orders still unarrived (3 consecutive periods with zero arrivals) \u2014 flagged as potential delivery issue but not yet confirmed as permanent loss. I choose L=default to leave OR engine using promised lead time (we lack a confirmed concluded arrival to compute actual lead time). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the clear recent higher-demand regime: mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean(last3)=3*122.67\u2248368 units across review+lead. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These settings push the backend base-stock up to cover the elevated recent demand while keeping lead-time assumption at promised value; the carry-over insight flags the delivery concern for future reassessment.

Carry-over insight: Possible delivery/lead-time issue: orders placed P1(132), P2(132), P3(90) have not arrived by Period_4 conclude (3 consecutive periods with zero arrivals); monitor for lost shipments or lead-time >=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: on-hand=134, in-transit=175. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period_1 order arrived in Period_4 (lead_time=3), Period_3 order arrived in Period_4 (lead_time=1); Period_2 order (132) remains outstanding. I treat observed lead-time variability by using the calculated average lead time (uses concluded observations) so OR backend sees L consistent with recent evidence. Demand history mean ~96.8; with L\u22482 the default (1+L)\xd7mean gives coverage for review+lead. I select default volatility to let backend compute \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, giving a balanced safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5 mean=96.8) show no clear upward regime shift; current on-hand=99, in-transit=317 (total pipeline+on-hand=416) but there is evidence of delayed/lost shipments in history. Concluded arrivals show a P1 order arrived with lead_time=3 and a P3 order with lead_time=1; P2 order (132) remains unobserved and may be lost. I choose L via "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixture of 1 and 3). For demand I use "default" so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)\u2014keeps forecast anchored to full history given limited data and mixed lead times. For sigma_hat I use "default" so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (by increasing review+lead coverage given realized longer lead) vs. holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods for at least one order (P1 ordered Period_1 arrived Period_4); possible lost shipment: order from Period_2 (132 units) remains unobserved by Period_5 conclude and may be lost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=343. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period_1\u2192Period_4 (LT=3) and Period_3\u2192Period_4 (LT=1); Period_2 order remains unobserved and may be lost. To account for observed variability in lead time while remaining responsive, I set L using recent_N (N=2) to average the two observed lead times (3 and 1). Demand forecast uses default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default sigma to let the OR backend compute base_stock and cap using full historical samples; this avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while the lead-time uncertainty is explicitly captured by L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7) and one 1-period (P3->P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=400 \u2014 significant pipeline but past shipments were delayed/lost earlier. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time regime (protect against undersupply). mu_hat default uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to scale demand over review+lead period given confirmed longer lead time. sigma_hat default keeps volatility based on all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) given confirmed longer lead times and costly stockouts (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7)

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=130, in-transit=191. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,3,1) with multiple confirmations of 3-period deliveries and some 1-periods; some orders delayed/lost earlier. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (reflecting mix and recent confirmations of 3). Demand history (samples: 71,120,95,116,82) shows no sustained regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes review+lead demand and volatility consistently with chosen L. This balances service (capturing longer observed lead times) vs holding cost by letting the engine compute safety stock from profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 10. On-hand=62, in-transit=274. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times observed = {3,1,3,3,1,1} with multiple confirmations of L=3 for several orders; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand samples available (Period_1-5) and promised lead time used by backend; to remain consistent and let OR engine compute base_stock with full-sample stats, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level given confirmed longer lead times while avoiding overreacting to short-run demand noise; high pipeline (274) already provides coverage so no explicit mu/sigma inflation is applied here.

Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=357. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence includes 3,1,3,3,1,1 \u2192 avg\u22482), so stick with promised lead time. Demand historical samples (Period_1\u20135) mean=96.8; using default formulas with L=promised keeps (1+L)\xd7mean demand and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let the OR backend set a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. Defaults also avoid overreacting to intermittent 1- and 3-period arrivals and protect service given large in-transit volume.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=357. Historical concluded lead-time observations show several 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) so actual lead time > promised; recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 72,112,101,121,67) mean=94.6. I set L using observed average lead times to capture the longer realized lead-time (so backend accounts for multi-period pipeline). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (N=5) to reflect the current demand regime; (1+L) scaling will let the OR engine size orders for the review+lead period. This balances service (covering multi-period demand given longer lead time) against holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from updated mean and volatility estimates. Current in-transit (357) appears sufficient versus the forecasted (1+L)*mean demand but will be re-evaluated as more conclude messages arrive.

Observed lead times (from conclude messages) show mixed values with recent observed lead times = [1,3,2]; average of last 3 = 2.0 so I set L via recent_N to capture the most recent regime. Demand samples show no strong sustained shift; using recent 5-period demand for mu_hat captures recent demand (~101.6 mean) while respecting review+lead scaling. Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (using recent lead-time evidence) against holding cost by not overreacting to single-period spikes and by using recent demand for the base-stock calculation.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) with occasional 1-2 period arrivals; average observed lead time > promised 2. Use calculated average lead time to reflect realized delays so OR orders cover longer pipeline. Demand historical samples (provided) will use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = default to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances higher service risk (longer L) versus holding cost by letting OR compute the safety stock from updated L and full-sample demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12; multiple 3-period occurrences over several periods)

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=408. History shows repeated 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) indicating actual lead time = 3. Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent pattern is consistent. I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture the confirmed 3-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the OR engine raises target stock for the longer lead time while keeping variance estimation broad; this balances higher service level (given profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost and accounts for delayed arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (observed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15) though some 1-2 period observations exist. I therefore let backend compute average observed lead time (method: calculate) so L reflects the mixed but multiple 3-period confirmations. Demand samples (Periods 1-5: 71,120,95,116,82) are limited; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service (capturing longer observed lead times) against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=43, in-transit=305. History shows repeated 3-period arrivals; several orders also showed 1\u20132 period draws. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time (captures the sustained shift toward 3). Demand history (provided samples) is limited to the five sample periods, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for the inferred longer lead time. This balances higher service-level needs from longer/more-variable lead time against holding cost given on-hand + large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (sustained evidence: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent demand has averaged ~91.8 over last 5 periods (P13-17) with volatile but sustained ~3-period lead-time evidence through P17. On-hand=98, in-transit=207 (sufficient pipeline). I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual arrivals (multiple P->P+3 observations). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (mean \u224891.8) and scale by (1+L)=4 for the review+lead period. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older data. These choices align orders with the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand, limiting stockouts while avoiding excess holding costs.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=315. Historical concluded arrivals show many 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17) though some 1\u20132 period observations exist. I therefore let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate) to capture this mixed but skewed-to-3 pattern. Demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) will be rolled up by the backend using the chosen L, so I request default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order. This balances higher effective lead-time coverage while avoiding manual over/under-adjustment given mixed short/long observations and the large in-transit stock.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 start. Recent concluded history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 (multiple observations: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16). On-hand=0, in-transit=411 which exceeds (1+L)*mean historical demand, so pipeline likely covers near-term demand. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (robust given limited sample set). This balances service (use confirmed longer lead time) while avoiding aggressive extra stock because current in-transit inventory already exceeds expected demand over the review+lead period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=455. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple sustained 3-period lead-time observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17) but some 1\u20132 period cases exist. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed but predominantly 3). With L determined from observed lead times, I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (raising target stock for longer effective lead time) against holding cost while accounting for the confirmed longer lead-time regime and current large in-transit volume.

To ensure pipeline coverage over review+lead, set L explicitly to 3. Demand history shows no recent sustained mean shift; use default aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This increases requested pipeline to cover the longer confirmed lead time while letting the OR engine compute safety stock tradeoff using profit/holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=469, recent demands historically volatile (samples: 71,120,95,116,82). Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3). Promised lead time=2 but evidence supports actual lead time=3; using a lead-time estimate that reflects observed behavior reduces stockouts and accounts for delayed/lost shipments. I select L="calculate" so backend uses observed lead times average (capturing the persistent 3-period pattern). For demand forecast and volatility I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the full-scope historical mean/variance over the chosen lead+review horizon. This balances higher safety stock needed under longer lead time against holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16); sustained evidence across multiple periods.

On-hand=0, in-transit=411 so pipeline sizable but arrivals will occur with L\u22483. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time (helps avoid under-ordering due to promised L=2). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given validated longer lead time and limited recent data.

Use lead-time averaging (calculate) so backend learns observed LT. Demand has recent variability; I use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility to focus the forecast on the latest regime (backend will scale by 1+L). This balances service (higher L => larger review+lead demand) against holding cost given profit=4, holding=1.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period_26: history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23). On-hand=0, in-transit=492 (large pipeline). To reflect observed reality and avoid chronic under-ordering, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples (captures demand across review+lead). This balances higher safety stock for the longer observed lead time against holding cost while leveraging the backend's capped ordering.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=492 (useful pipeline). Given sustained evidence I set lead time explicitly to 3 to align forecasting with observed arrivals. Demand samples mean=96.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat (which apply (1+L) scaling) gives the OR engine a (1+L)-adjusted forecast and volatility that balance service (high profit $4 vs holding $1 => higher target fill) while accounting for longer confirmed lead time and current sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_28. On-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical conclude messages show many observed lead times, with multiple 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23) indicating actual lead time > promised 2 in many cases. To let the OR engine infer the most accurate lead-time from observed data, choose L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history is limited and no clear recent demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given lead-time uncertainty. This configuration addresses delayed/lost shipments by letting L reflect realized delays while keeping demand estimates broad.

Period_29 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical conclude messages show sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23). To reflect true delivery timing I set L explicit=3. Demand appears volatile with recent stockouts and shifts; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime so the OR base-stock better balances service vs holding given the longer effective lead time and large pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent history shows repeated confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and long runs of zero on-hand with large in-transit = 492. On-hand 0 + in-transit 492 likely contains outstanding 3-period pipeline; several earlier orders were delayed or lost but sustained evidence supports using L=3. I set L explicit=3 to align forecasts with observed arrivals. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sampled demand history so base-stock and caps reflect the longer review+lead window; this raises target inventory to cover additional periods while the explicit L handles the observed longer lead time and reduces stockouts from underestimated pipeline timing.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period actual lead times (many P->P+3 arrivals) though promised L=2; several orders were delayed earlier but recent pattern is sustained. Pipeline (492) is large relative to recent demand; risk of holding cost if we overstock but also prior stockouts occurred when shipments were delayed. I set L to 'calculate' so the OR backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the sustained ~3-period pattern). For demand forecast and volatility I choose defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages all historical demand data and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and large pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical concludes show repeated actual lead_time=3 for many orders (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23). Given sustained 3-period realizations and multiple lost/delayed shipments earlier, set L using observed lead times (calculate) so backend learns actual average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set\u2014this balances service level against holding cost while leveraging the inferred longer lead time. Parameters will let the engine size orders to cover the longer, confirmed pipeline exposure while capping via its internal cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (sustained evidence: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23).

To align OR engine to observed reality and ensure sufficient cover for the (L+1) review+lead window, set lead time explicitly to 3.

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations).

I set mu_hat explicit to (1+L)*mean(historical sample mean 96.8) = 387.2 to target adequate coverage given the confirmed longer lead time. I set sigma_hat explicit to 37.88 (sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 2*18.94) to reflect observed demand volatility. These parameters prioritize service (profit/unit $4 vs holding $1) while acknowledging holding cost by not inflating safety stock excessively.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: recent history shows many delayed arrivals and stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Concluded arrivals data provide sustained evidence that actual lead time is 3 periods (multiple orders show 3-period lag). To ensure pipeline covers demand during review+lead, set L explicitly to 3.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical conclude messages show repeated actual lead time = 3 periods (many orders observed arriving 3 periods after ordering) and some 1-2 period arrivals; several shipments previously unobserved for promised L=2. To capture the sustained shift to longer deliveries, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend will infer the higher average. Demand forecasting uses default (all-sample) mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, balancing service against holding cost while relying on the backend to apply the capped order cap given pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (sustained evidence: observed arrivals P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: sustained evidence (many concluded arrivals) confirms actual lead time = 3 periods despite promised=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=492 (covers upcoming arrivals but arrivals are only visible after conclude). Use explicit L=3 to reflect true arrival timing so OR backend plans for 4-period coverage (review+lead). Demand baseline: historical sample mean=96.8 (from provided five samples). With L=3, set mu_hat using default ((1+L)*mean) to capture expected demand over review+lead. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std) to reflect increased variability over a 4-period horizon. These settings align ordering to cover (L+1) periods of demand given observed 3-period lead time and avoid underordering from assuming promised shorter lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations); pipeline = 492, on-hand = 0. Historical sample mean = 96.8 units; with L=3 the review+lead horizon = 4 periods \u2192 default mu_hat \u2248 4\xd7mean = 387.2. Pipeline (492) comfortably covers the (1+L)-period demand, so no aggressive up-weighting of demand or volatility is needed. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting its capped ordering rule account for pipeline and caps. This aligns orders with observed 3-period arrivals and avoids overordering while maintaining service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observed arrivals with lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=492 (covers several future periods but arrivals will occur with 3-period lag). Promised L=2 is inconsistent with observed pattern; use explicit L=3 to align forecast horizon with realized arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples with L=3, balancing service level (higher coverage for 3-period lead) against holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows repeated, sustained confirmations that actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=492. To align OR inputs with observed reality I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the engine compute the base-stock and cap using the empiric demand stats and the inferred lead time. This balances service (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals with W=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=492 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists. Demand samples (provided Periods1-5) have mean ~96.8; with confirmed L=3 the (1+L) review+lead multiplier =4. To reflect sustained lead-time shift and avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost, set L explicitly to 3 so backend sizes pipeline appropriately. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, leveraging all data and the confirmed L to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L explicit=3 to match observed reality so the OR engine plans across the correct pipeline length. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable forecast and volatility estimate while accounting for the longer lead time; this balances higher service-level needs (longer coverage) with holding cost through the backend cap.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45. Demand has been consistently observed in concluded periods (many ~100s); on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Multiple concluded messages across history confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods (orders from P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, etc.). Use L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time (captures persistent 3-period realized lead time vs promised 2). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand to balance service level vs holding cost given long in-transit pipeline and confirmed longer lead time. This choice avoids overreacting to recent stockouts while correcting lead-time underestimate.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals across many orders (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23), so I will let backend compute an average observed lead time to capture this shift. Use 'calculate' for L to let OR infer the empiric lead time (expected \u22483). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time while leveraging full sample history. I flag in the rationale that pipeline (492) likely covers multiple future periods, so relying on backend aggregate forecast avoids over-ordering while the OR cap will limit single-period receipts.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_47: history shows repeated concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observations P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P12->P15, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=492 (some of which correspond to multi-period transit). Given sustained evidence of lead-time=3 (promised was 2) I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) so the engine uses realized data. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, keeping demand forecasting simple and letting the backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff; this balances service level (cover longer pipeline) against holding costs given high in-transit volume.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples; this leverages the backend's data-driven base-stock while our explicit L corrects for the persistent longer lead time and helps balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Concluded history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23) implying actual lead time \u22483 (promised=2). Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent history is consistently showing 3. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average (captures sustained 3-period pattern). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from provided samples) to let OR engine balance service vs. holding cost given updated L. This leverages confirmed longer lead time while relying on historical demand samples for forecast.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (sustained evidence: observed arrivals P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23).
