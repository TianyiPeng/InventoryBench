Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time \u22653 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12); supplier is unreliable so assume actual L\u22483. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=540. Demand estimate: use recent empirical single-period mean from early samples (Periods 1\u20135) \u03bc\u224896.8 \u224897 units; (L+1)=4 \u2192 expected demand over coverage window \u2248388 units. Pipeline (540) > coverage need (\u2248388), so no urgent order needed. Risk assessment: some in-transit units have been lost/delayed historically, but pipeline still comfortably exceeds 4-period demand even allowing for moderate losses; placing new order would incur holding cost while arrivals are uncertain given long lead times. OR recommended 0 (uses promised L=2); I agree but with a conservative assumption of L=3, so order 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost and potential overstock from late deliveries. Final strategy: place 0 units this period, monitor upcoming 'Period 50 conclude' for actual arrivals to update lead-time belief and decide in next period.",
