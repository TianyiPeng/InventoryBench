Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start, no on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default). Demand history (Periods 1\u20135) shows mean=96.8; with L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from all samples to let OR backend set base stock and cap given no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. No concluded arrivals yet (Period_1 conclude shows ordered=132 arrived=0), so actual lead time unknown; use promised lead time. Historical demand mean = 96.8 units/period (5 samples). On-hand 0 + in-transit 132 < expected (1+L) demand, so we rely on the OR engine's default base-stock calculation with promised L to replenish. Methods chosen to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and scaled std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=264 (two outstanding orders of 132). Promised lead time=2. Recent observed sold demand (Period2 conclude) is elevated vs historical but only two post-change samples (110,145) \u2014 insufficient (need \u22653) to declare a sustained regime shift. I therefore keep L as default (use promised lead time) to avoid prematurely assuming lost shipments. For demand I use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) to weight recent higher observed demand while still anchoring to historical samples; this adapts faster than full-sample mean but remains conservative. Volatility uses default to reflect long-run sample variability for the (1+L) review+lead window. These settings balance service level (respond to recent demand uptick) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain lead-time realizations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent observed demand samples (Period_1-5): mean=96.8 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=430 units (orders from Periods 1-3 still not concluded). Promised lead time=2 but three consecutive orders (P1:132, P2:132, P3:166) have not arrived by their expected conclude windows, suggesting shipments are delayed or lost; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly longer to cover demand while in-transit uncertainty persists. Parameters chosen: L explicit=3 to increase coverage of pipeline and avoid stockouts given missing arrivals; mu_hat default uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples so it scales demand forecast for the longer review+lead period; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all) to increase safety stock for higher uncertainty. This balances higher service level (reduce lost sales) against holding cost by using a modest increase in lead time rather than extreme safety cushions.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (132,132,166 = 430 units) remain unarrived by Period_3 conclude, indicating persistent delivery issues or lost shipments; treat lead time as longer until arrivals are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1462.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (Period1 order arrived in Period4 with lead_time=3; Period3 order arrived in Period4 with lead_time=1) and Period2's order remains unarrived\u2014evidence of variable/extended deliveries. On-hand=210 + in-transit=205 =415 units, which currently covers multiple periods of demand (sample mean ~96.8). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times to reflect the variable actual lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $490.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed arrivals: P1\u2192arrived at P4, lead_time=3; P3\u2192arrived at P4, lead_time=1). On-hand=175, in-transit=283 (total 458) which covers several periods of demand given sample mean. There is at least one overdue/lost shipment (P2 order still unarrived). To balance service level vs holding cost I use calculated lead time (avg of observed lead times = 2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock formula while accounting for the inferred average lead time; defaults keep estimates robust to the mixed/partial arrival history and avoid overfitting to a short recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1945.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_7. Recent history shows arrivals in Period_4 revealing realized lead times: Period1\u2192Period4 = 3, Period3\u2192Period4 = 1 (observed lead times {3,1}). On-hand=69, in-transit=316 (some in-transit orders remain overdue). Because observed lead times vary, use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) show no sustained recent regime shift, so use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula while accounting for the inferred average lead time. This balances service level (captures lead-time uncertainty) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1298.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclues show realized lead times = 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7). I set L to recent_N over the last 3 observed lead times (avg \u22482.33) to reflect the longer-than-promised deliveries while smoothing a transient short lead. On-hand=70 and in-transit=348; prior missing/delayed shipments suggest using the calculated longer lead to inflate the review+lead demand. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1987.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=141, in-transit=227, recent demands (Periods1-5): [71,120,95,116,82] with realized arrivals showing variable lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3,3,1). There remain prior delayed shipments but pipeline is non-empty. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the mixed 1\u20133 period reality). For demand scale and uncertainty I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this yields conservative replenishment that accounts for the longer/variable lead time while avoiding manual overcorrection given limited sample size.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times vary across recent concludes (periods with lead_time = 3,1,3,3,1); average observed lead time \u2248 2.2 periods (Periods 4\u20138).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=102, in-transit=279 (total pipeline 381). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [3,1,3,3,1,1] (avg=2.0), indicating actual lead time differs from promised at times. I select L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so forecasts reflect full review+lead horizon without overfitting to short-term noise. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given the observed lead-time evidence. On-hand + in-transit (381) appears sufficient for several periods of recent demand (mean demand \u2248 100), but using calculated L ensures pipeline coverage is correctly scaled.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=359. Recent concluded lead times vary (observed 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 avg \u22482.2), and earlier periods showed missing/delayed shipments, so use observed-average lead time estimation. Demand recently has been higher (last 5 concluded demands: 106,72,112,101,121; mean\u2248102.4). To balance service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost $1, use recent demand statistics to capture the current regime while letting the backend compute exact base-stock using its formulas. L: infer from observed lead times (calculate). mu_hat & sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime and to protect against repeating delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=444. Historical concludes show variable lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,3,1 across recent concludes) with average ~2.2 and multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier; treat lead time as the empirically observed average (let backend compute). Use default demand aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and default volatility; this balances service (capture longer empirical L) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Pipeline is sizable so no urgent stockout risk, but lead-time variability persists. I choose L='calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (captures longer observed lead time) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=356. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods) and past prolonged delays; using observed lead-time average lets backend adapt to this variability. I use recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the most recent demand regime (periods 9\u201313: 101,121,67,107,130) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect current demand and volatility while (with L calculated) the OR engine will size orders to cover review+lead demand and account for pipeline. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by basing lead-time on observed behavior rather than the promised value, and by using recent demand to avoid under/overstock from outdated samples.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=377. Historical concludes show variable/extended lead times (observed lead times include 1,2,3 with average ~2.2) and past multi-period missing arrivals\u2014treat lead time longer than promised. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average. For demand forecast and volatility I use default rules so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this relies on the inferred L and keeps mu/sigma aligned with full-sample demand while the backend caps orders to limit exposure given delayed arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=444; recent concludes show mixed lead times (1\u20133) with average \u22482.2 and multiple multi-period delays and previously missing shipments. Treat actual lead time as longer than promised by using calculate (average of observed lead times) for L so backend infers prevailing lead time from concluded history. Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling is applied to full-sample mean and std, preserving historical demand signal while letting OR engine compute safety stock given the inferred L. This balances higher service level (longer/variable lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=51, in-transit=339. Recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders with lead_time=3 across Periods 4\u201316), so I treat actual lead time as higher than promised and let the backend compute an averaged lead time from observations. I use 'calculate' for L to capture the empirical average lead time, and default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level (captures longer lead time) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals with lead_time=3 for orders: P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=65, in-transit=283. Historical concluded arrivals show many lead_time=3 observations (recent sequence dominated by 3s) but some 1s and 2s; average observed lead_time \u22482.42. Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost, so I use an empirically estimated lead time (calculate) to reflect real-world delays rather than the promised 2. I select mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend scale demand and volatility for the inferred lead time. This balances service (by increasing pipeline cover when L>2) against holding cost given holding is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent concludes show consistent 3-period arrivals (Period 17 confirmed lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=374 \u2014 significant pipeline but past delays observed. I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual LT and avoid under-ordering. With L=3 I use default demand estimators so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this balances service vs holding cost using full-sample stats while accounting for longer effective pipeline.

Current Period 20. Recent conclude messages show multiple observed lead_times = 3 (confirmed by arrivals P4->P7, P5->P8, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16 and others), so set L explicitly to 3 to reflect actual delivery timing. Recent demand has risen and become volatile (last 5 demands: P15\u2013P19 = 93, 54, 92, 157, 150); use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current higher, variable regime and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: recent demand has been volatile with multiple stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=580. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained lead time of 3 periods (confirmed by multiple P4->P7, P5->P8, P11->P14, etc.). To protect service while acknowledging delays, I set lead time explicitly to 3. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances provisioning for longer lead time against holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1). This approach leverages the confirmed LT=3 while relying on full-sample demand estimates to smooth recent volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=580. Recent conclude history shows frequent 3-period lead times (many orders with lead_time=3; Period_17 confirmed lead time=3). Several past shipments were delayed/lost earlier but recent pattern is longer lead times. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the recent shift to ~3). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap with consistent historical demand statistics. This balances service (higher L -> larger review+lead demand forecast) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline; no new sustained demand regime detected, so defaults are appropriate.

Period 23. Recent conclude history shows multiple observed lead_times = 3 (consistent since Period 17), and several earlier delayed/lost arrivals\u2014treat actual lead time longer than promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=580 (large pipeline arriving under multi-period lead times). I select L via 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures confirmed LT=3). For demand forecast and volatility I use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level against holding cost using full-sample stats while respecting the inferred longer lead time and large pipeline. No explicit adjustments to mu/sigma to avoid overreacting to intermittent spikes given existing large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=3, in-transit=489 (total pipeline=492). Recent conclude history shows multiple lead_time=3 observations (lead_time often 3); pipeline large so risk of overstock if L underestimated. I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized longer lead times. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales (1+L) by overall sample mean/variance; this balances service (higher L raises mu_hat) with holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals across history), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect realized transit times and avoid under-ordering. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; with L=3 this raises target pipeline to cover 4 periods of demand, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) against holding cost when shipments are delayed.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes show persistent 3-period arrivals and Period_17 confirmed lead time=3. Large in-transit (623) and zero on-hand -> treat actual lead time as 3 to ensure pipeline covers demand during long transit. Use L explicit=3 to force OR to plan for longer arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples (captures full sample variability). This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) by keeping service with moderate safety stock while avoiding excessive explicit forecasting adjustments.

Use explicit L=3 to force the OR engine to cover the longer pipeline delay. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this raises order targets to protect service during prolonged lead times while the low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) keeps overstock risk moderate.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3 and lead-time confirmed as 3 at Period 17) despite promised L=2; several earlier shipments were delayed/lost. To be conservative and cover demand during the longer effective pipeline, I explicitly set L=3. Demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) have mean\u224896.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which will scale safety stock appropriately for the longer lead time while respecting the backend cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts given many delayed shipments) vs. holding cost by keeping demand forecasting anchored to historical samples but accounting for longer lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: recent concluded history shows a sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 through Period_17 and later Period_23 arrival from P20). On-hand=0, in-transit=623 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals follow L=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed operational lead time. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (conservative pooling of available demand samples) which balances required safety stock for longer lead time against holding cost given high profit margin (profit $19 vs holding $1). This conservatively maintains service while avoiding excessive orders because significant pipeline already exists.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concluded arrivals show varied lead times but a preponderance of 3-period arrivals with some 1\u20132 period observations; average of observed lead times is above the promised 2. To capture this, I ask the backend to calculate L from observed concludes (method=calculate). Demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples) shows no sustained recent regime shift; use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (by using observed longer lead times) against holding cost via the OR engine's base-stock formula.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations and Period_17 confirmed lead time=3; some 1\u20132 period arrivals exist but 3 is dominant. Many earlier orders were delayed/lost but current pipeline is large. To protect service given observed sustained LT=3, I set L explicitly to 3 (longer than promised 2). I use default demand estimators so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances demand coverage over the 4-period review+lead window while keeping volatility estimation anchored to full history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show persistent 3-period arrivals (lead_time=3 confirmed by multiple periods up to Period 17) and many late/missing earlier shipments, so treat current effective lead time as 3 to avoid underordering. Demand history samples (71,120,95,116,82) used with L=3; I choose default demand/volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a multi-period forecast that balances service vs. holding cost while accounting for longer lead time and large pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals and carry-over confirms lead time=3 (sustained). Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Demand recently: last 5 observed demands (Periods 30\u201334) = [55,138,49,27,29]; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture current regime; use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise pipeline cover for the longer lead time while sizing orders to recent demand to limit holding cost given high in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3 through Period_17); pipeline is large but arrivals will occur with 3-period lag. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand shows no new sustained regime since last confirmation, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock grounded in full-sample statistics while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time to balance service level versus holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37. Recent history shows multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (Period 17 confirmed lead time=3 across many orders) and persistent past delays; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=623 suggesting shipments are outstanding and lead time is longer than promised. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed true lead time. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so forecast covers 4 periods of demand based on historical mean (conservative given long lead time). sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to scale variability for the longer replenishment horizon. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given many in-transit units and confirmed longer lead time while controlling holding cost via backend cap.

Period 38. On-hand=0, in-transit=623 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show many lead_time=3 arrivals and Period_17 confirmed lead_time=3 from multiple orders; several earlier shipments were delayed/lost. To be conservative and cover observed delivery delays I set L explicit=3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies the base-stock calculation with the longer lead time and existing demand statistics, balancing service vs holding given high in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4\u201317) repeatedly show actual lead_time=3 for many orders and Period_17 explicitly confirmed lead_time=3; no subsequent concludes contradict this. Promised lead time=2 but shipment behavior indicates a sustained longer lead time. I therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery delays. For demand forecasting I use the default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of provided samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps based on established sample statistics while accounting for the longer effective lead time. This keeps pipeline targets sufficient to cover the review+lead period and reduces stockouts given the confirmed longer lead time while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Recent concluded lead-times show majority = 3 periods (sustained since Period_17), so use observed-average lead time; demand has been elevated recently (Periods 35-39 demands = 164,111,110,101,120; recent mean \u2248121). Reconcile: large in-transit (623) likely covers multiple periods given L\u22483; but on-hand=0 so risk of stockouts this period if arrivals delayed. Choices: L by "calculate" to reflect average observed lead time; mu_hat by "recent_N" with N=5 to focus on recent higher demand (captures (1+L)\xd7recent mean); sigma_hat by "recent_N" N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings bias orders toward higher coverage for the longer observed lead time and recent demand spike while letting OR backend cap the order size.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show multiple lead_time=3 observations and lead time previously confirmed at 3 (Period 17), indicating actual lead time > promised. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility use 'default' so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine compute base_stock from full-sample statistics. This approach acknowledges longer empirical lead times while using all demand history to balance service level vs. holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show persistent multi-period arrivals with lead_time=3 repeatedly (Periods 4\u201317 evidence); shipments have been delayed vs promised 2. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time, and use default demand/volatility methods so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this keeps forecasts grounded in full history while the explicit L protects against stockouts from delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show persistent multi-period arrivals with many lead_time=3 observations (lead-time confirmed as 3 in prior periods) and intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals; pipeline is large but delayed. I choose L="calculate" so the backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures recent 3-period pattern while allowing for variation). For demand I use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all historical samples, balancing service level (profit high vs. holding cost) without overfitting recent noise given large in-transit balance.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show persistent delayed arrivals and lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 17 evidence). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the backend plans across the longer pipeline. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages all historical demand samples while the explicit L accounts for delayed shipments and helps the OR engine size orders to cover the longer replenishment horizon, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=45. On-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent multi-period delays with many lead_time=3 observations (Period 4 onward) and lead times averaging >2; pipeline (623) is already large relative to ~100/unit typical demand so no aggressive upward demand forecast needed. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-time concludes so the OR engine uses empirical average (captures the frequent 3-period lead time). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the calculated L and current large pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals and prior confirmed lead_time=3 signals; promised L=2 appears optimistic. Use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures shifts/lost shipments). Recent demand (Periods 41\u201345 = 101,112,72,105,80) averages ~94 \u2014 use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor forecast to the latest regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices aim to increase supply lead coverage while keeping holding cost modest given large in-transit stock.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical conclude messages (Period_17 evidence and multiple P->P+3 arrivals) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and persistent delayed shipments; therefore set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat method=default and sigma_hat method=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this scales forecasts and uncertainty for the longer lead time and lets the capped ordering rule manage pipeline exposure given large in-transit inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=623 (large pipeline likely contains previously delayed shipments). Historical concluded arrivals show persistent multi-period delays with many lead_time=3 observations and some 1\u20132s; overall average lead time is above the promised 2. I choose L=calculate so the backend uses the empirically observed average lead time. For demand forecast I use defaults (mu_hat and sigma_hat = default) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service vs holding cost given uncertain but sizable pipeline and confirmed longer lead times.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. On-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes (Periods 4\u201317 and later) consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods; many past orders were delayed/lost when assuming promised=2. Reconcile: large pipeline (623) likely from prior orders with 3-period realizations; treat lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering and stockouts. Set L by explicit=3 to reflect confirmed delivery pattern. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over full sample history, letting the OR engine size base-stock with increased review+lead coverage. This balances higher service level (covering 3-period lead) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=623. Historical concludes show frequent actual lead_times often =3 (multiple confirms through Period_17) and variability thereafter. Given persistent delayed arrivals earlier and mixed observed lead times, I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded history (method=calculate). I use default demand forecasting (no strong, recent demand regime shift in the last >3 periods of concluded arrivals) so mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (capture observed longer lead times) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock using the empirically estimated L and standard formulas.
