Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Inventory & lead-time inference: On-hand=0, in-transit=1330. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time \u22483 periods (carry-over insight already records this). Demand regime since Period 15 is elevated (~250\u2013320 per period); recent periods (24\u201349) mostly in the 200\u2013360 range. Forecast & coverage: using the confirmed actual lead time = 3, decision should cover (L+1)=4 upcoming periods. Conservative single-period demand estimate \u2248 300 (based on sustained recent demands). Required pipeline to cover 4 periods \u2248 4\xd7300 = 1200 units. Since in-transit 1330 > 1200, we already have sufficient pipeline to cover expected demand through the lead horizon. Cost tradeoff: profit $19 >> holding $1, but additional ordering now would only increase holding cost without improving service (pipeline already adequate) and risks further overstock if demand falls. OR recommended 0 (uses promised L and historical mean); given actual lead time=3 and large confirmed pipeline, I follow OR and order 0. Final decision: no order to avoid unnecessary holding costs and because pipeline > (L+1)\xd7expected demand.",
