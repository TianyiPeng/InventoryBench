Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history established actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12). With L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of upcoming demand in decision. Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=1217. Demand outlook: sustained high-regime demand (~~250\u2013330 per period since Period 16; average \u2248 ~290) per recent periods. Required coverage for 4 periods \u2248 4 \xd7 290 = 1160 units. In-transit (1217) already exceeds the 4-period coverage target, so no additional ordering is warranted now. Ordering more would raise holding cost with no clear unmet demand before arrivals. OR recommended 0 units; I agree given confirmed lead time=3 and the large in-transit balance. Final action: order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while pipeline suffices.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 confirmed lead time = 3, in-transit 1217 already covers ~4 periods of sustained high demand (~290/day), so additional units would only increase holding cost.",
