Given that variability, use conservative effective lead time = 3 periods -> plan to cover L+1 = 4 periods of demand. Inventory math: on-hand = 0; in-transit = 219 units but a large portion likely corresponds to the previously-lost Period-6 order; treat only a small portion of in-transit as reliable.
