Any order placed in Period 49 would arrive no earlier than Period 52 and thus cannot be used during the remaining game periods (49\u201350). On-hand = 0 but in-transit = 1244 units, which is ample to cover expected remaining demand (recent per-period demand ~240\u2013310; two remaining periods \u2248 480\u2013620 units). Ordering now would only increase holding cost after arrivals and cannot increase sales before the game ends.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Use L_actual=3 when checking coverage. Demand assessment: recent periods show high sustained demand after Period 16; last three periods demands = 313, 311, 316 (avg \u2248 313). Coverage target: with L_actual=3 we need to cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand because current period demand occurs after decision. Estimated 4-period demand \u2248 4 \xd7 313 = 1252 units. Inventory state: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 1244 units. Pipeline (1244) \u2248 required coverage (1252), within rounding and given q=0.5 (no safety stock). Ordering now would arrive too late to affect earlier periods and risks incurring holding cost equal to profit. OR recommended 0; I agree and place 0 to avoid excess holding cost while pipeline already nearly satisfies 4-period demand. Final action: order 0 units.",
