Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand = (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91.0 units, with no evidence yet of a sustained regime shift (only 5 samples, one low outlier Period_2). Promised lead time = 2 periods and no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost by letting the OR engine set safety stock via the profit/(profit+holding) ratio. This approach is conservative given zero on-hand/in-transit and limited history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order of 143 shows arrived=0 as expected with promised lead_time\u22651). Cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment from available history. Demand historical samples mean = 91 units/period (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). Use promised lead time (default) so backend computes base_stock with L=promised (2). Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine size orders; current in-transit=143 is below (1+L)\xd7mean = 273, so backlog will be addressed by the ordering policy. This conservative choice avoids overreacting to a single delayed conclude while allowing the OR engine cap to limit order spikes.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=279, two prior orders (P1,P2) still not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 possible delay but not yet confirmed lost. Use promised lead time (default) because we only have two missed arrivals (need \u22653 sustained periods to confirm lead-time change). Demand history mean=91 (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). With L=2 default, set mu_hat and sigma_hat to backend defaults so base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). Current pipeline (279) roughly equals the default mu_hat (~273), so this balances service level vs holding cost while waiting for confirmation of shipment loss or lead-time change.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=367. Historical demand samples mean=91 units/period (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). No concluded arrivals yet (all prior orders still unconfirmed), so actual lead time cannot be inferred\u2014use promised lead time. To balance service vs holding cost I use defaults: L=promised (keeps OR engine's lead-time assumption), mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean uses full-sample mean to forecast across review+lead period, sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std uses full-sample volatility. This leverages the full historical demand while remaining conservative given many units already in transit and uncertain arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1489.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start. History shows variable actual lead times (Order P1 arrived in P4 => LT=3; Order P3 arrived in P4 => LT=1). On-hand=145, in-transit=136 => total pipeline+on-hand=281. Historical demand samples mean=91 units/period (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let backend set L=2 (method: calculate) to reflect variability. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L\u22482 this yields (1+L)\xd7mean\u2248273, which is slightly below current inventory+pipeline (281), balancing service vs holding cost and accounting for possible delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $955.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_6. Historical demand samples mean = 91 (Periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: one order (P1\u2192P4) had lead_time=3, another (P3\u2192P4) had lead_time=1; some recent orders not yet concluded. I choose L by "calculate" (backend will average observed lead times -> ~2) to reflect measured variability rather than promised=2 or a single recent value. For demand I use "default" so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which yields coverage for the review+lead horizon while keeping estimation anchored to full sample history. For sigma_hat I use "default" to let backend scale observed variability by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (high profit = $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock (274) and on-hand 90; using historical-average demand avoids overreacting to short recent dips while acknowledging variable lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=365. History shows mixed actual lead times observed (order P1 arrived after 3 periods; P3 after 1 period). Some earlier orders (e.g., P2) remain in-transit with no conclude yet. Evidence is insufficient for a sustained lead-time shift (only two observed leads: 3 and 1), so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed leads. Demand history (periods 1\u20135 samples: 105,36,108,110,96) will be used by backend defaults to set mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on observed lead-time average while using full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise or possible lost shipments.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (order on P1 arrived in P4 => LT=3; order on P3 arrived in P4 => LT=1). Pipeline is large so avoid overreacting to short sample of LT variability. Choose L method='calculate' to average observed lead times (uses available concluded LT evidence). Use mu_hat and sigma_hat 'default' so backend computes demand across (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding given large in-transit stock and limited concluded LT data.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=179, in-transit=230. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: orders placed P1->arrived P4 (L=3), P3->P4 (L=1), P5->P8 (L=3), P7->P8 (L=1). Average observed lead time = 2.0 (matches promised). Demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean=91.0. I select L via calculate (use observed average lead time) so backend uses empirical lead-time average. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (using observed mean lead time) against holding cost without overfitting to short alternations in arrivals. No single shipment appears permanently lost but lead times are variable; choosing calculate + defaults keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand while letting OR engine cap orders.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Given mixed but roughly close to promised L=2, I set L method=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (uses full-sample mean) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory and uncertain lead-time variability. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments because arrivals have been intermittent but not clearly lost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11. Recent demand samples mean=91 (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). On-hand=18, in-transit=356 \u2014 pipeline substantially exceeds expected (1+L)-period demand. Observed concluded lead times: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P5->P8=3, P7->P8=1, P8->P9=1 (avg=1.8). I set L using calculate to reflect the average observed lead time. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; given large in-transit inventory this will produce minimal or zero net order, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service. This balances high profit per unit against holding cost and acknowledges variable lead times.

Use L='calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand history samples mean = (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91.0. With substantial pipeline and no clear sustained demand regime shift, use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This balances service (large in-transit) and holding cost conservatively while accounting for inferred slightly-below-promised lead time.

For demand and volatility I use 'default' so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leverages all historical demand data, keeps orders conservative given the large in-transit stock, and avoids overreacting to short-term arrival variability or delayed shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but consistently multi-period lead times (observed W sequence: 3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the realized longer-than-promised lead time). Demand samples (105,36,108,110,96) show mean=91; I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, which balances service level (accounts for longer realized L) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed longer and variable: observed lead times = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3], average=2.125; mode=3. Multiple periods show 3-period deliveries, indicating realized lead time often \u22653.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=402. Historical concluded lead times show variability with frequent 3-period deliveries (recent observed lead_times sequence length=8). To reflect the realized longer, variable lead time I set L using recent_N over the last 8 observed lead times. Demand forecast uses default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the backend scales demand for the chosen lead/review horizon; sigma uses default to reflect historical volatility. This balances higher required pipeline for service (capturing longer lead times) while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit holding cost given large in-transit quantity.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (recent observed lead times average >2 and mode=3) and a large recent demand spike (Period 16 demand=229 vs historical mean ~103). To protect service while the backend uses promised lead time, I ask the backend to compute L from observed lead times (calculate) so ordering accounts for the empirically longer/variable lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales demand over (1+L) using all samples, preserving responsiveness to the recent high-demand spike while keeping volatility treatment standard.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent history shows lead times frequently =3 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3, average ~2.1) and volatile demand with a clear upward shift since Period 16. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=439 (large pipeline but arrivals are delayed/variable). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed realized lead time (conservative vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 13-17) to capture the emerging higher-demand regime while retaining some smoothing across the last five samples. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service during longer lead times and higher recent demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive holdings given holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=717. Recent demand has risen (last 5 demands: 119,113,229,243,187; mean \u2248178). Historical conclues show frequent 3-period deliveries and variable lead times. I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect realized deliveries often arriving after 3 periods and to avoid under-ordering given long in-transit. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, higher-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand and reduce stockouts while accepting modest holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20. On-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical arrivals show variable/longer lead times (observed lead times list avg\u22482.125, mode=3) and a clear demand regime shift upward starting Period 12 (demands from P12\u2013P19 = [118,85,119,113,229,243,187,205], regime length=8). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across Periods 12\u201319; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while acknowledging longer, variable lead time so the OR engine orders enough pipeline cover without understating variability.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 16-20: 229,243,187,205,194 \u2192 avg ~211) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=912. Many concluded arrivals show variable/long lead times (multiple 3-period deliveries in history). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (captures realized variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 16-20) because a sustained high-demand regime began at Period 16; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods focus the base-stock on current elevated demand and recent volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 91 (Periods 1-5) to 211 (Periods 16-20), +132% sustained for 5 periods

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show variability with frequent 3-period deliveries and average ~2.125; demand regime shifted up around Period 16 (sustained higher mean ~211). To respect observed longer/variable lead time I use recent_N for L to capture the empirical average of recent observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to target the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 16-20). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the same recent high-demand window. These choices steer the OR engine toward a higher base stock to avoid stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=912 units. Historical concludes show actual lead times often 3 (multiple P arrivals with lead_time=3) and average >2; recent demand since Period 16 is elevated and stable (~208 units/period across P16-22). To protect service against observed 3-period deliveries, set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data (Periods 16-22, N=7) to capture the post-change higher regime; use same recent window for volatility. These parameters make the OR backend raise base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while acknowledging longer realized lead times and avoiding stockouts despite in-transit uncertainty.

To reflect confirmed longer/variable lead times use calculated average lead time. To capture the post-shift higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent demand regime (recent_N with N=8, the regime length from Period_16\u201323). This raises the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to reduce stockouts while trading off holding cost.

I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to measure volatility under the new regime. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while acknowledging longer, variable lead times and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period_26: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (avg ~200+). On-hand=0, in-transit=912 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show frequent 3-period deliveries (mode=3, average \u22482.125) so I treat realized lead time as 3 to protect against late arrivals. Set L explicit=3 to cover longer deliveries. Demand forecast uses recent regime data: use recent_N (N=10, Periods16-25) to capture the sustained high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises base stock to satisfy (1+L) periods of higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; using recent data balances service level versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concludes show persistent long/variable lead times with many 3-period arrivals and a confirmed demand regime shift upward (Periods 16-20 avg ~211). Pipeline (912) likely covers several future periods but some shipments were delayed historically; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand I target the higher recent regime using recent_N=5 (captures the elevated demand periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base stock for the (1+L)-period demand under the new regime while using recent volatility to size safety stock. This balances service vs holding cost given high unit profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent demand regime is higher since Period 16 (sustained ~200+ per period); last 12 demands (P16-P27) avg ~203.7. On-hand=0, in-transit=912 (large pipeline but many past orders showed multi-period arrivals and delays). Concluded lead-time history shows frequent 3-period deliveries (recent observed lead times include many 3s); to reflect realized variability I choose L by averaging recent lead-time observations (recent_N). For demand forecasting I target the post-changepoint regime using recent data (recent_N, N=12) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 12 samples (backend will compute). For sigma_hat I use recent variability over the same 12-sample window (recent_N) so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std over last 12. These settings emphasize service for the higher demand regime while capturing recent lead-time variability and demand volatility; high profit vs low holding cost implies a high service quantile, so using recent high-demand stats reduces stockouts given observed delayed deliveries.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_16 (higher avg demand ~200+). On-hand=0, in-transit=912 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have been variable and often \u22653 in past periods, so use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (Periods 16\u201328) so the OR backend bases base-stock on the current elevated demand and measured volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime) while letting the OR engine cap orders using its cap logic and the large in-transit pipeline to limit over-ordering.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded arrivals show variable/longer lead times (observed avg \u22482.125, frequent 3-period deliveries) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (higher ~200s). To reflect realized lead time variability I request the backend compute actual average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent demand for forecasting: (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201329, N=14) for mu_hat and recent_N (N=14) for sigma_hat so the base-stock and caps reflect elevated demand and pipeline; this also implicitly forces ordering to draw down the large in-transit while protecting service level given delayed arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained elevated weekly demands ~170\u2013243). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=912 (large pipeline covering multiple periods); several past orders showed variable/long lead times including many 3-period arrivals. To reflect observed lead-time variability I select calculate for L (use observed lead-times average). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (Periods 16\u201330) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the new regime. This avoids relying on low historical pre-shift samples and prevents overreacting given the large pipeline \u2014 the OR backend will cap orders via its cap parameter, balancing service level (high profit) against holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32. Recent sustained demand regime since Period_16 (~avg ~211) \u2014 much higher than early-sample mean (\u224891). On-hand=0, in-transit=912 units -> pipeline covers ~4.3 periods at current demand (~210). Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders: P1->P4, P13->P16, P11->P14, P12->P15, etc.) and variable arrivals; promised L=2 underestimates reality. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect observed realized lead time and reduce stockout risk. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 16\u201331) to capture the new high-demand regime for (1+L)-period aggregation. For volatility I also use recent_N N=16 to reflect variability in the recent regime. These choices increase order quantity to meet elevated demand and account for longer actual transit times while letting the OR backend trade off service level vs. holding cost via its base-stock formula.

LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concludes show lead times variable with many 3-period deliveries and average ~2.1; demand jumped at Period_16 and has stayed high (Periods 16-32). I set L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average (captures realized > promised). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (regime from Period_16\u2013Period_32) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=17 captures volatility in this same recent regime. These choices prioritize service under the higher demand and variable/longer lead times while letting the OR engine compute safety stock tradeoffs given profit vs holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times are variable with frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed 3s since Period 4) and several 1\u20132s; demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 16 (recent 5-period mean \u2248220). With large in-transit stock we still must set lead-time to reflect realized longer/variable deliveries so the backend sizes orders appropriately. Chosen L: recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent mix of 1\u20133 day deliveries with emphasis on multiple 3s observed. Chosen mu_hat: recent_N (N=5) to use the most recent high-demand observations (Periods 29\u201333 mean \u2248220) scaled by (1+L) in backend. Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings bias the base-stock upward to protect service during the higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to limit overstock risk given holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. On-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals and average ~2.125 (evidence in conclude messages P4,P8,P12,P14,P15,P16,P17,P25), so use calculated average lead time. Demand shifted up at Period 16 and has remained high through Period 34 (Periods 16-34 form a sustained high-demand regime); use recent_N over that regime (N=19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This balances high service needs (profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock from the recent high-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time average to account for frequent 3-period deliveries and some variability in arrivals.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries and average ~2.125 (observations: [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3]) \u2014 actual lead time often \u2265 promised. Demand regime increased starting Period_16 (sustained higher demand). To capture longer/variable lead time use recent observed lead times (N=8). To target current high-demand regime, set demand forecast using the last 20 periods (regime length \u224820). Use the same recent window for volatility. These settings ensure the OR engine sizes base stock for the elevated demand over the longer effective lead time while accounting for observed variability; pipeline (912) will be offset by the backend order calculation.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period_16 (demands mostly 170\u2013260) and many concluded deliveries with lead times often 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=912 (large pipeline). I set L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures variable/longer realized lead times vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201336 approx.) so forecasts reflect the sustained uplift. sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) uses volatility from the same recent window. These choices prioritize meeting much higher current demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate additional ordering risk.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (carry-over avg\u22482.1, mode=3) so I use recent lead-time evidence rather than the promised 2. Demand shifted up at Period 16 and has remained high; recent windows better represent current demand. I set L as recent_N over the last 8 observed lead times to capture the frequent 3-period outcomes. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 and to size the (1+L)-period forecast appropriately. This increases the base stock to cover the longer effective lead time and higher demand while the capped order rule will limit excessively large single-period orders despite large in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Recent demand has been in the ~180\u2013260 range (sustained post-Period16 regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=912 \u2014 large pipeline but actual lead times have frequently been 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed mode and frequent 3-period deliveries (avoids underordering if promised 2 is wrong). For demand I use recent_N N=20 to capture the post-shift higher-demand regime over the last 20 periods. Volatility is set recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the OR base-stock upward to meet the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap limit orders to control inventory cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (observed sequence [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3], avg\u22482.125) so I use recent lead-time average to capture this. Demand shifted up at Period 16 and recent demand remains at the elevated regime; I use recent_N=5 demand samples to forecast (captures latest variability and mean). These settings make the OR backend target a base-stock sized for the higher recent demand and longer realized lead times, while relying on the large in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering if shipments arrive.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: On-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical conclues confirm lead times often >=3 (many 3-period arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period_16. Recent realized demand (Periods 36-40 = 150,203,181,202,164) averages 180. Because realized lead times have often been 3 and shipments show long in-transit, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime (1+L=4 review+lead window over the most recent 5 periods). This biases orders to cover the elevated, recent demand while accounting for the longer observed lead time and high pipeline; it increases service level to capture demand spikes while holding cost is moderate relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (carry-over records a sustained +132% shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=912 (large pipeline). Promised L=2 but historical concludes show variable lead times; I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (use last 20 periods in that regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent via recent_N=20. This increases service (profit-driven q\u22480.95) while accounting for elevated demand and current large in-transit stock to avoid excessive extra ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: demand has been in the elevated regime (~200s) since Period_16; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=912 (covers many periods). Lead times historically variable with multiple 3-period observations; use observed lead-time average. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect realized variability. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the elevated mean/volatility. This balances profit (high) vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent high demand while letting the backend cap limit excessive ordering given large pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (sustained elevated mean ~211). Observed concluded lead times have been variable with many 3-period deliveries (carry-over showed avg ~2.125, mode=3) and there are large in-transit units (912) but on-hand=0. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times (captures the realized >2 behavior). For demand I use recent_N N=20 (the most recent 28-period high-demand regime capped to 20) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 20 samples \u2014 this biases orders to the new, higher demand. For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the sustained high-demand regime while the calculated L acknowledges longer/variable lead times and helps avoid stockouts despite in-transit uncertainty.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (mode=3, avg~2.125) and many delayed arrivals; therefore set L explicitly to 3 to hedge against longer realizations. Demand has been in a higher regime (~200+ per period since Period_16); to capture the current sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the recent 20 periods of observed demand. This increases order quantities to satisfy service while acknowledging higher holding cost via tighter recent-sample volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (recent observed sequence length 8 with mean ~2.125, mode=3) so I set L by averaging the last 8 observed lead times to reflect realized variability. Demand has been in the elevated regime for many periods; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine forecasts using the most recent demand level/volatility while accounting for the longer recent lead times. This keeps service high given large pipeline and elevated demand, without overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Observed lead times historically variable with many 3-period deliveries; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime in recent periods (reduces influence of early low-demand samples). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat for the high regime) while recognizing large existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show variability with frequent 3-period deliveries (carry-over shows avg\u22482.125, mode=3). Demand regime has been higher since Period 16 (carry-over: avg increased to ~211 sustained). To respect observed longer/variable lead time, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend averages actuals. For demand, use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime to capture current mean and variance; choose N=20 (regime length >20, cap at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent high-demand behavior and avoid understocking. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by targeting service for the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit (912) will reduce immediate order amounts computed by the OR engine.

To reflect observed lead-time variability use calculate (average observed lead times). For demand, focus on the post-shift high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent stable regime while capping at 20). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings aim to raise the base-stock for higher demand while accounting for observed longer lead times and leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 50. On-hand=0, in-transit=912. Historical concluded lead times show variability with many 3-period deliveries (user carry-over notes avg~2.125); demand regime shifted higher earlier (mean of provided samples=91 pre-shift). Given confirmed variable/longer lead times, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the backend scales demand (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances higher target base-stock to cover extended pipeline while relying on full-sample demand stats; large in-transit (912) will reduce immediate ordering via pipeline subtraction. No new lost-shipment conclusion in latest period data.
