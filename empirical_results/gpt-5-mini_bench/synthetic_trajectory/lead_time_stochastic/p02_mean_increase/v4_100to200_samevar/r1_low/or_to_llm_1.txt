  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over shows actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P4 and others). Therefore required coverage = (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Demand outlook: sustained high regime since Period 16 (avg \u2248208 units/period per carry-over insight). Required coverage = 4 \xd7 208 \u2248 832 units. Inventory position: on-hand 0 + in-transit 880 = 880 units, which exceeds required coverage and provides a small buffer (~48 units). OR recommended 0 (its base-stock/cap logic given promised L would also cap orders). Risks: orders can be lost or arrive late, but no new concluded evidence of additional lost shipments since recent in-transit is large and several prior orders have concluded validating L=3. Holding vs. stockout tradeoff: profit = holding cost ($1 vs $1) \u2192 critical fractile 0.5, so no extra safety stock implied beyond demand mean; ordering more would raise holding cost with no expected profit gain. Action: place 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while current pipeline already covers ~4 periods of demand under the confirmed high-demand regime.",
