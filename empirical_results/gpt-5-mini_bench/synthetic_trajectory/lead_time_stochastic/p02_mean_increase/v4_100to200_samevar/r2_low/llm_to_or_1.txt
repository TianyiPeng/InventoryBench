Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and demand priors from all historical samples (Periods 1\u20135) since no sustained regime change is evident. Selecting default for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost with no additional ad hoc adjustments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: no concluded arrivals yet (Period_1 order arrived=0 is expected given promised L=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=143. Historical demand mean=91 (samples:105,36,108,110,96). No sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence. Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand stats so backend sets base-stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample; this balances service vs holding cost without overreacting to a single delayed/expected arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=269 (orders from P1+P2), no concluded arrivals yet. No evidence of changed lead time or sustained demand shift (only two recent concludes with no arrivals visible yet). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates based on full sample history: L kept as default (promised=2) so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the OR engine conservative given the large in-transit pipeline and lack of confirmed arrival/lead-time changes.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent concluded periods show no arrivals (Period1-3 arrived=0 for orders), so actual lead time is unconfirmed; in-transit=285 may include delayed shipments. Demand samples available show moderate volatility. To avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays, use promised lead time and default demand estimates: let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=4, arrived=143 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 3 periods), 16 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 1 periods), starting on-hand inventory=159, demand=86, sold=86, ending on-hand inventory=73
Daily Profit: $86.00, Daily Holding Cost: $73.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start. On-hand=73, in-transit=130. History shows arrivals in Period_4: order from P1 arrived with lead_time=3; order from P3 arrived with lead_time=1; order from P2 (126) has not concluded and appears overdue/possibly lost. Observed lead times = {3,1} with average 2, so I let the backend compute an L based on observed data. Demand history mean is 91 units/period; I use default demand/volatility methods ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine can compute base-stock and the capped order given the inferred L. This balances service (use observed average lead time) versus holding cost while flagging missing shipment risk for monitoring.

Daily Profit: $55.00, Daily Holding Cost: $18.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_6. On-hand=18, in-transit=268. Historical demand samples (periods 1-5) mean = (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91.0. Observed lead times from concluded messages: one order (P1\u2192P4) had lead_time=3; one (P3\u2192P4) had lead_time=1 \u2014 variability exists, so use the calculated average lead time to let the backend smooth this. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps the policy grounded in full-sample demand while adapting lead time from observed arrivals, balancing service level (profit=holding) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrivals show mixed lead times (one order: P1\u2192P4 => LT=3; one order: P3\u2192P4 => LT=1). Promised LT=2 but recent evidence is variable; I use recent_N (N=2) to let backend average the two observed lead times. Demand history (Periods 1\u20135: mean=91) shows no sustained regime shift, so use default demand estimators: mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This balances service (using recent observed lead times) against holding cost given on-hand=0 and 347 in-transit that may include delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Observed concluded lead times: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1, P4->P7 = 3 \u2192 average observed lead time = 2.33. Several shipments experienced multi-period delays (two 3-period observations) so I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand samples available (5 samples) used by default forecasting; no clear sustained demand regime change detected, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine set base stock while accounting for higher implied lead time. This balances service (higher L increases coverage) vs holding cost conservatively given delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-53.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=109, in-transit=214. Historical demand samples mean=91, std\u224827.9. Concluded arrivals show variable but on-average-longer lead times (observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 avg\u22482.2). I choose L via "calculate" to let backend use observed lead times average. mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level (protect vs. observed longer lead times) against holding cost; current pipeline (323) already roughly matches the implied coverage, so defaults suffice.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: 3,1,3,3,1 (avg\u22482.2) \u2014 evidence of lead-time longer than promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 start. Recent concluded lead-times = [3,1,3,3,1] (avg\u22482.2) suggesting actual lead-time slightly > promised 2. On-hand=14, in-transit=249 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been delayed historically. Demand history (5 samples) mean=91. I choose L using recent_N (N=5) to let backend infer average observed lead time rather than trusting promised. For demand and volatility I use default (all-sample) estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all, leveraging full sample set; this balances service level given elevated inferred lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term spikes. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand considering the longer inferred lead time and the high pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=320. Historical concluded lead times show variability with multiple 3-period arrivals and some 1-period arrivals (observed sequence: 3,1,3,3,1; avg \u22482.2), indicating actual lead time is longer and variable versus promised=2. Demand samples (periods 1\u20135) have mean=91. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized longer lead time). For demand and volatility I choose 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level (accounts for longer calculated L) while using full-sample demand stats given no confirmed recent demand regime shift. This approach helps ensure pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand despite delayed arrivals and avoids overreacting to short noisy swings.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=339. Historical concluded lead times show variability with multiple 3-period arrivals (observed sequence avg\u22482.2) indicating actual lead time likely exceeds promised 2. I therefore let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method='calculate') so L reflects realized delays. For demand I use default formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with the chosen L; this balances higher safety stock for the longer realized lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats. The large in-transit (339) reduces immediate ordering urgency; using calculate+default lets OR cap orders appropriately given pipeline and the longer inferred lead time.

Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=224. Historical concluded lead times = {3,1,3,3,1} (avg\u22482.2) indicating actual lead time > promised 2 and some shipments delayed. I set L using 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (uses full sample set 105,36,108,110,96). This lets the optimizer raise target pipeline to cover the longer realized lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats given limited data and intermittent arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=342. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average \u22482.2 with samples {3,1,3,3,1} \u2014 evidence actual LT > promised 2. To reflect this, set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed average LT. Demand samples (105,36,108,110,96) are limited and show no sustained demand regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This lets the OR engine size orders to cover the review+lead horizon given inferred longer LT while relying on observed demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times (Periods history) average \u22482.2, indicating realized lead time > promised 2. I choose to let backend compute L from observed lead times to reflect the longer realized lead time (method=calculate). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend will scale demand mean/variance by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given in-transit stock and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5) to balance service level vs holding cost. No new sustained regime change beyond previously noted lead-time evidence.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=344. Historical demands mean = (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91.0. Concluded lead-time observations show variability (some 3-period arrivals, some 1); to let backend incorporate observed lead-time history I select L via 'calculate' (average observed lead times). Given large in-transit stock and no strong recent demand regime change, use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using observed longer average lead time) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise or potential lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent demand has been high and variable with multiple stockouts (on-hand=0) and large demands (e.g., Period 16 demand=229). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 units (pipeline significant but arrivals have been delayed historically). Concluded arrivals show repeated lead times of 3 periods (many orders arriving 3 periods after order), so I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. To reflect ongoing uncertainty and to let OR backend size orders for the longer effective lead time, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will scale demand mean and std by 1+L). This balances service level (capturing longer lead time) versus holding cost by delegating exact safety-stock quantile to OR using profit/holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16 \u2014 six orders with 3-period lead_time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=368. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times; to avoid stockouts I set L explicit=3. Given limited, non-sustained recent spike evidence (only two very high-demand periods), I retain default demand estimates based on all samples to avoid overreacting: mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This increases pipeline coverage for the longer confirmed lead time while avoiding excess holding given Profit=Holding.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand has stepped up (periods 14-18: 119,113,229,243,187) and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=3. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (covering much of the multi-period demand but uncertain due to delayed arrivals). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands to raise base-stock for longer lead time and recent spike). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility from the same recent window. These choices boost target inventory to protect service level given longer lead time and recent demand surge while the OR backend will cap orders per its cap.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 20. On-hand=0, in-transit=709. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations through Period 18). Recent periods (P15\u2013P19) show a sustained demand surge (113,229,243,187,205) versus earlier low-middle values\u2014thus use a lead time of 3 and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. Chosen methods: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean and volatility (use last 5 periods P15\u2013P19). This increases base_stock to cover longer transit and higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N lets the OR backend size safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost given higher observed variability. No overdue shipments need immediate special handling because in-transit=709 provides coverage but parameters ensure future orders account for L=3 and elevated demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21. On-hand=0, in-transit=782 \u2014 substantial pipeline but observed concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations in history). Recent demand (Periods 12\u201320) shows a sustained higher regime vs. early samples (9 periods, mean \u2248165.9). To protect service during the confirmed longer lead time and higher recent demand, set L explicitly to 3 and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the recent 9-period regime so the OR backend sizes orders for (1+L) periods of elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 3 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16). Recent demand since ~Period 12 has shifted to a higher regime (many periods with demand 100\u2013243 vs earlier ~80\u2013120). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 782 (large pipeline). To ensure the OR engine covers the longer confirmed transit and captures the higher recent demand level, I set L explicitly to 3 and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent data (recent_N=10) to reflect the elevated mean and volatility. This increases target base-stock to maintain service while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=782. History of concluded arrivals shows persistent 3-period lead times since Period 17; recent demand (Periods 16-22) is materially higher than earlier periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend confirms the 3-period reality. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 16-22) so the base-stock covers (1+L) review+lead demand under the elevated mean and volatility, reducing stockouts while limiting extra holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=709. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirms actual L=3). Demand shifted up at Period 16 (post-shift mean \u2248208). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 16-23) to capture the new high-demand regime; mu_hat will thus cover (1+L)\xd7mean of those 8 recent samples (~4\xd7208). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets the higher service level needed for the sustained demand increase while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time; with in-transit=709 vs mu_hat\u2248832.5 we should still trigger replenishment to cover the 4-period demand horizon.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. Recent history shows a sustained regime shift to higher demand from Period 16 (avg ~208) and multiple concluded arrivals confirming actual lead time = 3 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=833 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to match confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 18\u201324) to capture the post-shift demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent variation; mu_hat will therefore reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of those 7 most recent demands. For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand scatter. This balances service (longer actual lead time) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=833. Historical concluded arrivals confirm sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations). Demand regime shifted up at Period 16; recent periods (P16\u2013P25) average demand \u2248202.5 units/period. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time (promised=2 is stale). For mu_hat I use an explicit (1+L)-period demand forecast: (1+3)*202.5 = 810.0 to cover review+lead demand given higher recent demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture volatility from the last 10 periods (P16\u2013P25). These choices push the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given the confirmed longer lead time and sustained higher demand, while sigma recent_N gives a realistic variability estimate for safety stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_16 (avg ~208 P16-22) and multiple concluded arrivals confirming lead time=3. On-hand=0, in-transit=833 \u2014 pipeline large but subject to 3-period arrivals. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid underordering. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 16\u201326 regime length \u224811) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples, capturing the new high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service under the sustained higher demand and account for the longer confirmed lead time and missing/late arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (avg \u2248208 vs 96 before); on-hand=0, in-transit=833 (many outstanding shipments). Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 \u2014 use explicit L=3 to reflect reality and avoid under-ordering. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the 12 periods since the regime shift (Periods 16\u201327), capturing the new higher mean and volatility so the OR backend sets a base-stock appropriate to current demand and 3-period lead time.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29: demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (~avg ~208) and lead times have been observed consistently as 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=833 (covers expected multi-period demand). Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 16\u201328 length=13) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N N=13 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility in the high-demand regime. These choices align pipeline coverage with the longer confirmed lead time and prioritize service during the sustained demand uplift while letting the backend compute safety stock from recent mean/variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period 16 (many periods of 170\u2013243; avg \u2248208 for P16\u2013P22). Observed concluded arrivals consistently show 3-period actual lead time (multiple P\u2192P+3 matches). On-hand=0, in-transit=833 (large pipeline but lead time is 3). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the backend forecasts over the correct replenishment horizon. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (periods since the regime shift, P16\u2013P29) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=14 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts under longer lead time and higher demand) while letting the OR cap limit excessive ordering given holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirmations). Demand increased sharply starting at Period 16 and has remained higher through Period 30 (sustained regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=833 \u2014 with L=3 we must cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (periods 16\u201330) to base forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime, improving service while avoiding excess holding under the new regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher demand ~200+). Concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 3 periods, so I set L explicitly to 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=833 which covers ~4 periods of the higher demand regime (833 / ~208 \u22484) so we have substantial pipeline but still must plan with L=3. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=16, periods 16\u201331) to reflect the post-changepoint demand mean/volatility across the review+lead horizon (1+L periods =4 periods). These settings align the OR base-stock calculation with confirmed longer lead time and the higher recent demand, reducing stockouts while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (avg ~208 vs ~96 prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=833 \u2014 this roughly equals (1+L)*avg_recent_demand (4\xd7208=832) so pipeline currently adequate but timing matters. Observed concluded lead times repeatedly = 3; use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=17 covering Period16\u201332) to base forecast and volatility on the sustained higher-demand regime so the OR engine sizes base stock to meet the new demand and avoids over-relying on older low-demand history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Historical concluded lead-times consistently show 3 periods (multiple confirmations from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16 and later), so use L=3. Demand shifted up at Period 16 (avg before \u224896, after \u2248208); recent regime from P16 onward is sustained (~18 periods). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility over the current regime. This increases target base_stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time and higher demand while the capped order will limit excess inventory given holding cost equals profit.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=834. History shows sustained lead-time=3 (multiple concluded arrivals P\u2192P+3) and a demand regime shift at Period 16 (avg before \u224896, after \u2248208). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times (captures confirmed LT=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (periods 16\u201334) to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=19 to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the elevated demand and accounts for longer actual lead time and current pipeline to avoid stockouts while controlling holding costs.

Demand shifted up at Period 16; recent periods (P16-P35) show consistently higher demand (~208 avg). Choose L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base demand forecast and volatility on the post-shift high-demand regime (use last 20 samples since the regime runs P16\u2013P35). These settings align the OR base-stock calculation with confirmed lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, balancing service level and holding cost given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=833. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, etc.). Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 (avg \u2248208 since), so use recent demand to forecast. Set L explicitly to 3 to match observed lead time and avoid underordering. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (captures the post-Period-16 high-demand regime; N capped at 20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Current Period 38. On-hand=0, in-transit=833 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=3 (multiple confirmations). Demand shifted up around Period 16 to a higher regime (avg \u2248208). To reflect confirmed longer lead time and the sustained higher demand, I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime. Volatility will also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher sustained demand while accounting for the longer 3-period transit time and the large in-transit pipeline.

To align ordering with true arrival delays and recent high-demand regime, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods of the sustained high-demand regime, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=833. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16). Demand shifted up at Period 16 to a higher regime (~200s); recent demand (Periods 20-39) remains in this elevated regime. To protect service with the longer observed lead time while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 20 high-demand samples, reflecting the sustained elevated regime and higher variability.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: recent demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 16 (many periods of ~170\u2013260). On-hand=0, in-transit=833 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=3 periods; use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-change high-demand regime (most recent 20 samples since the shift) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 20). For volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to reflect current variability. These choices align order coverage with the confirmed longer lead time and recent high demand while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and capped order quantity; large in-transit reduces new order sizes.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals); promised=2 but evidence strong. Demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~96 to ~208 and has persisted; use recent regime data. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid stocking short. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 (most recent 20 periods within the high-demand regime) to capture current mean across review+lead. Use sigma recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand, prioritizing service given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=833. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed observations since Period 17). Demand shifted up at Period 16 and has remained elevated; to capture the current high-demand regime I use the recent regime's statistics. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality (promised 2 is stale). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demand samples (covers the post-changepoint regime and balances responsiveness vs. noise). These choices align the OR backend's base-stock calculation with the confirmed longer lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, improving service while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock beyond recent volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand since Period_16 is persistently higher (~~200/unit) vs early-period ~96; concluded lead-time history repeatedly shows 3-period arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=833 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period_16 and to avoid diluting with early low-demand samples. Sigma set to recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=833. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time since Period_17; promised=2 but evidence strongly supports L=3. Demand regime shifted up around Period_16 (avg P1-15 ~96 vs P16-44 ~~205); recent periods remain in the high regime. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering given long transit. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the sustained high-demand regime since Period_16, N capped at 20) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to target appropriate base stock while balancing holding cost with the higher demand and confirmed longer lead time. This leverages the large in-transit volume (833) to avoid excessive additional orders while ensuring coverage for the 4-period review+lead demand window implied by L=3.

To cover the longer confirmed lead time I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-shift high-demand regime (most recent 20 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current higher mean and recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=833 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals strongly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting at Period_16. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time (promised=2 but multiple concluded orders show 3). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint/high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of recent high-demand samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets safety stock appropriate for the longer confirmed lead time and higher recent demand while the large in-transit quantity will limit immediate additional ordering via the engine cap.

Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=833. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (post-shift avg \u2248208). To ensure pipeline covers the longer true lead time, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent data from the post-shift regime: choose recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent 20 periods since the shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime. This balances service (higher base stock for higher demand and longer lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging past missing/delayed shipments by using explicit L=3.

LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=833. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift up around Period 16 (higher mean since P16). To align the OR engine with observed 3-period lead time and the higher recent demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3 and base demand and volatility on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures post-shift behavior while smoothing short noise). This ensures pipeline targets cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand, reducing stockouts while controlling holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Demand shifted up at Period_16 (avg \u2248208); use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility. Large pipeline reduces urgency of immediate orders but parameters aim to match longer lead time and higher demand to balance service vs holding cost.
