Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=828. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift at Period 16 to ~205 units/period (Periods 16\u201321 and sustained high demand since). That implies we must cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand because orders placed now arrive after 3 periods and current-period demand occurs after decision. Estimated demand per period \u2248200 (recent periods mostly 160\u2013260, regime ~205). Required pipeline to cover 4 periods \u2248 4\xd7200 = 800 units. Current pipeline (in-transit=828) already exceeds that target, so no new order is needed now. Ordering 0 avoids holding cost ($1/unit/period) on any additional inventory while maintaining coverage for the next four periods given current pipeline. Risk notes: in-transit is aggregated and some shipments may be lost or arrive unevenly; monitor conclude messages next periods and order if arrivals are missing or regime intensifies. Final decision: order 0 units.",
