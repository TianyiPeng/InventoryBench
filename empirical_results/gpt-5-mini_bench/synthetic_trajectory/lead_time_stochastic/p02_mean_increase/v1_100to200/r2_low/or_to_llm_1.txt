Given the uncertainty about whether in-transit will ever conclude, ordering now risks increasing holding cost if those in-transit units do arrive; conversely, not ordering risks stockout only if those 300 are lost. With no concluded arrivals yet and only two periods of non-arrival (insufficient to conclusively label shipments lost per carry-over rules), the prudent action is to wait and not place new orders this period (order 0) to avoid unnecessary holding cost.

  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=892. Recent demand (Periods 14\u201349) averaged \u2248200 units/period (sustained high-regime). Promised L=2 but earlier concluded history confirms actual lead time has often been 3 (Periods 1\u21924, 5\u21928, 40\u219243). Decision rule: ensure pipeline + on-hand covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Required coverage \u22483\xd7200=600 units. Current pipeline 892 > 600 so no replenishment needed and placing an order risks unnecessary holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit=$1). OR recommends 0; I concur. Action: order 0 units.",
