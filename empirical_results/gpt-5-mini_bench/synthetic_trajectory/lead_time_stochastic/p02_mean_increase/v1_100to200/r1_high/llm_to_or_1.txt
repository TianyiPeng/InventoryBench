Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) with default aggregations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This is conservative given no evidence of demand or lead-time regime change and balances service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: demand history for chips(Regular) shows samples [141,118,67,94,89]. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (ordered P1) which has not concluded as arrived \u2014 no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given no confirmed regime or lead-time change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=292. No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed earlier may still be en route), so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand stats to let the OR engine compute base-stock given its priors. Historical sample mean = 101.8 units/period, so (1+L)*mean \u2248 305.4 \u2014 in-transit (292) is slightly below that target, so default parameters will prompt ordering to restore pipeline while balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=388. History shows orders placed in P1 (149), P2 (143), P3 (96) all arrived=0 at their conclude messages \u2014 no arrivals observed for three consecutive concludes. This indicates lead time is longer than the promised 2 (likely \u22653) or shipments lost; to be conservative I set explicit L=3 so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. Demand shows a recent downward shift (samples: 141,118,67,94,89); I use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (last 3 samples 67,94,89) so forecasts and variability reflect the lower recent demand and avoid overstock given holding cost. These settings help the backend raise the planned pipeline for longer delays while scaling mean and volatility to recent lower demand, balancing service vs. holding cost given possible lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >=3 periods: orders placed P1 (149), P2 (143), P3 (96) all showed arrived=0 at their conclude messages, indicating sustained delay or loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2115.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_5. Context: on-hand=127, in-transit=267. History shows mixed actual lead times: observed arrivals indicate at least one order had lead_time=3 (P1\u2192arrived in P4) and one had lead_time=1 (P3\u2192arrived in P4); several earlier conclude messages showed arrived=0 for P1\u2013P3 suggesting delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative I set L via 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the 3-period event). Demand history (Periods 1\u20135) will be handled with default aggregation ((1+L)*mean) to avoid overfitting to short noisy sample; sigma uses default to reflect full-sample volatility. These choices balance service (guarding against the confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full-sample demand stats while accounting for the inferred lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1993.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=21, in-transit=378. Concluded history shows an order placed on P1 arrived on P4 (lead_time=3); multiple earlier missing arrivals suggest variability but P1->P4 confirms longer lead time. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrival timing so the OR engine sizes orders over the correct pipeline horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; with large in-transit inventory the capped ordering will avoid overordering while preserving service level under the longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent concludes show erratic demand with confirmed lead-time shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=479; several earlier orders were delayed and lead_time has been confirmed as 3 periods (order P1\u2192arrived P4). To account for the now-confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (robust to limited data) while the explicit L forces ordering to cover the longer 4-period pipeline and mitigates lost/delayed shipment risk vs holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1596.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=38, in-transit=373. Historical concludes show mixed but persistent 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7) with one 1-period event (P3->P4); this suggests actual lead time \u22482.33. Several earlier orders were delayed/lost before P4, so I keep demand forecast simple and let the OR engine scale with inferred L. I choose L='calculate' to use the average of observed lead times, and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead times and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=64, in-transit=322. Historical arrivals show sustained 3-period actual lead time (P1 arrived in P4; P4\u2192P7; P5\u2192P8), and several earlier orders were delayed/lost relative to promised L=2. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality so the OR engine sizes pipeline for the longer delay. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (samples mean=101.8), which increases base-stock and safety stock to protect service given the longer lead time and existing in-transit mass while controlling holding costs.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=44, in-transit=344. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead time observations (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) with intermittent 1-period arrivals; shipments have been delayed/lost earlier. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained pattern of 3-period arrivals so the OR engine plans for longer pipeline. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative replenishment level (covers 4 periods demand) and higher safety stock to balance high profit vs low holding cost given delayed shipments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_11. Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times but multiple confirmations of 3-period deliveries (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8), suggesting longer-than-promised lead-time behavior. On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (coverage across future periods). I choose to let the backend infer an effective L from observed arrivals (method: calculate) so the model accounts for the realized lead-time distribution. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use the backend defaults (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples are applied; this balances service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and limited recent demand sample size. No new lost-shipment insight beyond prior confirmations.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=467. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and several 1-periods; average observed lead time \u22482. Using 'calculate' lets backend compute average observed lead time from concluded history. Demand samples mean=101.8; with L determined by observed average, I pick default demand/volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (captures observed longer lead times) while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy 1-period arrivals. Current pipeline (467) will be reconciled by OR engine against the computed base stock.

Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) confirming actual lead time = 3 and earlier delays/lost shipments. I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR backend sizes pipeline for the longer realized lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level over the 4-period demand window against holding cost given profit/holding rates.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14. On-hand=0, in-transit=377. Historical concluces show repeated 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) \u2014 actual lead time is best-estimated as 3. Recent demand has been elevated/variable; I use the most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313: 98,137,86,87,118) to set forecast and volatility so the OR backend reacts to the current regime. With L=3, using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current demand level (maintaining service while limiting holding cost). Current pipeline (~377) is slightly below (1+L)*recent_mean, so these settings will prompt replenishment to restore cover for the 4-period demand window.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=465; recent demand has been ~elevated and stable over the last 5 periods (P10\u2013P14: 137,86,87,118,111; mean\u2248107.8). Historical concludes show multiple 3-period lead-time observations (several 3s) but some variability (1s and a 2), so use the data-driven average for L. Set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime and avoid diluting the recent higher demand with older samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/inconsistent lead times and large in-transit) against holding cost by focusing forecast on the recent demand level.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (orders: P1\u2192arrived P4, P9\u2192arrived P12, P11\u2192arrived P14). On-hand=0, in-transit=465 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed by 3. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show baseline demand; to align OR backend with observed lead time I set L=3 explicitly so mu_hat/sigma_hat defaults scale by (1+L). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead times and current large pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16), plus some 1\u20132 period events; average observed lead time is higher than the promised 2. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand has recent volatility (notably Period_16 spike to 273) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 demand periods when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 this raises target base stock to protect service given the in-transit inventory and recent demand jump while keeping variability localized to recent behavior. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments here; choosing recent estimates balances service level vs. holding cost given current pipeline of 378 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2546.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent history and conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time 3). Demand samples (provided) have mean 101.8 units/period; with L=3 the review+lead horizon is 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 units \u2014 pipeline alone currently covers ~5 periods at historical mean, so we can avoid aggressive replenishment. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead-time (prevents underordering given delayed arrivals). I set mu_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 4\xd7mean, matching the confirmed 4-period demand horizon. I set sigma_hat to default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to capture scaled demand variability. These choices align OR safety stock to the longer realized lead time while avoiding unnecessary extra orders since in-transit inventory is already ample.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders repeatedly arrived with 3-period lag and earlier carry-over noted). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime in the last 3 periods (Period_16=273, Period_17=170, Period_18=232) so I use a recent-3 forecast to capture current elevated mean and volatility. Set L explicit=3 to match observed arrivals so the OR backend sizes pipeline correctly; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make base-stock responsive to the new higher-demand regime while controlling holding cost risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=907. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, etc.), so actual lead time is sustained at 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR engine sizes orders for the longer observed pipeline. Given no strong recent demand regime shift in the provided sample set, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances higher safety stock from longer lead time against holding cost while leveraging observed demand history and large in-transit volume.

To ensure orders cover the longer observed pipeline delays, set lead time explicitly to 3.

Concluded arrivals history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4 etc.), so use L=3 to reflect realized delays. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=8) to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 16\u201323) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of these 8 recent samples (~4\xd7188.9). Pipeline (907) exceeds that 4-period demand estimate (~756), so no urgent extra safety is required; using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) captures recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods. To cover the (1+L)=4-period demand and react to the recent high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)*recent mean, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This prioritizes service during the sustained demand increase while keeping holding cost awareness via recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclues show confirmed lead time = 3 periods (orders placed P1 arrived P4 etc.), and demand shifted up starting Period_16. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering from promised 2. For demand, use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods16-25 avg ~189.4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19) while containing holding cost by using recent-regime stats and correct lead time to size pipeline appropriately.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1 arrived in P4 and multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 16 (higher mean in P16\u2013P26). To account for confirmed lead-time delays and the sustained higher-demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=11, Periods 16\u201326) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using the current high-demand regime. This balances service (capture elevated demand) while recognizing long lead times and pipeline on-hand/in-transit exposure.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. History shows a sustained lead-time of 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3) and a clear demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201327, 12 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the new regime while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and prevents underordering.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 16 (post-shift demands ~160-203). Set L explicit=3 to match observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering given lost/delayed history. For demand, use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 16-28) to target the post-shift regime when computing (1+L)*mean for mu_hat. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service for the higher-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap formula.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand is in the higher regime (Periods 16-29 avg \u2248189); on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 (orders repeatedly arrived after 3 periods or were delayed), so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid underordering. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 16-29) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses the same recent window (N=14) to reflect current volatility. This combination prioritizes service (higher mu_hat for the new regime) while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and reduces stockouts from assuming the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 31. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals show 3-period lag). Demand shifted up at Period 16 and recent periods (16-30) reflect the new regime; use recent-demand estimates to capture higher mean/volatility. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (Periods 16-30) so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand under the current high-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher demand). Pipeline (910) covers several periods of demand but arrivals are delayed by confirmed 3-period lead time; no evidence of new lost shipments recently. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend plans across the correct replenishment delay. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the post-regime higher-demand behavior (Periods 16\u201331) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean over the review+lead period. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=16) so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices align order targets with the confirmed longer lead time and recent higher demand, balancing service (profit) vs holding cost given ample in-transit stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33. On-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historic concludes confirm actual lead time ~3 periods (multiple P1,P4,P5,P9,P13,P14 arrivals). Many recent periods (P16-P32) show elevated demand vs earlier regime. I set L by calculating average observed lead times to capture the confirmed longer lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=17) to forecast across review+lead using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16-32) where demand is consistently higher. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=17) to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices ensure the OR engine targets service under confirmed longer lead times and higher recent demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the backend cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods by concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=910; use L=3 to reflect observed reality. Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has persisted; therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=18 (Periods 16\u201333) to capture the current higher mean across the review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=18 to capture current volatility. These choices align the OR backend forecast with confirmed longer lead time and sustained higher demand, balancing service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 35: confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods from concluded history; demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (sustained). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 910 (pipeline present but arrivals observed with 3-period lag historically). To ensure the OR backend plans for the confirmed longer lead time and uses full sample history for demand statistics, set L explicitly to 3 and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (accounting for longer lead time) versus holding cost by letting backend compute the target base stock and apply its cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: recent demand has been in the elevated regime since Period_16 (high 180\u2013227 range). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (periods 16\u201335) so the forecast and volatility focus on the new, higher-demand regime. This increases the backend base-stock to improve service under longer real lead time while relying on recent samples to avoid underforecasting; using recent volatility captures current demand uncertainty and limits excessive safety stock given holding cost.

To reflect the confirmed longer lead time I set L via calculate (use observed lead times). To capture the post-Period_16 higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the new regime and current volatility). This raises base-stock to improve service while sigma reflects higher variability.

Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 and recent periods (16\u201338) show consistently higher demand. I set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L) forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (20 most recent concluded samples) and similarly set sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This prioritizes service during the sustained higher-demand regime while the calculated L accounts for prolonged lead times/in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (~180\u2013230 range). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline). Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-Period-16 high-demand regime (regime length ~24 periods; capped N=20). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage with the (1+L) review+lead window and prioritize service given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=910 (many shipments outstanding/overdue). Historical concluded messages show mixed lead times (1\u20133); average observed lead time is ~2.18. To let the OR engine adapt to observed variability in arrivals, I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16; I therefore use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the long-run demand signal while letting L adjust the review+lead horizon. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty and elevated demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, etc.). Recent demand (Periods 37-41 = 182,203,228,195,260) shows sustained high regime since Period_16. To reflect confirmed LT=3 and current high recent demand, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap around the most recent high-demand regime and recent volatility, while accounting for the longer actual lead time and mitigating missing-shipment risk given large in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show a mix of lead times (many 3-period observations plus some 1-2), and earlier analysis confirmed a sustained lead-time change to ~3. Demand history shows a clear higher-demand regime since Period_16 (avg rise ~+88%). On-hand is 0 with 957 units in-transit (many outstanding long-delayed shipments). To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time dispersion while leveraging its internal averaging, set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, capturing the higher post-Period_16 demand regime already present in history. This balances service (higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=957 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 4,7,8,12,16,17, etc.) show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods; many recent periods exhibit the higher-demand regime that began at Period 16. To account for the confirmed longer lead time and the sustained higher demand, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint/high-demand regime in the most recent observations so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=20) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices push the backend to stock for the 1+L review+lead horizon under the higher demand regime while recognizing pipeline inventory already in transit.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=957. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P13\u2192P16, etc.). Demand shifted up at Period_16 and the recent high-demand regime runs through Period_44 (29 periods). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent high-demand regime without overfitting) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 demands. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine sizes base stock for the longer realized lead time and elevated demand while using recent data to balance service level versus holding cost given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand jumped at Period_16 and has stayed at a higher regime; to capture the current regime and recent volatility I use recent data. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and ensure pipeline coverage. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods of the higher-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: recent demand is in the high regime established at Period_16 (mean jumped ~+88%). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times show mostly 3-period arrivals with some 1s/2s; average observed lead time ~2.31. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (the post-changepoint regime is long; use the last 20 samples to reflect the sustained higher demand). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 to capture recent demand variability. These choices align mu_hat/sigma_hat with the confirmed higher-demand regime while L from historical observations captures the longer/variable lead time; together they balance service versus holding costs given large in-transit stock.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclude messages show confirmed lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift at Period 16 (higher demand since). To ensure pipeline covers the true arrival behavior, I set lead time explicitly to 3. Recent demand (Periods 43\u201347) is representative of current regime, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) against holding cost while accounting for delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period_49: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=915 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time and avoid underordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period_16 high-demand regime (use most recent 20 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Volatility also uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals so the OR backend won't understock.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=915. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3), and demand has been higher since Period_16 (~180-260 range). Many past promised-2 shipments actually arrived after 3 periods, so I set lead time to 3. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent demand statistics (most recent 20 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts across the review+lead window using up-to-date mean and volatility. This balances service (capture elevated demand) while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess inventory given large in-transit volume.
