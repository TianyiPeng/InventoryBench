{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: history and provided carry-over confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Therefore planning horizon = L+1 = 4 periods (current period demand occurs after decision). Demand outlook: carry-over reports a sustained regime shift since Period 30 with avg \u2248200 units/period (P30\u2013P37 = 200.4). Inventory check: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 802 units. Required coverage for 4 periods \u2248 4 \xd7 200 \u2248 800 units. Pipeline (802) already \u2248 covers 4 periods of elevated demand, so additional ordering is unnecessary and risks extra holding cost. OR recommended 0 units; I agree based on confirmed lead time and pipeline sufficiency. Final strategy: place 0 units this period to avoid overstock while awaiting the in-transit shipment(s) to arrive and be observed in future conclude messages. Monitor arrivals next periods to detect any lost shipments or further demand shifts and revise if pipeline falls below 4-period coverage.",
