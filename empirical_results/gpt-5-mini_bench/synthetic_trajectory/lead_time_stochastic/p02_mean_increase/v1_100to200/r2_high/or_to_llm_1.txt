Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 467 units. With L=3, decisions must cover current period plus next 3 periods (4 periods total) because arrivals won't help until after 3 periods.

Four-period demand at that recent rate \u2248 552 units, so pipeline (467) is somewhat short (~85 units). However, many in-transit units are already outstanding from multiple past orders and will likely arrive staggered; ordering now would arrive after 3 periods and may worsen holding costs if demand subsides. Profit per unit ($19) is high relative to holding cost ($1/period), but given substantial pipeline and uncertain arrival timing variability (lead time has shown occasional 1\u20133 variability), the conservative choice is to avoid placing an extra order now and let the in-transit replenish inventory when it arrives.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (recorded). Current visible in-transit=900 units (undated ETAs) likely includes multiple outstanding orders that will materialize across upcoming periods given observed variable lead times (1\u20133). Inventory & demand: on-hand=0; recent realized demand (Periods 46\u201349 = 149, 214, 208, 200) averages ~193 units/period. With L=3, planning horizon is L+1=4 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248 4\xd7193 \u2248 772 units. Pipeline (900) exceeds this coverage and provides safety stock; ordering would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without increasing near-term sales. OR recommended 0 units (uses promised L and history); I agree because pipeline sufficiently covers the next (L+1) periods under the confirmed lead time and elevated demand. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while pipeline clears. Monitor upcoming concluded arrivals; if portions of the 900 prove lost or arrivals are delayed beyond 3 periods, switch to positive ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order\u2014in-transit=900 exceeds L+1 expected demand (~772 units for 4 periods at recent avg ~193), so avoid extra holding cost; monitor for lost/delayed arrivals.",
