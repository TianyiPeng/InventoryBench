Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals yet (no evidence to infer a lead-time change). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) available (Periods 1-5). Use promised lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=126 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist, so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time. Historical demand samples mean=97.2 units/period. With promised L=2, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps a conservative base-stock covering three periods of expected demand while letting the OR engine set safety stock via profit/holding tradeoff. Monitoring: if P1 order concludes missing in coming periods, switch to explicit/ recent lead-time handling.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand 0, in-transit 281 (orders from P1=126 and P2=155). No concluded arrivals yet (arrived=0 in P1 and P2 conclude), but this is consistent with the promised lead time=2 (P1 order would conclude at Period_3 conclude). No sustained evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use defaults so OR backend uses full-sample statistics and promised lead time to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed three consecutive periods with zero concluded arrivals while large orders are in-transit (orders from P1-P3 have not concluded). This suggests actual lead time may be longer than promised; to avoid stockouts I set L explicitly to 3 periods. Demand history (samples: 110,116,74,101,85) shows mean ~97.2; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so the base-stock raises target inventory to cover the longer lead time while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Daily Profit: $308.00, Daily Holding Cost: $132.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (Period4 conclude: arrival of Period1 order with lead_time=3 and Period3 order with lead_time=1). On-hand=132, in-transit=259 (total pipeline=391) which is ample coverage short-term. Evidence is not yet a sustained regime change (only two observed lead-time samples and demand shows no clear shift). I choose L by "calculate" to let the backend average observed lead times rather than blindly using the promised value. For demand parameters I use "default" mu_hat and "default" sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples (no changepoint detected). This balances service (respecting observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given currently large pipeline inventory.

Daily Profit: $376.00, Daily Holding Cost: $38.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: on-hand=38, in-transit=323; demand history samples mean=97.2 (Periods 1-5) with recent demands 77 and 94. Concluded arrivals show lead_times observed = 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4). Evidence insufficient for a sustained lead-time shift (only 2 observed events), so set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the order target consistent with historical demand while the pipeline (38+323=361) already covers multiple review+lead periods, avoiding aggressive extra ordering despite some delayed shipments.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7. Recent demand average = 97.2 units (samples: 110,116,74,101,85). On-hand=0, in-transit=411 (multiple outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times: order from P1 arrived in P4 => LT=3; order from P3 arrived in P4 => LT=1. Use L.method='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability rather than blindly trusting promised). With L determined from observed lead times, use mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that accounts for multi-period coverage (L+1) and observed demand variability while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy arrivals. This balances service level (reduce stockouts given delayed/variable arrivals) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=345, recent demand samples mean= (110+116+74+101+85)/5 = 97.2. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with actual lead_time=3 (Period1->Period4; Period4->Period7) despite promised L=2, so I set L=3 explicitly. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances the higher effective pipeline due to longer lead time while keeping service vs. holding tradeoff aligned with profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period1 order arrived Period4; Period4 order arrived Period7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: Confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods from concluded history (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Current on-hand=38, in-transit=354 \u2014 ample pipeline cover for multiple periods. To ensure the OR engine accounts for the observed longer lead time and maintain service while controlling holding costs, set L explicitly to 3 so base-stock is computed over 1+L=4 periods. Use default demand/volatility aggregation (backend will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because recent demand samples are limited and no sustained demand regime change is detected. This approach aligns ordering with the confirmed 3-period lead time and leverages the existing sample statistics to balance profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5 = 110,116,74,101,85; plus later observed demands through Period_9) show no clear sustained demand regime change. Current on-hand=62 and in-transit=298 provides substantial pipeline cover. Observed concluded lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,1 (avg=2.0), so I use a lead-time estimate based on observed data. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the average observed lead time (2). With no confirmed demand regime shift, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given ample pipeline inventory and no new sustained signal of higher demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=362. History shows confirmed lead time=3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Pipeline (362) must cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand while awaiting arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages full history while the explicit L corrects for delayed arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost.

I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer realized lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all supplied samples (stable sample size, no new sustained demand regime). This balances service (by reflecting confirmed L=3) while avoiding overreaction to short-term demand noise since pipeline already exceeds (1+L)\xd7mean.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Observed demand samples (110,116,74,101,85) give mean \u224897.2/unit-period. On-hand=39, in-transit=334 \u2192 pipeline=373 units, which exceeds expected coverage for a multi-period lead. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) with intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals. I set L using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent cluster of 3-period lead times while still smoothing short 1\u20132 period observations. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L estimated from the recent observations this raises the base-stock to cover the longer effective lead and protects service level while the large existing pipeline limits urgent additional ordering and controls holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand elevated (Periods 9-13 = 87,123,125,80,134; mean=109.8) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=366. Historical concludes confirm lead time is 3 periods (carry-over). Pipeline (366) covers multiple periods but arrivals are delayed/staggered; to protect service with confirmed longer lead time and recent higher mean, I set L explicitly to 3 and use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime while keeping variability measured over the same window.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927, Period11\u219214, etc.), so actual lead time = 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead-time, ensuring the OR backend orders cover the longer pipeline. Demand recently elevated vs early samples; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat uses the latest 5 realized demands (Periods 10-14) to capture current mean/volatility and scale by (1+L). This balances service (meet demand over 4-period pipeline) versus holding cost by focusing forecast on recent regime.

On-hand=0, in-transit=479 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed by 3 periods, so I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (stable sample set mean=97.2). This balances service (accounting for longer lead time) against holding cost by inflating the review+lead demand appropriately while letting OR engine apply its z* calibration.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals at LT=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=447 -> substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed by LT=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine targets (1+L) review+lead demand correctly. I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (stable demand history of five samples). This balances service level (using confirmed longer LT) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent concluded arrivals overwhelmingly show actual lead time \u22483 (many orders placed arrive after 3 periods); on-hand is 0 and in-transit=332 (pipeline large). To avoid under-ordering given observed 3-period actual lead time, set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples, which balances service level against holding cost given the longer effective pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=414. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (majority of observed W=3), so I treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering given overdue pipeline. I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use default (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so mu_hat uses the full-sample mean (mean=97.2 \u2192 (1+3)*97.2\u2248388.8) which smooths variability across the short sample set. Sigma_hat uses default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)) to scale uncertainty for the longer lead+review period. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit) while keeping safety stock moderated by the holding cost ($1/unit) and profit ratio ($4 profit).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=458, recent history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (carry-over confirms lead time=3). Several past orders arrived with 3-period delay and some 1-period anomalies, but the sustained pattern is lead_time=3. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across the (1+L) review+lead horizon from all samples, giving (1+3)-period coverage while balancing profit vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand has risen (last 5 demands = 88,116,152,238,94; mean=137.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=500 (large pipeline) and historical conclues consistently show many 3-period arrivals \u2192 treat lead time as the empirically observed average. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent will scale for the lead+review horizon. Volatility is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated recent variability. These settings balance higher service-level need (profit $4 vs holding $1 encourages fill) against holding cost and the large in-transit stock: the OR engine's base_stock will target safety stock for higher recent mean while capped order logic will limit excessive same-period orders given existing pipeline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=613. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders observed arriving after 3 periods). Demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples) indicates base demand; to account for confirmed LT=3 I set L explicit=3 so the backend computes (1+L)-period demand. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock target given profit/holding tradeoff. This approach handles the observed longer lead time and leverages the large in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering.

On-hand=0, in-transit=613 \u2014 with promised L=2 but multiple concluded arrivals show lead time=3 consistently; pipeline (613) slightly below 4\xd7recent mean (~640). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock covers the current higher-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level risk (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=3 and high recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=23, in-transit=575. Historical conclude messages show multiple orders arriving with lead_time=3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23), so actual lead time is best set to 3. Pipeline is large relative to on-hand so use default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples; this balances service level given high in-transit volume while avoiding manual tuning that could overstock if some shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=575. Recent concludes show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) though occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals exist; pipeline is large but delayed. Profit $4, holding $1 motivates service-focus (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) so use demand and lead-time estimates from observed history. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period behavior). Use mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances higher service level given profit vs holding cost and leverages full sample set despite some shipment variability. No explicit adjustment made because pipeline (575) already large and lead-time estimate will reflect historical 3-period pattern.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=517. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23), so treat actual L=3 to avoid under-ordering. Use L explicit=3 so backend sizes the review+lead forecast for (1+L)=4 periods. Demand has varied but no recent sustained regime shift in mean/variance (>3 periods) beyond normal volatility, so use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This raises the base-stock and safety stock to protect service given longer confirmed lead time and large in-transit volume, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: recent demand has stepped up \u2014 last 5 demands (P23-27) = [132,131,125,139,169], mean \u2248139.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=520 which covers ~3.7 periods at recent mean; target coverage = (1+L)=4 periods so pipeline is slightly short. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 3 in recent history (confirmed carry-over), so I set L=3 explicitly. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime over the last 5 periods, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated short-term demand while keeping holding cost pressure in mind (profit/holding = 4), letting the OR engine compute the base_stock and cap.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=528. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (several orders observed with lead_time=3) though occasional 1-2 period arrivals exist; no sustained recent demand regime shift in the 5-sample demand history (samples: 110,116,74,101,85). Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period pattern). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std)) because demand evidence is limited and not showing a sustained change; this balances service level vs holding cost while letting OR engine compute appropriate safety stock given averaged lead time. Current pipeline (528) is large relative to recent demand, so conservative use of defaults avoids over-adjusting forecasts.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=525. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead-time signals (confirmed earlier). Pipeline (525) likely covers upcoming arrivals but visibility delayed by lead-time. To reflect confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly=3 so the OR engine sizes orders over a 4-period demand horizon. I use default demand and volatility estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples; this balances service (higher L increases coverage) versus holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. Historical concludes show multiple orders arriving with 3-period lag (confirmed earlier), so set lead time to 3 to reflect reality and ensure pipeline covers upcoming demand. Using mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (leveraging full history) to balance service level vs holding cost given higher L and large pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent demand elevated (last 5 demands = 169,106,156,171,131; mean \u2248146.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 (large pipeline but prior confirms variable/occasionally delayed arrivals). Recent observed lead times are mostly 2 periods (recent concluded arrivals: P26\u2192P28, P27\u2192P29, P28\u2192P30, P23\u2192P25, P20\u2192P23) so I use recent average lead time. I set L using recent_N=5 to capture the latest shipping regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (review+lead period aggregation) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime, which balances service (cover elevated recent demand) against holding cost given significant in-transit inventory and occasional delays.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. Recent concluded lead-times show a downward shift (many 2s then a 1 in Period_32), so I prefer a short recent average lead time. Demand has clearly moved above the small-sample historical baseline; use recent demand data to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent regime. I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead-times to respond to the apparent reduction in lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest demand regime. These choices aim to keep pipeline covering (1+L) periods of higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost given current in-transit stock (464 units).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=471. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, etc.). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend plans pipeline over (1+L) periods. Demand/volatility use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) based on all provided samples to let the backend compute base_stock and cap given the updated L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: recent demand has been consistently higher than the initial sample set (sustained demands ~106\u2013238 since Period_18). On-hand=0, in-transit=544 (large pipeline but arrivals are delayed historically). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times often =3 (confirmed earlier); recent pattern of arrivals also includes 2 and 1 but 3-period delays are common and missing/late arrivals have occurred. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline horizon. For demand I detect a sustained regime shift upward starting ~Period_18; I therefore use recent_N with N=17 (the length of the new regime) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead period. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to protect service under longer lead time and higher demand while using recent variance to moderate safety stock against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_18: avg demand increased from 97 (Periods 1-5 baseline) to 148 (Periods 18-34) (+52%).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=647. Historical concluded arrivals confirm variable but predominantly multi-period lead times (several 3-period observations). Demand regime shift (Periods 18-34) raised mean to ~148; recent periods remain in that higher regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from conclues (captures mixed 1\u20133p behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 18\u201334). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=17 so volatility reflects the same recent regime. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability to reduce stockouts despite holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 18 (carry-over note) and multiple arrivals indicating actual lead time longer than promised; earlier confirmed lead time=3. Reconcile: large pipeline (574) likely covers several future periods but arrival timing is delayed (lead_time\u22483). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine plans for arrivals further out. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 to focus the forecast on the post-change regime (Periods 18\u201336) where average demand rose; same recent_N=19 for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices steer the backend to a base-stock sized for the higher, sustained demand and the longer observed lead time, balancing service level against holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Recent demand is in the elevated regime (post-Period_18) \u2014 recent demands (P33-37) = [137,162,132,121,156], mean ~141.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=533 (large pipeline) but promised lead time=2 has historically been 3; multiple concluded arrivals show L=3. To protect service under confirmed longer lead time and higher demand, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime for mu_hat and match volatility with recent_N for sigma_hat. This balances higher service (reducing stockouts given long effective lead time) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time ~3 (carry-over). Recent demand regime (Periods18-34) elevated to ~148 units/period and recent periods (30s) show demand ~120-170. With L=3, review+lead=(1+L)=4. In-transit 596 \u2248 149/unit-period\xd74, so pipeline aligns with elevated demand. Choose L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat recent_N N=20 to base forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to capture the shift). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These settings align base-stock to higher recent mean while L=3 prevents stockouts from underestimated lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent demand elevated (Periods 18-39 mean \u2248148; last 5 demands: 132,121,156,147,185 \u2192 mean \u2248148). On-hand=0, in-transit=573 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 in recent arrivals; using a short recent average captures recent drift while remaining responsive. Set L by recent_N (N=4) to reflect the last 4 observed lead times (1,1,2,2 \u2192 avg=1.5). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so base-stock targets service for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding. These parameters balance higher service (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=533. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133); recent concludes (Periods 36\u201340) are [2,2,1,1] implying shorter/variable lead time \u2014 use recent average. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 18 (carry-over insight) so base demand forecast from recent post-shift history. I set L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect the latest realized lead-time mix (keeps pipeline estimate responsive to late reductions). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=17) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 18\u201334 length \u224817), so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This balances service level (protecting against the higher-demand regime) while letting the capped ordering limitation and updated L constrain excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: recent demand regime is the higher level identified earlier (post-Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=533 \u2014 substantial pipeline but several past shipments arrived late; prior evidence confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods. To protect service given confirmed L=3 and high recent demand, set L explicit=3. For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) to capture the current high-regime mean; same recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting demand spikes while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=649. Historical concludes show multiple confirmed lead_time=3 periods (Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927, Period12 etc.), and several recent 2\u20133 period observations; therefore set L by averaging observed lead times. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift upward starting Period_18 (baseline mean ~97 \u2192 ~148), so use recent data from the post-shift regime to forecast. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures Period_23\u201342 recent behavior while capping at 20). This raises the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to protect service during long lead times and large in-transit exposure, while the backend\u2019s cap limits order sizes to control holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=649. Historical concluces show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) but recent arrivals (most recent 5 observed) average ~1.4 periods, so I set L via recent_N to capture the short-term realized lead time. Demand has been in the higher regime (carry-over noted) and recent 5-period average demand \u2248152.8, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the current elevated demand over the review+lead horizon. Volatility also appears stable recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent std. These choices let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances higher service needs from elevated demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid overstocking against an assumed longer lead time. On-hand + in-transit (649) already provides substantial coverage, so parameters aim to temper additional ordering risk.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: confirmed sustained higher-demand regime since Period_18 (avg ~148) and prior carry-over confirmed lead time=3. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=649 (large pipeline). Some past shipments showed variable 1\u20132 period arrivals but early evidence (Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927) and carry-over confirm actual lead time=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures recent 20 concluded demands since the regime change). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise the base-stock to preserve service (profit > holding cost favors high fill) while the large in-transit reduces immediate order quantity risk of excess holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 18 (avg ~148 historically); recent five-period demand (P41\u2013P45 = 119,190,116,124,170) mean = 143.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=533 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals (including P45 arrival of P42 order with lead_time=3) confirm longer, variable lead times. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-times average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. This keeps target base-stock responsive to current high demand while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering risk and the OR cap will limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=560. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals (confirmed earlier: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P42\u2192P45) and variable 1-3 delays; shipments still arriving after 2+ periods so set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. Recent demand (Periods 42-46 = 190,116,124,170,172) best represents current regime after the earlier shift; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility over the (1+L) review+lead window. These settings aim to build a base-stock covering 4 periods of current demand while reflecting recent variability and avoiding understock given delayed arrivals.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: recent demand regime is the higher regime (shift at Period_18 to ~148 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=673 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times cluster around 2\u20133 with mean \u22482.14, so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime when computing (1+L)*mean; for volatility I use recent_N (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent variance. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=673. Historical concluded lead times are mixed but average drifted above promised 2 \u2014 using backend 'calculate' to let it compute the empirical average lead time. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period_18 (carry-over) and recent demands remain elevated; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast/reactive safety reflect the most recent high-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to single spikes. Large in-transit pipeline reduces urgency to inflate orders; these choices balance service (higher recent mean) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand to set base_stock and letting backend cap orders.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=673. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) with more 1\u20132 values recently; I choose recent_N for L to capture this mix using the last 5 observed lead times. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 18 (carry-over) and the last 5 demands (Periods 45\u201349 = 170,172,159,142,166) average \u2248161.8; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to reflect current elevated demand. Volatility can change with the regime shift, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to let the backend compute recent std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices let the OR engine target service for the current higher-demand regime while adapting to the observed shortening/variability in lead time and avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.
