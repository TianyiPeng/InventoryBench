Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (observed P1\u2192P4; multiple arrivals consistent with L=3). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 720. Demand estimate: use recent periods (P40\u2013P49) which reflect the sustained higher regime: demands = [173,176,197,169,133,185,135,181,137,189], mean \u2248 167.5 units/period. Ordering requirement: need to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (current period's demand plus L future periods) = 4 \xd7 167.5 \u2248 670 units. Comparison: in-transit 720 > 670, so pipeline already covers expected coverage horizon. Cost tradeoff: Profit = Holding cost, so critical fractile = 0.5 \u2192 no safety-stock push; avoid unnecessary ordering to prevent holding cost. OR recommended 0; I concur and place 0 to avoid excess holding cost given ample pipeline. Final strategy: place 0 now, monitor upcoming conclude messages to confirm arrivals and detect any lost shipments; if significant shortfall appears when arrivals conclude, order then to restore coverage.",
