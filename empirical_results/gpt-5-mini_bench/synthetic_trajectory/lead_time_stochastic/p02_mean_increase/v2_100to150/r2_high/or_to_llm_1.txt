OR recommended 0 units; I accept it because the large in-transit volume sufficiently covers expected demand while actual lead time is long/variable. Final strategy: place no order this period to let in-transit inventory arrive and avoid extra holding cost. Monitor concluded arrivals next periods to detect lost shipments or sustained demand changes and revise orders if pipeline falls below (L+1)-period demand coverage.",
