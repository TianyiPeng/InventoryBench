Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular): [110,116,74,101,85] (mean=97.2, sd\u224816.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time deviations or regime shifts. Use promised lead time (default) L=2 because no observed lead times to calculate; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample. This provides a neutral base-stock that balances service (using mean demand over review+lead) against holding cost given symmetric profit=holding. No explicit adjustments since no sustained change or delayed shipments observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=126 (order placed P1 not yet arrived per Period_1 conclude: arrived=0). No concluded arrivals yet to infer a lead-time change, so keep promised lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all samples (no sustained regime change detected). This balances service (cover (1+L) periods of expected demand) against holding cost while awaiting confirmation of arrivals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in P1 (126) and P2 (155) but no arrivals yet; with promised L=2 these in-transit units (281) are expected to arrive later so not yet overdue. Demand history (samples provided) is moderately variable; no sustained regime shift confirmed. To avoid overreacting to the short noisy series and because we have a large in-transit pipeline, use defaults: keep L as promised, and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample statistics. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) while avoiding extra holding cost by relying on existing in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (sum of prior orders). Conclude history shows orders placed P1,P2,P3 have not arrived by their expected conclude dates \u2192 delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative, set lead time L=3 (explicit) to let the OR engine hold more pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing higher safety-stock (due to longer L) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed on Periods 1-3 (126,155,45 = 326 units) have not concluded by Period_3 conclude; suggests actual lead time >2 or shipments lost.

Daily Profit: $77.00, Daily Holding Cost: $94.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period_4 conclude reports P1 order arrived with lead_time=3 and P3 order arrived with lead_time=1; P2 (155) still not concluded and may be delayed/lost. Current on-hand=94 and in-transit=254. To let the OR engine infer an appropriate effective lead time from observed arrivals, I choose L=calculate (average observed lead times). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while letting the engine adjust for the inferred lead time and known demand history.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical demand samples mean=97.2 (periods 1-5). Observed concluded lead times: Period4 conclude shows P1\u2192P4 (lead=3) and P3\u2192P4 (lead=1) => observed lead times = {3,1}, average=2. Reconciling pipeline: 318 in-transit likely includes multiple outstanding orders (some overdue in earlier periods) so we must account for lead-time variability. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (2) rather than promised 2, capturing realized variability. For demand forecast I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 3*97.2, reflecting demand across review+lead period without overfitting to short recent noise. For sigma_hat I use 'default' so volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which scales uncertainty for the multi-period horizon. These choices balance service (by acknowledging longer observed lead times) and holding cost (by using full-sample demand stats rather than overreacting to recent spikes).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent history shows variable lead times \u2014 observed arrivals indicate lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); several later orders remain in-transit. On-hand=0, in-transit=408 which the backend will treat as pipeline. Demand history (110,116,74,101,85) will be used by backend; to let OR engine infer appropriate review+lead demand and volatility while accounting for observed lead-time variability I request the backend compute lead time from observed concludes and use default demand aggregation. This balances service (use observed lead-time average) vs holding cost by not overfitting short-run noise in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=311. Historical demand samples mean=97.2 (n=5); recent demands stable with no clear regime shift. Concluded arrivals reveal variable but systematically longer lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3). To account for actual lead-time drift vs promised 2, set L using observed average so the OR backend inflates pipeline coverage. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (higher base stock when L>promised) against holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times: Period1->Period4 = 3, Period3->Period4 = 1, Period4->Period7 = 3 (average observed lead_time \u2248 2.33).

Daily Profit: $64.00, Daily Holding Cost: $2.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=2, in-transit=351. Historical demand samples mean=97.2 units/period (samples: 110,116,74,101,85). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times observed = [3,1,3,3,1] (avg \u22482.2) and some earlier long delays/lost-shipment signals. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Given large pipeline relative to expected demand, defaults keep forecast anchored to historical mean while L=caclulated captures longer actual lead times; the capped order will limit excess ordering and balance service vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand=21, in-transit=297. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but stable observed lead times (3,1,3,3,1,1 => mean 2.0) and earlier missing arrivals suggest occasional delays/lost shipments. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost and uses the full sample set to smooth variability and account for the mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical observed lead times (from concluded messages) average ~2.0 (evidence through Period 10). Demand samples: [110,116,74,101,85] (mean\u224897.2). Given confirmed average lead time \u22482 and large pipeline (363> (1+L)*mean), use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality and default demand/volatility formulas so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids placing new orders while ample pipeline stock is expected to arrive, balancing service level and holding cost.

Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [3,1,3,3,1,1] (mean=2.0) \u2014 earlier delayed/lost shipments occurred but recent evidence supports a 2-period average. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will compute mean\u22482). I use default demand methods so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages the full sample set (stable mean ~97.2) while letting the OR engine apply its service-level tradeoff given equal profit/holding costs.

Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast equals (1+L)*mean(all samples) and volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging full sample set (Period_1-5) to balance service level vs holding cost given large pipeline and confirmed multi-period lead time variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=337. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) show mixed values (3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2) with mean \u22482.125 but lead time was previously confirmed as 2 at Period 10. Demand history samples mean=97.2 (samples: 110,116,74,101,85). I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times average (captures recent variability); mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This balances service level (using observed lead-time behavior) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15. Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (1\u20133) with mean \u22482 and demand has been volatile but without a sustained new regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (large pipeline covering several periods). I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasts anchored to full-history demand while the backend caps orders using its cap formula; with large in-transit inventory this avoids over-ordering while still covering (L+1) periods of demand.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history; this yields a base-stock aligned with observed demand while letting the capped policy limit order size to control holding given profit=holding.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=306. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) show many 3s and some 1s; average of observed lead times \u22482.3. Pipeline (306) is large relative to recent demand samples (mean of samples=97.2), but arrivals may continue to be delayed. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (aligns promised vs observed). For demand, use default mu_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples; this leverages all historical demand samples (stable, small sample set). Use default sigma_hat so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples. These settings let the OR engine inflate reorder targets for the longer inferred lead time while keeping demand estimate conservative given no clear regime shift; relying on defaults avoids overfitting to recent noise while the large in-transit stock reduces urgent ordering need.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical concluded lead times average ~2 (carry-over confirms lead_time=2 at P10) so use promised/default lead time. Large pipeline (328) likely already covers near-term (1+L) demand, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR engine compute the base-stock and cap while accounting for promised L=2. This approach is conservative given past delayed arrivals and avoids over-ordering into holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical conclude messages show variable arrivals but lead time was confirmed as 2 periods in prior analysis; no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time. Using default methods (promised L=2) lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples, which balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each). This also lets the backend account for pipeline inventory when capping orders and avoids overreacting to intermittent lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent demand has been volatile with large stockouts (last two concludes demand 152,238). On-hand=0, in-transit=328 \u2014 pipeline currently exceeds (1+L)\xd7mean demand for typical L\u22482 (mean historical demand=97.2 \u2192 3\xd7mean\u2248291.6) so coverage is adequate. Observed lead times vary and recent observations average >2 (multiple 3-period arrivals and some 1s); I select L by averaging observed lead times so the OR backend uses actual realized lead-time history. For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine can compute base_stock and cap using full sample stats. This balances service (capture variable lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume and profit=holding parity.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=405. Historical concluded lead times show variability but recent aggregated evidence (carry-over) confirms actual lead time \u22482 periods; promised L=2 remains appropriate. Recent demand has stepped up and become more volatile (last 5 concluded demands: P16-20 = 88,116,152,238,94) so I use recent-N demand estimates to capture the new regime. Setting L=default (promised=2) lets the OR engine use known contract lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the elevated mean and higher volatility so orders replenish enough for (1+L) periods without gross overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=413. Recent concluded lead-time history shows mixed 1\u20133 periods with mean \u22482 (earlier periods confirmed mean=2); several shipments were delayed/lost earlier but overall observed average lead time is near 2. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-times average. Demand has been elevated and volatile in recent periods (e.g., P18\u2013P21 spikes), so I bias the forecast toward recent demand while not overfitting: use EWMA for mu_hat with moderate recency (gamma=0.4). Sigma_hat left as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (captures recent higher demand and lead-time uncertainty) against holding cost given holding cost equals profit.

Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap while reflecting the 3-period review+lead demand.

Period 24. Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (many 3s, 2s and 1s) with overall observed mean \u22482.33; current on-hand=43 and in-transit=328 (large pipeline). To account for observed lead-time variability I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Demand history samples (110,116,74,101,85) are limited and show no clear, sustained shift in mean/variance, so I use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine set base-stock while the calculated L captures the higher effective pipeline exposure and helps balance service level vs holding cost.

Pipeline is large (378) likely covering multiple outstanding late shipments; to balance service vs holding cost I set L by calculating the average observed lead time, and I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the recent higher-demand regime while keeping volatility estimate aligned with that window.

Use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level with holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 => moderate z). Default methods keep orders conservative while avoiding excess explicit increases given already-large pipeline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=501. Historical concluded lead times average ~2 (confirmed Period_10). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime since ~Period_18 (periods 18\u201327 demand: 152,238,94,136,179,132,131,125,139,169; mean\u2248149.5) so I increase forecast to reflect the recent higher demand. I set L to use calculated/confirmed lead time=2. I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 10 periods (captures new higher-demand regime) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent. I set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 10 periods to capture current volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods, use available evidence of lead-time=2, and raise target base-stock to balance service level vs holding cost given much in-transit inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Historical concluded lead times are mixed but carry-over confirms mean lead_time=2.0 (sustained evidence through Period 10). Given large in-transit pipeline and confirmed average lead time, use calculated L (average of observed lead times) so the OR engine aligns to empirical lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) to let the backend leverage full historical demand data; this balances service level (profit=holding cost) without over-adjusting to recent noise while pipeline is large and some shipments were previously delayed/lost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times but recent evidence (Period1->4,3->4,4->7, etc.) averages near 2; use observed average lead time so OR backend sees realized behavior. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set (no strong, sustained demand regime shift detected). The large in-transit stock (558) likely covers multiple review+lead periods; keeping defaults prevents over-ordering while the backend's cap prevents extreme orders given pipeline. If actual lead_time differs, using calculated L will help align target base-stock with observed arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand 0, large in-transit = 501. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time around promised (confirmed as 2 at Period 10) and no new sustained demand regime change. Use promised lead time to let backend account for historical lead-time variability. Demand sample set (110,116,74,101,85) yields a stable mean; use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) so base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This provides a neutral service-level (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) balancing profit vs holding cost while the large pipeline should cover upcoming demand and avoid over-ordering given holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=501. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20133 periods with mean \u22482; pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain. Choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' (use all samples) so forecasts reflect the full historical demand baseline ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (accounting for inferred longer average lead time) against holding cost given already-large in-transit stock.

On-hand=0, in-transit=501 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrival timing uncertain. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to use all demand samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because demand appears consistently elevated and no new sustained regime shift is confirmed. These settings balance service (use observed lead time) vs. holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates and the OR engine's cap.

History shows variable actual lead times (1,2,3) with recent evidence averaging near 2 periods; many earlier late arrivals but no new sustained regime change in demand. Given large pipeline but uncertain arrivals, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples\u2014this balances service (by using observed lead time) against holding cost without overreacting to noisy recent arrivals.

Large in-transit stock exists (501) so use promised lead time to avoid overstating pipeline; use default demand/volatility calculation based on full sample history to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Recent concluded history shows lead time behavior returned to promised 2 periods (carry-over confirmed). Given large in-transit stock (501) and confirmed lead time=2, use the promised lead time and default demand/statistics so OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples. This avoids overreacting to intermittent lost shipments earlier while letting the backend cap orders using its cap logic; it balances service level (covering 3 periods of average demand) versus holding cost because on-hand is zero but pipeline is large.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=501. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Periods 1-40) shows mean observed lead_time \u2248 2.0 (confirmed at Period 10). Given large in-transit pipeline and confirmed average lead time, set L using calculate (use observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this balances service vs holding cost automatically (profit=holding, q=0.5). This approach trusts confirmed lead-time history while letting the backend compute demand aggregation and safety stock from full sample set.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Recent demand history shows elevated and variable demand (many periods with demand ~120\u2013185). On-hand=0 but large pipeline=501 units (likely sufficient to cover upcoming demand). Past concluded messages confirmed actual lead time \u22482 historically and no new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes in recent periods. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this trusts the backend's baseline forecast while avoiding overreaction to noise or transient delays and balances service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=501. Recent history shows varied lead times but confirmed average \u22482 periods; demand has been high and volatile across periods. To align the OR engine with observed lead-time behavior I'll let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Use default demand and volatility scaling so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (backend will incorporate L). This keeps base_stock consistent with historical demand while relying on calculated L to reflect actual delivery timing and avoid over/under-ordering given large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demands have been high and volatile (many periods of demand >100). On-hand=0, in-transit=501 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals are subject to varying lead times observed historically. Observed concluded lead times average ~2.0 periods; use calculated lead time to reflect realized behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history, letting the OR engine produce the base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost given the chosen L. This approach acknowledges the confirmed average lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to stabilize orders given remaining horizon.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=501. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3,2,1,2; mean \u22482.21). Pipeline is large but uncertain due to past lost/delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures the realized >2 pattern). Demand has shifted higher recently; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (Periods 40\u201344 demands = 154,119,190,116,124) to focus forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime and avoid overweighting early low-demand samples. These choices balance service (higher base stock for raised recent demand and longer realized lead time) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit volume.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 decision: recent demand has been high and variable; on-hand=0, in-transit=523. Historical conclude messages (up to Period_45) show actual lead time has fluctuated but was confirmed as 2 in prior analysis; many delayed/no arrivals suggest shipment uncertainty but current pipeline is large (523 units). To let the OR engine use its promised-lead-time analytics and historical demand samples, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend applies promised L=2 and full-sample demand stats. This avoids overfitting to intermittent delivery noise while the large in-transit volume should cover upcoming demand without extra ordering pressure.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=523. Promised lead time=2 and past concluded messages (Period_10) confirm actual lead time = 2, so use default lead time to keep model aligned with contract. Demand samples available (110,116,74,101,85) give mean\u224897.2; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently. With large in-transit volume (523) we avoid inflating forecast or safety stock beyond what the backend baseline computes; defaults balance service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Use calculate for L so backend uses observed lead-time history. Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this avoids overreacting to intermittent missing arrivals while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period_49 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=523 units. Historical conclude messages (up to Period_10) show actual lead time around 2 and later confirmations; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change since last insights. To be conservative given large in-transit pipeline and symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1), use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its calibrated base-stock (balances service level vs holding cost) while relying on existing pipeline to cover upcoming demand.

Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level (profit=holding cost so q=0.5) while leveraging full-sample demand statistics; large in-transit suggests upcoming arrivals will cover demand, so no explicit inflation of mu/sigma is needed now.
