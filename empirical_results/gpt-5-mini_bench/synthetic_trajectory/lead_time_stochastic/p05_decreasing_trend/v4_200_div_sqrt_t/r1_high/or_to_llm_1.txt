Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=255. From carry-over, recent sustained demand regime (Periods 6\u201314 and carried forward) single-period mean \u224863.7. With actual L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand before new orders would become visible: required pipeline \u22484 \xd7 63.7 = 254.8 units. Current pipeline+on-hand = 255 \u2265 254.8, so we already meet the base-stock requirement under observed low-demand regime. OR recommended 38 (uses promised L=2 and full history); because actual lead time is longer and recent mean is ~63.7, OR's 38 would create excess inventory and holding cost. Final strategy: place no order this period (0 units) and wait to observe how the in-transit 255 arrives (monitor conclude messages) before placing replenishment. If future concluded data show rising demand or lost shipments, resume ordering accordingly.",
