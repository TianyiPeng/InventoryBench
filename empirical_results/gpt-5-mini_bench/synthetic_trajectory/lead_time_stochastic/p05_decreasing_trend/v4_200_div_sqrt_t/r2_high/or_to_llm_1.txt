Given high profit relative to holding cost (q=0.95), conservative stocking to avoid costly stockouts is appropriate, but I reduce OR's aggressive order slightly because substantial pipeline (217) already exists and short-term observed demand is lower.

Demand outlook: recent sustained low-demand regime (Periods 18\u201349 avg \u224840\u201350 units), so expected (L+1)=4-period demand \u2248160\u2013200 units. OR recommends 0 using promised L and historical demand; given large pipeline (446 >> 4-period demand) placing additional order risks excessive holding cost ($1/unit/period) despite high unit profit. Therefore place 0 units to avoid overstock while awaiting arrivals and further concluded arrival messages to infer timing or losses.",
