Reasoning: Pipeline (347 total units) is already large relative to single-period demand and will partially arrive during this episode; placing the OR-recommended 188 would materially increase ending inventory and raise holding cost (holding cost = profit, so excess inventory directly reduces objective). Actual lead time may be \u22653 based on one arrival, which would delay any new order's usefulness and increase risk of tying up inventory for longer.

Decision logic: do not place new orders because (1) large reported in-transit volume (2089) likely sufficient to cover multiple periods if they arrive, (2) high uncertainty/lost-shipment risk argues against topping up early, and (3) holding cost equals profit so excess ending inventory directly reduces objective.
