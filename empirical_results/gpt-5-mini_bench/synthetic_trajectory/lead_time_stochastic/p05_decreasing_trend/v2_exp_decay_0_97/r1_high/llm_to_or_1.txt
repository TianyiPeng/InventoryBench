Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical samples available (187,189,158,158,184) but no evidence of regime change or delayed/lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=202 (order placed P1 not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals observed to change promised lead time, and only one conclude (P1) shows arrived=0 so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Use default lead time (promised L=2). Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained regime change, so use default demand aggregation: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine's baseline forecast and safety stock while conservatively accounting for the outstanding in-transit units and avoiding overreaction to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=427 (matches orders from P1/P2). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical demand samples show stable baseline (given dataset). Use default lead time (promised=2) so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This keeps target base-stock aligned with long-run demand while avoiding premature adjustments based on inconclusive arrival signals.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=610 (orders from P1\u2013P3: 202+225+183). Promised lead time=2 but P1's order (ordered P1) has not concluded (arrived=0 in P3 conclude) \u2014 possible delay/lost shipment but evidence is not yet sustained. Demand history (used for defaults) available; to be conservative and let the OR engine use its calibrated base-stock formula, I keep L as promised and use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This provides a stable forecast while the pipeline anomalies resolve; it avoids overreacting to a single missed conclude and relies on OR's capped ordering to limit exposure to holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3195.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed mixed lead times in concluded history: Period1 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=3), Period3 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=1). This indicates lead time variability but average so far is 2. To be robust to the observed variability and because promised lead time=2, I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand history (187,189,158,158,184) yields mean ~175.2; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, balancing service level against holding cost while reflecting the chosen lead-time estimate. This approach handles delayed/early arrivals without overfitting to only two concluded shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3794.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Recent demand samples (P1-5) average 175.2 units; on-hand=6, in-transit=439 (large pipeline). Historical arrivals show variable lead times (observed 3 and 1), so I let the backend compute average observed lead time rather than trusting the promised 2. I use L=calculate to let OR set lead time = average observed; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend will size base-stock and caps using the full-sample demand stats while accounting for inferred lead time. This balances service (large pipeline + demand mean) against holding cost given current high in-transit volume and limited on-hand, and is conservative about lost/delayed shipments.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=655. Recent demand (periods 1-6) shows variability but no sustained regime shift (demands: 225,159,165,179,200,152). Concluded arrivals reveal observed lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4), average = 2 which matches promised lead time. Several orders (e.g., Period_2 order) remain in-transit past promised arrival \u2014 watch for potential lost/delayed shipments, but evidence is not yet a sustained lead-time change. I choose L="calculate" so the backend uses the average observed lead time; mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8. On-hand=0, in-transit=785. Concluded arrivals show one order (P1\u2192P4) with lead_time=3 and one (P3\u2192P4) with lead_time=1; average observed lead_time=2 which matches promised lead_time. Historical demand samples (provided) mean=175.2 units/period. I set L method to calculate so backend uses observed lead times average. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures full-sample demand signal and variability). This keeps forecasting simple given limited sustained changepoint evidence and the large in-transit pipeline; it balances service level (use 3-period coverage) vs holding cost conservatively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3016.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=176, in-transit=441. Historical arrived messages show observed lead times of 3,1,3,1 (orders from P1,P3,P5,P7), average = 2 which matches promised lead time. Demand history (187,189,158,158,184) has mean=175.2. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average (2). I choose mu_hat='default' so backend uses (1+L)*mean_all_samples = 3*175.2 and sigma_hat='default' so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given mixed lead-time signals and no sustained regime shift. This also conservatively handles delayed arrivals by relying on observed lead-time average rather than recent noisy alternation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2864.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent concluded history shows variable but symmetric lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1}, avg=2). On-hand=24, in-transit=597 \u2192 large pipeline available so avoid upping forecast aggressively. Historical demand samples mean = (187+189+158+158+184)/5 = 175.2. I select L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times; use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts grounded in full history and avoiding overreaction to short-term variability while the pipeline is large.

Carry-over insight: Lead time average confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P1->P4 W=3, P3->P4 W=1, P5->P8 W=3, P7->P8 W=1; avg=2.0).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=743. Recent conclude history shows mixed lead times but prior carry-over confirmed avg=2. To be conservative and let backend use observed lead-time history, I select L via calculate. Demand history (samples mean ~175.2) is limited and shows no clear recent regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap. This balances service (using observed lead-time) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over previously confirmed average lead time ~2. In-transit (762) provides multi-period coverage; use promised/default lead time so backend uses promised L=2 and full-sample demand stats for base-stock. Choosing default mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps forecasts stable given no clear recent regime change and balances service level versus holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=170, in-transit=460, recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but prior analysis confirmed avg=2. On-hand + in-transit (630) comfortably covers several periods of demand, but past variability and occasional delayed arrivals justify using observed lead-time averaging. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of concluded lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20133 period arrivals). For demand and volatility I use 'default' so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine compute base-stock with the promised lead-time view while using the calculated empirical L to account for observed delivery variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=52, in-transit=583. Recent conclude history confirms average lead time ~2 (carry-over recorded). Pipeline is large (583) so no urgent correction for lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time to align with OR backend (L=2). Demand samples limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.

No sustained demand regime shift detected (recent demands roughly consistent with history). Choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level given high in-transit volume while avoiding overreaction to noisy lead-time variability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=1, in-transit=621. Recent conclude history shows multiple arrivals with lead times = [3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3] (avg\u22482.38), suggesting realized lead time is drifting above promised 2. I choose L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the recent 3-period arrivals). Demand sample mean from provided historical samples is 175.2; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with chosen L. This increases the base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline and protects service level given many in-transit units and observed 3-period shipments while keeping volatility treatment standard.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears increased vs promised: observed lead times (8 observations) = [3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3], average \u22482.38; multiple 3-period arrivals indicate a sustained shift toward longer lead times.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Recent conclude history shows multiple 3-period arrivals and an elevated average lead time (~2.38) from Periods in history. Given ambiguous but sustained upward drift in lead times, let backend compute observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). Demand samples show no clear recent mean shift, so use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine size base stock; this balances service (captures longer lead time via calculated L) versus holding cost while existing large pipeline will be considered when ordering.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Recent concluded lead times (last 8 observed) = [3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3], avg\u22482.375 \u2192 I treat lead time as elevated vs promised. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P14-P18) = [147,163,122,129,100], mean\u2248132.2. To reflect the sustained longer lead-time regime and recent demand level I set L using recent_N over the last 8 observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N over the last 5 demand samples ((1+L) scaling is applied by backend). This raises the order-up-to (base stock) to cover the longer pipeline exposure while using recent samples to respond to the recent downward drift in demand, balancing service level (avoid stockouts with longer L) against holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times and prior carry-over noted average lead time \u22482.38 (sustained increase vs promised=2). I will let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so L reflects realized behaviour. Demand history is limited and no clear recent mean shift in demand samples; use default demand sizing and volatility so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service (longer inferred lead time) with holding cost while leveraging observed pipeline (large in-transit) to avoid overordering.

On-hand=0, in-transit=736 \u2014 large pipeline but recent conclude messages (Periods 18-20) show no arrivals, suggesting delays vs promised. Prior carry-over (Period 17) noted average lead time >2. I choose L via 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures the recent shift toward longer lead times). For demand forecast and uncertainty I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), respectively; this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/lengthened lead times and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

To let the OR engine incorporate measured lead-time behavior while avoiding new over-ordering given the large in-transit stock, I request the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine cap orders against pipeline inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift toward longer leads (Period 17 insight). I set L using recent_N over the last 8 observed lead times to capture the confirmed shift (more 3-period arrivals). Demand has softened in the most recent 5 concluded periods (Periods 18-22 = 100,132,142,105,124), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the lower recent demand. This combination raises lead-time coverage while letting the backend compute base_stock and the capped order; it balances higher safety from longer leads against lower recent demand to avoid excess holding cost.

I choose L=calculate so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the sustained shift toward longer lead times).

LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concl. show multiple 3-period arrivals since early periods and a sustained shift toward longer lead times noted at Period_17. Recent demand (Periods 20-24) is lower (~115 units avg) than early samples, so I use recent observations for demand and volatility and use recent lead-time observations to capture the longer/mixed lead-time behavior. Choices: L by recent_N to reflect observed lead-time shift; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the recent lower-demand regime and current volatility. These parameters supply the OR engine with a forecast that prioritizes service given extended/variable lead times while containing holding cost by using recent lower demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=736 \u2014 large pipeline but many late/undelivered shipments in history. Concluded arrivals (multiple periods) show a sustained shift to longer lead times (seen repeatedly since Period 10; Period 17 summary showed avg\u22482.38). I therefore let backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate) so L reflects realized behavior. Demand sample set provided is small; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula with the inferred L and historical demand stats. This balances higher safety stock (to cover delayed arrivals) against holding cost while leveraging the backend's capped ordering logic.

With substantial pipeline and uncertain lead-time regime, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it balance service vs holding cost given the inferred L.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=736 (large pipeline). Recent concluded history (many lead_time=3 arrivals since P17) indicates lead times have shifted longer vs promised; choose explicit L=3 to reflect sustained 3-period arrivals. Demand has fallen recently (last 5 period demands: 97,108,91,77,70 \u2192 mean\u224888.6) versus earlier sample mean\u2248175.2; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base stock to current lower-demand regime while accounting for longer lead time and pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=736, recent concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.38 (sustained shift vs promised=2). Use L=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. Demand samples mean=175.2; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so order targets account for the longer inferred lead time while respecting the OR cap. This balances higher safety stock needed from longer lead times against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=736; many past arrivals showed a shift toward longer lead times (multiple 3-period arrivals and average \u22482.38). To capture the recent lead-time drift I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times (recent_N=8). Demand estimate and volatility use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this keeps demand forecast anchored to all data while the longer L raises required pipeline cover to protect service given delayed arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=736 \u2014 large pipeline exists but arrivals have been delayed historically. To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments I set L explicitly to 3 (accounts for observed 3-period arrivals and protects service level). Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full sample history while the longer explicit L increases coverage (L+1 periods) to balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Recent demand samples show lower but variable demand (history provided). On-hand=0, in-transit=736 \u2014 large pipeline but many past arrivals occurred late; carry-over indicates lead time has trended longer (~2.38). To be conservative versus promised L=2, set L explicit=3 to account for observed 3-period arrivals and potential delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend scales demand and variability for the chosen (1+L) review+lead window; this lets the engine compute base-stock while we bias lead time upward to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Many concluded arrivals stopped after Period_16 despite large in-transit balance, suggesting some shipments delayed or lost and realized lead time has trended above promised 2 (prior evidence avg\u22482.38). I therefore average recent observed lead times to reflect the longer realized lead time. Demand recently settled lower than early-sample regime; I use recent demand (last 10 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L) periods of realistic demand and avoids overstocking while covering the stretched pipeline. This accounts for overdue shipments by increasing lead-time input and grounding demand estimates in the most recent regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=736. Recent concluded arrivals (carry-over) show lead times skewed above promised with last 8 observed lead times avg\u22482.38 and multiple 3-periods; to account for this I set L via recent_N=8 so the backend uses recent observed lead-time behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the adjusted lead time and large in-transit volume.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained shift to longer lead times (recent observed W sequence length 8 avg\u22482.38). Demand has been lower and stable since Period 18 (17 periods of recent lower demand). To capture increased actual lead time use recent_N over last 8 observed lead times. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 17 demand periods. These choices increase pipeline cover for longer/more variable lead time while sizing forecast and safety stock to the recent lower-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained shift toward longer lead times (multiple 3-period arrivals since Period 10; recent average \u22482.38), and we currently have large in-transit inventory (736) but zero on-hand. Set L using recent_N to reflect observed longer lead times. Demand has been lower in recent periods (Periods 31-35 mean \u224868.2), so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service level given longer lead times against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: recent concluded history shows multiple 3-period lead times and an elevated average (~2.38) vs promised 2; several earlier orders remain in-transit (736) while on-hand=0. To guard against further delayed arrivals I set L explicitly to 3 (best estimate of actual lead time). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples so forecasts scale with the longer effective lead time while the capped order prevents excessively large single-period orders given the large pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals show lead times longer than promised (multiple 3-period arrivals since Period_10, carry-over notes avg\u22482.38). Recent demand (Periods 18\u201337) is a sustained lower regime vs early periods (~20 periods of lower demand). Given large in-transit volume and evidence of longer actual lead time, set L to calculated average of observed lead times so backend uses empirical lead-time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (captures longer lead time) while reducing target stock to match lower recent demand and avoid excess holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical conclude messages show actual lead times have been variable with a demonstrated shift toward longer lead times (multiple 3-period arrivals observed earlier). To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, set L method to calculate (average of observed lead times). Demand has clearly shifted down since Period 18 and this low-demand regime has persisted (~21 periods through Period 38). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime, reducing overstating demand and holding costs while accounting for current variability and the longer observed lead times.

To capture this, set L using recent_N over the last 8 observed lead times to reflect the upward shift. Demand has clearly trended lower in later periods vs initial samples; to focus the forecast on current regime, use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent demand mean/volatility over the review+lead window). These choices raise the pipeline cover for longer delivery times while sizing base-stock to recent lower demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical conclude messages show multiple multi-period arrivals and a sustained shift toward longer lead times since Period 17. Use 'calculate' for L so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the shift vs promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this leverages full history while letting the backend scale for the inferred lead time. With large in-transit inventory, this approach avoids over-ordering while the calculated L raises cover for delayed arrivals, balancing service level against the low holding cost.

Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical conclude messages show multiple 3-period arrivals and prior carry-over indicates average lead time \u22482.38 (sustained shift toward longer lead times). To be conservative against delayed/lost shipments and ensure pipeline covers demand, set L explicitly to 3 (use longer lead time than promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine scale forecasts and safety stock given the explicit longer lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical conclude messages (notably Periods cited in carry-over) show lead times frequently 3 and sometimes 1 with recent average \u22482.38; to reflect this shift I use recent_N for L (N=8) to bias lead-time estimate above the promised 2. For demand I see no confirmed sustained demand regime change (earlier small-sample seeds only); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service vs holding cost given the adjusted L. This addresses overdue/misaligned arrivals by increasing coverage for the longer observed lead time while avoiding an explicit manual demand forecast change.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times and carry-over insight flagged a shift toward longer lead times. To be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained shift (reduces risk of under-ordering given delayed arrivals). Large pipeline (736) already covers many periods, so use default demand estimates to let the OR engine scale orders: mu_hat=default uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (longer L) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

I set L via recent_N using the last 8 observed lead times to capture the shift toward longer/variable lead times. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to historical demand while the increased L raises coverage (L+1 periods) to protect service given delayed arrivals, and default volatility avoids overfitting noisy recent demand.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained shift toward longer/more variable lead times (recent observed sequence of 8 lead times avg \u22482.38). Recent demand has fallen vs early history (last 5 demands: 107,77,31,8,45). To reflect the confirmed longer lead-time regime while anchoring forecast to current low demand, I set L based on the most recent 8 observed lead times and use recent-5 demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant, recent regime. This balances service (accounting for longer arrivals) against holding cost given current low demand and large in-transit volume.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times and an increased average lead time (~2.38 over 8 observed). To account for the sustained shift toward longer/variable lead times I set L using recent_N=8 (average of last 8 observed lead times). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) based on that inferred L; this raises target base-stock to cover the longer pipeline while letting the engine trade off service level vs holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals (carry-over) show lead times trending longer (multiple 3-period arrivals); recent demand has dropped substantially (Periods 43-47 demands = 31,8,45,16,7; mean\u224821.4). To be conservative vs. suspected longer lead times I set L explicit=3 to cover the observed 3-period arrivals. With (1+L)=4 I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasting and variability to the current low-demand regime (most recent 5 periods), keeping inventory/cap decisions responsive and avoiding excess holding cost while covering near-term demand. Large in-transit (736) will be counted by pipeline; parameters aim to avoid new large orders while ensuring service through the 3-period lead-time window.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_49. On-hand=0, In-transit=736. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times and prior carry-over noted avg \u22482.38 \u2192 sustained shift toward longer lead times. To capture recent lead-time behavior use recent_N over the last 8 observed lead-time samples. Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period_18; to reflect recent demand levels and variability I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the recent low-demand regime while respecting the N caps). These choices raise expected pipeline coverage (via L) and base-stock (via recent demand mean) to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals while sigma_hat recent_N uses the same window to reflect recent volatility for the OR backend tradeoff between service and holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded history (last conclude with arrivals was Period 17) shows a sustained shift toward longer lead times vs promised (multiple 3-period arrivals). Demand has clearly fallen since Period 18 and remained low for many periods; to avoid overstocking given large in-transit (736) and zero on-hand, use a lead-time estimate based on observed history and forecast demand from the recent low-demand regime (last 20 periods) to keep orders conservative while maintaining service. L set to calculated average of observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=20) to capture the new lower-demand regime.
