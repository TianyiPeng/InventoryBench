Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "State & inference: On-hand=0, in-transit=701. Carry-over history confirms actual lead time ~3 periods and a sustained low-demand regime (avg \u224853.5 units/period since ~Period 30). Demand outlook: recent periods average ~50\u201355 units/period, so 701 units in-transit covers ~12\u201314 periods of expected demand. Cost tradeoff: profit=$1 and holding=$1 so critical fractile q=0.5 (OR's z*=0) \u2014 no safety stock incentive. Risk: some shipments historically delayed/lost, but the large pipeline (>700) already provides substantial coverage even if part is delayed. OR recommended 0 units; given the large pipeline relative to expected demand and equal profit/holding costs, placing new orders risks unnecessary ending inventory holding costs if arrivals complete. Decision: place 0 orders. This avoids adding to pipeline while existing in-transit inventory is likely sufficient to satisfy demand for many periods even with lead-time variability. I will not record a new carry-over insight because lead-time=3 and the demand regime shift are already captured.",
