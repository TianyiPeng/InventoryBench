Demand analysis: historical demands = [193,180,207,154,239]; mean \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 194.6 units/period, sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 31.6.

Risk assessment & decision: If actual lead time is 3, the relevant protection horizon is (L+1)=4 periods (current period + 3 future), i.e., ~779 units; current pipeline (350) would leave a large shortfall. Given only a single confirmed late arrival (not yet meeting the 3+ period requirement for a sustained carry-over insight), I partially increase the order above OR's capped recommendation to hedge the demonstrated risk of longer lead time while avoiding excessive holding cost.
