Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (default) because no observed lead-time shifts. Demand history (217,207,170,131,185) will be summarized by backend; choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio and no signal of regime change.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: recent demand samples for chips(Regular) = [217,207,170,131,185] (mean ~182). On-hand=0, in-transit=238 (order from P1 not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time is not confirmed; possible delay but insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This preserves OR engine's standard service-level sizing while the in-transit stock plus upcoming concluded messages will inform future adjustments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (orders from P1=238 and P2=244 still pending). Promised lead time=2. Historical demand samples (environment): [217,207,170,131,185] -> mean=182. I choose default lead time (promised L=2) because concluded messages do not show any arrivals yet and pipeline matches placed orders (no evidence of lost shipments). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost under the promised lead time and current healthy pipeline.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=666, recent concluded periods show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 despite promised L=2, and demand samples show moderate mean (~182). Several consecutive missed-conclude events suggest actual lead time is longer than promised; to protect service level I set lead time explicitly to 3. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend scale demand mean/volatility over the (1+L) review+lead horizon while respecting historical variability. This balances higher safety stock (to cover delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as >=3 periods (evidence: orders placed in Periods 1-3 all show arrived=0 at their expected conclude times under promised L=2)

Daily Reward (R_t): $3198.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=241, in-transit=433. History shows mixed actual lead times (arrivals in Period 4 report lead_time=3 for P1 order and lead_time=1 for P3 order) and earlier expected arrivals were delayed. I choose L=calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures realized variability). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative baseline given limited data and delayed shipments. This balances service (by reflecting longer observed lead times) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3299.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: on-hand=64, in-transit=605. Historical concluded lead times observed: 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4); some later orders remain unarrived by their promised times. Given mixed evidence, use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (217,207,170,131,185) is limited and shows no sustained regime shift, so use default demand forecast and default volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR balance service level vs holding cost. This keeps policy conservative given large in-transit stock while accounting for inferred longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=773. Recent concl. history shows some arrivals with observed lead times of 3 and 1 periods (Period4 conclude), and several orders did not arrive on schedule\u2014evidence of unstable deliveries but no new sustained regime in demand (recent demands: 217,213,163,181,177,193). I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed 3 and 1). Demand parameters use defaults: no clear, sustained demand shift (only short fluctuations), so mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while accounting for inferred lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3591.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand rising (Period5-7 demands =177,193,202) after earlier lower values. On-hand=0, in-transit=646 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 3 periods twice (P1->P4, P4->P7) and one shorter event (P3->P4=1), so use observed-average lead-time approach. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent regime (last 3 periods) where demand is elevated; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility and to keep orders responsive given long/variable lead times and holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P1 order arrived in P4, P4 order arrived in P7; observed lead_times: 3,1,3; sustained 3-period observations)

Daily Reward (R_t): $3406.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand (P4-8 = 181,177,193,202,182) centers ~187 units/period. On-hand=52, in-transit=571 (large pipeline). Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained observations P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine orders for the correct pipeline duration. For demand I use recent_N (N=5: P4-8) to capture the current regime (mean ~187) and scale by (1+L) for review+lead coverage. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability rather than older samples. These choices keep target base stock aligned with the sustained 3-period lead time and recent demand while avoiding over-weighting older data; given large in-transit, this will temper new orders to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=53, in-transit=571. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead-time observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and intermittent 1-periods; shipments have been inconsistent but recent sustained 3-period occurrences justify treating lead time as 3 to avoid stockouts. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect the confirmed longer arrival pattern. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which increases target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead+review window and balances the high profit vs low holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier: P1->P4, P4->P7). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=771. Recent demand (Periods 6-10) averaged 184.6 units; this regime (higher ~180s) is sustained over 5 periods so I use recent_N=5 for demand estimates. Set L explicit=3 to match observed actual lead time so pipeline calculations align with arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the current demand regime across review+lead (1+L=4). sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices ensure the backend targets a base-stock sized for the sustained recent demand while avoiding understating lead time risk from earlier lost/delayed shipments.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 12. Recent demand (Periods 7-11) = [202,182,158,188,186], avg\u2248183.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=793 (large pipeline). History shows multiple concluded lead times of 3 periods (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) \u2014 treat actual lead time as 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed sustained 3-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (last 5 periods avg\u2248183.2); mu_hat therefore targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variation. These choices align reorder coverage for review+lead (4 periods) while recognizing large in-transit inventory; using recent data prevents overreacting to earlier low-demand periods and balances service level vs. holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=201, in-transit=434. Historical concluded lead-times (from conclude messages): 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2 (avg=2.125) \u2014 evidence of mostly 3-period arrivals but some 1\u20132 period variability. No sustained new regime in demand (recent demands: 217,207,170,131,185). I choose to let the backend compute L as the average observed lead time (calculate) so the OR engine incorporates realized lead-time variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given mixed lead-time evidence and current healthy pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=25, in-transit=551. Historical concludes show sustained actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders with lead_time=3 observed). Pipeline is large but deliveries are delayed relative to promised L=2, so set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 158,188,186,158,176) appears stable around ~173; use recent_N=5 to center mu_hat on this recent regime (mu_hat will cover review+lead by backend). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching actual lead time to avoid underordering while using recent demand to limit excess holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=694. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14). Demand history (Periods 1-5 samples) shows stable weekly demand ~182 avg. Because actual lead time is confirmed as 3, set L explicitly=3 so the OR backend forecasts over the correct review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs. holding cost given the updated L. This handles the large in-transit pipeline and avoids under-ordering given longer realized lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=805. Historical demand samples mean=182 (Periods1-5). Multiple conclude messages show variable lead times including repeated 3-period arrivals; average observed lead time ~2.22. Given sizable pipeline and confirmed multi-period delays, use calculate for L (let backend average observed lead times) and default demand/volatility methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples. This keeps decisions consistent with observed lead-time variability while leveraging existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 3 periods from prior conclude messages (arrivals show many L=3). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=688. Recent demand has softened vs earlier peaks; using most recent 5 periods to capture current regime (Periods 12-16 demands = 158,176,162,163,125; recent mean ~156.8) and (1+L)=4 coverage. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the latest regime and keep orders responsive. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for safety stock scaling. These choices aim to cover review+lead demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=41, in-transit=525. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained observations: multiple orders showing 3-period arrivals). To ensure pipeline coverage and account for delayed arrivals I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand over the review+lead horizon using all samples (conservative pooling) and increases safety stock automatically for the longer lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given many in-transit but delayed shipments) versus holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand has settled around ~140\u2013165 units/period (P14\u2013P18 = 162,163,125,124,145). On-hand=0, in-transit=747 (sufficient pipeline but arrival timing uncertain). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods, so I set L=3 explicitly. To capture the most recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses P14\u2013P18). This yields (1+L)-horizon forecasting that responds to the current lower demand and recent volatility while the explicit L=3 guards against assuming the promised L=2 and prevents underordering given observed 3-period arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=747. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Several promised arrivals were delayed to 3 periods, so set explicit lead time=3 to align forecasting with observed arrivals. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=788. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (sustained observations), and several orders delayed or arriving with L=3, so I set L=3 explicitly. Demand has trended around ~150 in the most recent 5 periods (P16\u2013P20); I use recent_N=5 to compute mu_hat as (1+L)\xd7recent mean to capture the current regime (1+L=4 \u2192 forecast \u2248598.4). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility (std\u224823.8 \u2192 sqrt(4)\xd7std\u224847.6). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent demand regime while recognizing the longer confirmed lead time and limiting excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: confirmed long lead times historically (sustained 3-period observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=788 (large pipeline arriving in future). To account for confirmed slower arrivals I set lead time explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes orders over the longer review+lead horizon. Demand samples (periods 1-5) remain representative; I use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the backend compute base-stock while capping order size; this keeps service high given the long lead time while avoiding excess new ordering because substantial pipeline already exists.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=747 units; using L=3 ensures OR engine plans across correct pipeline horizon. I choose L explicit=3 (confirmed actual lead time). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (six most recent periods) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the lower recent demand and its variability, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service. No new sustained pattern beyond confirmed L=3 to record.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: recent history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple concluded lead_time=3 events) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=773 units. Several earlier promised-L=2 orders were delayed consistent with a sustained 3-period lead time. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture full review+lead demand given L=3; use default sigma_hat to scale sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). This ensures the OR backend targets a higher base-stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time while relying on historical demand samples.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Recent demand has fallen vs. early periods; last 5 demands (P23-27) average ~118.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=773 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods (sustained evidence through prior periods). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery behavior so orders account for the longer arrival delay. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime (lower mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to current lower demand while the explicit L prevents under-ordering due to longer realized lead times; large existing in-transit inventory will limit ordering via the backend cap.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=747. Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained 3-period mode (many 3s in recent history) though occasional 1\u20132s exist. I choose L using recent_N to bias toward the recent dominant 3-period lead time (N=7 captures the most recent observed lead-times, producing ~3). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) with holding cost while letting the backend apply its statistical safety stock and cap constraints. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or lead-time shift requiring carry-over update.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=747. Historical concludes show sustained lead time ~3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3; earlier carry-over noted). To ensure pipeline covers the longer effective lead time and to let the OR backend compute demand across review+lead, I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (leveraging full history) to balance service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=763. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed arrivals so the OR engine orders for the correct pipeline horizon. Demand mean over Periods 1\u201330 \u2248155.4; (1+L)=4 so forecasted mu_hat \u22484\xd7155.4\u2248622 units (explicit) to cover four periods of demand. Demand volatility estimated std\u224842 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(4)\xd742 \u224884 (explicit). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time and expected variability, balancing high profit vs low holding cost given large in-transit stock and risk of stockouts if lead time underestimated.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3 across many periods), so actual lead time is sustained at 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals. For demand, historical sample mean (periods provided) is 182; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=3, producing a base-stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while accounting for the longer lead time and large pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_33: recent concluded history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders arriving 3 periods after order), demand samples mean = 173.6 (periods 1-5 mean 182? but full sample mean used by backend). On-hand=0, in-transit=763 \u2014 large pipeline already covers several periods of demand so avoid over-ordering. Set L explicitly to 3 to match observed delivery behavior and prevent understating pipeline; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce a capped order that respects observed variability and existing pipeline. This balances service (using correct lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical conclude messages show multiple 3-period lead time observations (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23) indicating actual lead time \u22483 and occasional lost/delayed shipments. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend plans for (1+L) periods of demand. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full history to stabilize forecasts given intermittent arrivals and large in-transit stock. This combination reduces stockouts from underestimating lead time while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical concludes show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23) \u2014 actual lead time is sustained at 3, longer than promised 2. To ensure pipeline covers the true transit delay, I set L explicit=3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which scales forecasts and safety stock for the longer lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given high profit relative to holding cost.

Historical conclude messages consistently show a 3-period arrival pattern; use L=3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk given large in-transit). These parameters bias orders toward current lower demand while OR backend will still account for promised lead time and variability.

With L=3, (1+L)=4; recent_N mu/sigma will let the OR backend size base-stock to cover four periods of demand while the large in-transit pipeline already provides substantial coverage and reduces risk of stockouts.

Period_40: recent concluded history shows confirmed lead time = 3 periods (sustained observations through Period_8 and later). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=763 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the backend forecasts over the correct replenishment horizon. I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the available demand samples, letting it scale demand and variability appropriately for the 4-period review+lead horizon; this balances service (using observed longer lead time) against holding cost given the sizeable in-transit pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed in prior carry-over evidence). With promised L=2 but confirmed L=3, set L=3 to align forecast horizon. Recent demand has trended lower; using the last 5 periods (Periods 36-40 demands = 113,101,69,111,54) captures the current regime. (1+L)=4 so the backend will scale the recent mean across review+lead. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the forecast and volatility responsive while avoiding overweighting older high-demand spikes. Current pipeline (763) exceeds the 4-period recent expected demand, so this choice avoids unnecessary additional orders and limits holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed P\u2192P+3 arrivals); many earlier promised L=2 shipments were delayed to L=3. To ensure pipeline covers the full review+lead demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (stable demand history provided). This raises target base-stock to cover the extra period of demand and mitigates stockouts given observed 3-period arrivals while keeping volatility estimation unchanged.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical conclude messages show multiple 3-period lead-time observations (sustained earlier through Period 8), and several late/zero arrivals in mid-periods indicating variability in arrivals. To capture the confirmed longer lead-time signal while keeping the backend's averaging, I select L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). Demand has been lower recently (~69\u2013111 range last 5 periods) vs earlier high peaks, so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. This raises responsiveness to current demand while the calculated L accounts for delayed shipments; together they help the OR engine size orders to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand without overstocking given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: e.g. P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12). On-hand=0, in-transit=763 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed relative to promised L=2. To reflect observed sustained lead-time shift and ensure orders cover the extra transit period, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it scale safety stock to the longer effective lead time while capping order size via its cap rule. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long transit) against holding cost since we already have large in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical conclude messages show sustained 3-period arrivals (evidence in history and prior carry-over), so set lead time to 3 to align pipeline. Using L=3 (explicit) ensures the backend computes (1+L)-period demand correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances high service (q=0.95 implied by profit/holding) against holding cost while recognizing confirmed longer lead time and large existing pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period shows On-hand=0, In-transit=763. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders placed earlier arrived 3 periods later). Promised L=2 is stale; set L explicit=3 so OR backend forecasts over correct review+lead horizon. Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift warranting a different demand forecast, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This increases target pipeline to cover one additional period of demand and reduces risk of stockouts given prolonged in-transit volume and observed 3-period lead time.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across review+lead using all samples with updated L; this balances service level (longer lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent demand has been low and stable (~60s over Periods 43\u201347) after earlier higher volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=763 (large pipeline). Historical conclues show actual lead time consistently 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to match observed lead time and avoid underordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands \u2248 4\xd7~61) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. These choices keep target base stock small per low recent demand while ensuring pipeline + order cover the 4-period review+lead demand, and reduce holding cost given the large existing in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (sustained evidence earlier). To reflect observed lead-time behavior I let backend compute average observed lead time from concluded messages. Demand history is volatile but no recent sustained demand regime change is evident, so use default demand/volatility calculations (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples). This balances service level (captures longer observed lead time) against holding cost given high profit:holding ratio.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=763. Historical concludes show confirmed multi-period lead-time drift to 3 periods; recent demand has settled much lower than early-period peaks (sustained lower demands from ~Period_29\u2192Period_49). To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly=3. For demand I use recent_N=20 to forecast across review+lead (captures the low-demand regime from ~P29\u2013P49). I match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N=20) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices keep orders sized for the lower, sustained demand regime while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and the large in-transit balance.
