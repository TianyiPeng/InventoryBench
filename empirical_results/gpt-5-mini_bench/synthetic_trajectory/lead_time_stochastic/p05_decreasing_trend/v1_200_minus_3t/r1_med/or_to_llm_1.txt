Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P20\u2192P23), so actual lead time = 3 (not promised 2). Inventory & demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=615. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201349) averages \u224892 units/period; with observed L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods \u2192 expected demand \u22484\xd792\u2248368 units. Pipeline (615) comfortably exceeds this cover and provides a buffer vs. demand variability, so placing additional order would only add holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $4 only realized upon sale; but excess inventory reduces objective due to holding cost. OR recommended 0 units; given lead time=3 and substantial in-transit volume exceeding the (L+1)-period demand, I follow OR and order 0. Strategy: do not order now; monitor conclude messages to confirm which in-transit batches arrive and whether any shipments are lost (if arrivals do not conclude after expected arrival periods, raise ordering).",
