Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or observed lead-times yet. Use promised lead time (default) since no lead-time evidence. Use default demand stats (mu_hat default and sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available samples (Periods 1-5). This provides a neutral base-stock reflecting historical mean/volatility while avoiding premature adjustments for unobserved shipments or regime shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=238 (order placed P1). Historical samples show moderate demand (217,207,170,131,185). No concluded arrivals yet so no evidence lead time differs from promised 2. Pipeline (238) already covers multiple periods; use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend uses full-sample mean/STD scaled by (1+L). This balances service level given profit/holding costs and avoids overreacting to a single-period observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (matches ordered 238+244). No arrivals have been concluded yet (Period1/2 orders show arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays. Demand history mean=182; with L=2 the backend will compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat using all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting confirmed late-arrival evidence.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=622. Historical concludes show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived=0 (no confirmed arrivals yet). Promised lead time=2; lacking any concluded arrivals we cannot confirm an actual lead time change, so I retain default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (uses all 5 demand samples). This keeps forecasts conservative while the in-transit bulk (622) is expected to cover upcoming demand once/if arrivals are confirmed. Noting missing arrivals influences caution but lacking confirmed lead-time evidence I do not change L or demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have no confirmed arrivals (Period 1-3 concludes: arrived=0 for orders from P1-P3); possible delayed or lost shipments\u2014monitor for confirmation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $527.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=197, in-transit=244, recent concluded arrivals show orders from P1 (238) arrived in P4 with lead_time=3 and orders from P3 (140) arrived in P4 with lead_time=1. This confirms variable lead times but an average near the promised 2. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history (217,207,170,131,185) shows no sustained regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time variability: P1 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=1); average observed lead_time=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $688.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=20, in-transit=480. History shows mixed lead times (P1\u2192P4 = 3, P3\u2192P4 = 1) and one overdue arrival pattern earlier; recent concluded info implies lead-time variability with average \u22482. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-times rather than the promised 2, so the pipeline coverage accounts for actual variability. I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to base demand forecast on all five historical samples (Periods 1-5) scaled by (1+L) computed by backend; this balances service level (captures demand uncertainty) against holding cost given current high in-transit volume and low on-hand.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: recent demand samples mean=182 (samples:217,207,170,131,185). On-hand=0, in-transit=713 \u2014 pipeline already large and should cover the next review+lead demand. Observed concluded lead times: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1 \u2192 average observed lead_time=2, so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (higher effective demand window when L>promised) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume. No single lost-shipment conclusion\u2014defaults keep policy conservative but responsive to observed lead-time evidence.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent concluded history shows intermittent arrivals (lead_times observed 3 and 1 \u2192 avg 2) and several outstanding in-transit orders (792) with on-hand=0. I treat lead time via 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand history mean=182 (samples: 217,207,170,131,185); using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility consistent with chosen L=calculate. This balances service (accounting for observed longer/variable lead times) against holding costs while preserving conservative inventory given many in-transit units and some lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Profit: $728.00, Daily Holding Cost: $133.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $595.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times but average ~2. Historical demands (P4-P8) average ~187; recent demand stable ~180-200. On-hand=133, in-transit=481 (total pipeline+on-hand=614) \u2014 ample coverage but pipeline contains past delayed shipments. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures 1 and 3 period arrivals). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to focus forecast on the most recent stable regime (P4-P8) and avoid older low-demand samples. Use sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These params balance service (accounting for observed lead-time variability) while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed lead_times: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P5->P8=3, P7->P8=1; avg=2).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=653. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times but recent evidence (Period 9 conclude) aligns with promised lead time of 2. Demand history samples mean=182 (periods 1-5). To keep params simple and consistent with promised lead time and OR-engine expectations, use default lead time and default demand estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to cover review+lead demand, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility. This balances service (covering 3 periods of average demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

History shows variable observed lead times (1\u20133) but average ~2; several delayed arrivals earlier but recent concludes confirm lead_time\u22482. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variability vs promised). Demand forecast uses default (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to smooth across limited samples and avoid overreacting to short spikes; sigma uses default to reflect full-sample volatility. These choices balance service (capture longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Several past shipments were delayed/lost but lead time has stabilized around 2. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times, and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost while accounting for the inferred lead-time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Recent demand historically ~170\u2013217 with recent realized demands ~158\u2013193; current on-hand=18, in-transit=544 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 3) with average \u22482 \u2014 use calculated average lead time so OR backend aligns with observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so backend applies full-sample demand estimate while respecting the large in-transit pipeline via its cap. This balances service level (given high pipeline) against holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=678. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead_times (1 and 3) averaging 2 periods \u2014 consistent with prior confirmation. To reflect observed lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will compute avg). Given ample history and no strong sustained demand regime change, use default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (accounting for observed longer/shorter arrivals) versus holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline will be considered by the OR cap.

Demand history (Periods 1\u20135 mean=182) shows no sustained regime shift. Given large in-transit volume and confirmed average lead time \u2248 promised, use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend balances service level with holding cost and avoids over-ordering against the existing pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=624. Recent concludes show a stable alternating lead-time pattern with average \u22482 and prior carry-over confirmed lead_time=2; pipeline (624) already large vs typical demand (~182). Use promised lead time (default=2) to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with contract and historical confirms. For demand forecasting use default methods (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) because available canonical samples (mean=182) are representative and no sustained demand regime shift detected; this balances service level (profit$4 vs holding$1) while avoiding overreacting to intermittent delayed arrivals.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=9, in-transit=490. Historical concluded arrivals show recent consistent 3-period lead times (multiple orders that concluded: P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3). Several earlier lead-time samples were mixed, but the last three observed leads are all 3, indicating a sustained increase. To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but long effective lead, I set L explicitly to 3. Demand samples (Periods 1-5 mean=182) show no sustained shift in demand; use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples). Volatility also use default so backend computes sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This increases coverage for the longer confirmed lead time while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3)

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=698. Recent concluded history shows consistent 3-period arrivals for multiple orders (P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17), so use lead time L=3. Demand sample mean from provided samples = 182 units; (1+L)*mean = 4*182 = 728 => set mu_hat explicit to cover review+lead. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while acknowledging confirmed longer lead time and large pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concludes show recent consistent 3-period arrivals (P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3, P14->P17=3) so actual lead time has trended to 3. I set L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed shift to 3). Demand recent three periods (P16=125, P17=124, P18=145) appear representative of the current regime, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the latest regime. This balances service (use observed longer lead time) vs holding cost by reducing reliance on older samples and reflecting current demand variability. Pipeline (774) is large\u2014using recent demand prevents over-ordering if pipeline already covers upcoming demand under the longer lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concludes show sustained lead-time=3 (P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3); promised=2 but recent evidence supports using L=3 to ensure pipeline covers upcoming demand. Demand in most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) is the best indicator of current regime, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current mean and volatility over the review+lead period and to avoid overreacting to older volatile data. This increases target base-stock to preserve service level given longer lead times while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap rule.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concludes show a sustained pattern of 3-period lead times from Periods 9\u201317 (P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3) so I set lead time to 3. Recent demand has shifted higher: last 5 periods' demands (P16\u2013P20) = [125,124,145,172,182], mean=149.6. With L=3, review+lead = 1+L =4 periods; I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the recent elevated mean and variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given a confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit volume.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concludes show intermittent arrivals with predominant recent pattern of 3-period lead times (confirmed at Period_17). Pipeline is large but arrivals seen with L=3; several prior short (1) arrivals occurred but recent sustained evidence supports using L=3 to avoid under-ordering. Use L explicit=3 so backend's (1+L) horizon matches observed arrivals. Demand history limited to provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/hcost ratio.

To avoid under-ordering given observed 3-period lead time and large pipeline uncertainty, set L explicitly to 3. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to cover the 4-period demand window; use sigma_hat default so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to prioritize service level given long/variable lead times while backend cap limits extreme orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained lead-time shift to 3 periods (multiple orders arriving with 3-period delay). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine plans for a 4-period coverage window. I use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with the chosen L and the full-sample demand history (samples mean=182). This raises target pipeline to protect service level given delayed/lost shipments while the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) tradeoff is handled by the backend's z* calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3).

Historical concludes show consistent 3-period arrivals in recent history (e.g., P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3, P14->P17=3) \u2014 treat actual lead time as 3. Demand has shifted lower recently (Periods 20-24 demands = 182,162,112,130,108); use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) so the OR engine builds base stock for (1+L) periods at the new lower demand and captures recent volatility. This balances service (cover longer confirmed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical arrival pattern shows lead time has been consistently 3 periods since Period_17 and reaffirmed at Period_24 (multiple orders with lead_time=3); several earlier shipments show 1/3 variability but most recent sustained pattern=3. Promised LT=2 appears optimistic; to cover pipeline uncertainty and overdue/lost-shipment risk I set L explicit=3. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)*mean(all samples) to inflate the order-up-to for the longer LT; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to scale safety stock with the longer review+lead window. This increases on-order coverage while the large in-transit quantity (774) will be reconciled when arrivals conclude.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical conclude messages (Periods 12,14,16,17,24) show multiple lead_time=3 observations and sustained pattern since Period 17, so actual lead time appears longer than the promised 2. To let the OR engine use observed lead-time data while keeping demand forecasting simple and robust given limited sample set, I request L=calculate (average observed lead times). For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This increases pipeline coverage to account for the confirmed longer lead times and balances service level vs holding cost by using overall historical demand statistics rather than overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=3 periods (sustained evidence in prior history). To avoid stockouts given long lead time and substantial in-transit but zero on-hand, set L explicitly to 3. Demand has shifted vs initial samples; use recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture current regime for both mean and volatility. Methods: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward covering the longer confirmed lead time while using recent demand to avoid overstock from outdated higher historical means.

LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained lead_time=3 periods (Periods 9->12,11->14,13->16) so use explicit L=3 to reflect observed shipping reality and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio. This setup relies on large in-transit stock (774) to cover upcoming demand while accounting for longer lead time.

Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent longer lead times (multiple observed lead_time=3 events through Period 16) and many subsequent periods with no arrivals suggesting slow/ delayed supply or lost shipments. Given the confirmed shift to 3-period lead times in prior periods, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend orders cover the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while relying on the backend's demand stats.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: promised L=2 but historical concludes show sustained lead_time=3 (Periods 9-17 evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=774 (sufficient pipeline; no immediate extra safety needed). Recent demand has been lower (Periods 27-31: 79,90,89,149,108 -> mean=103). I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed shipping reality. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime and compute demand across review+lead (1+L) periods. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings align the OR backend to higher effective lead time while avoiding overstock given large in-transit inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_33. Recent concluded history shows lead time consistently observed = 3 periods (Periods 9->12,11->14,13->16 evidence earlier); on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Using L=3 (explicit) to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time. With L=3, (1+L)=4 so default mu_hat/sigma_hat (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) is appropriate. In-transit (774) already exceeds the 4-period demand forecast (4\xd7mean\u2248728), so parameters avoid unnecessary extra stock while aligning safety stock to profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical demand samples (seed) mean=182 units. Past conclude messages show persistent multi-period lead times and recent confirmations of 3-period lead time, so set lead time longer than promised to protect service. Set L explicit=3 to cover observed arrivals arriving ~3 periods after ordering. Use mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (captures review+lead demand = 4\xd7mean). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (longer L, higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline; using defaults lets OR engine cap orders appropriately given its cap formula.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: recent history shows long stretches of zero arrivals after Period_16 despite large in-transit (774) \u2014 suggests delivery variability and possible lost shipments, but confirmed lead-time episodes (both 3 and 1) average ~2 historically. On-hand=0 so pipeline must cover current+lead periods. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history average, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead times and the large current in-transit position.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 9,12,14,16,17, etc.) show sustained lead_time=3 confirmed at Period_17 and reiterated through Period_24; therefore set lead time to 3 to capture actual arrival timing and avoid stockouts. Recent demand has downshifted vs early samples; use recent_N (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower, more recent demand regime and reduce overstocks given holding cost. These settings ensure the OR engine targets (1+L)-period coverage using up-to-date mean/volatility while accounting for longer actual lead time and in-transit inventory.

To ensure pipeline covers the review+lead horizon and to let the OR engine recompute using observed lead times, set L via calculate (uses average observed lead times). Demand and volatility will use defaults so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, yielding a base-stock that balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Promised L=2 but evidence supports using L=3 to cover the longer arrival delay and avoid stockouts. I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples\u2014this yields a conservative replenishment covering the extended lead+review horizon while the backend's cap limits prevent extreme overordering.

To account for confirmed longer lead time and avoid stockouts, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (reduce stockouts with longer coverage) against holding cost given sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 3, avg \u22482.2). To account for this variability and possible delayed shipments I use observed lead times average (calculate). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples; this balances service level (captures longer average lead time) vs holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Concluded arrivals show variable historical lead_times (mix of 1 and 3); no new sustained regime change since prior insights. Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history (captures observed variability). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this balances service level (accounts for measured lead-time) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

On-hand=0, in-transit=774 \u2014 ample pipeline inventory so do not accelerate orders. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) based on the full historical demand samples (mean=182) to avoid overfitting to short-term noise. This balances service (accounts for longer-than-promised lead times) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical conclude messages show sustained lead-time=3 (multiple confirmed orders with 3-period arrivals: e.g., P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16) so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized supplier behavior and avoid under-ordering. Given no clear recent demand regime shift (demand varies but no sustained mean change >3 periods), use default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (longer explicit L covers longer pipeline) versus holding cost while the large in-transit volume is present.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times (observed samples: 3,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,1; avg\u22482.1) \u2014 lead time is variable around 2\u20133. Given the variability and confirmed past 3-period episodes, use lead-time 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history available; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR engine compute base_stock while respecting the inferred average lead time. No explicit adjustment to demand or volatility because recent demand samples are limited and not a sustained regime shift. This balances service level (accounting for longer average lead time) against holding cost while large in-transit inventory will reduce ordering by the OR engine.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent demand samples average ~139 (from history). On-hand=0, in-transit=774 \u2014 large pipeline likely includes multiple outstanding shipments (some delayed historically). Several past periods show confirmed lead times of 3 being common; occasional 1-period arrivals occurred but were not sustained. I select L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed history but biases to confirmed multi-period delays). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1 and the large existing pipeline. This keeps ordering conservative while awaiting confirmed arrivals and avoids overstock if many in-transit shipments still arrive.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Recent demands (Periods 36\u201346) are lower and more stable (~69\u2013113, then 61); on-hand=0 but large pipeline=774 units (many prior orders still in-transit). Historical concluded lead-time evidence (carry-over) shows lead time has been 3 periods for many confirmed arrivals -> set L=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=11 covers Periods 36\u201346). These settings instruct the OR engine to size base-stock for a 1+L review+lead window using recent average demand while accounting for observed variability; explicit longer L reduces risk of stockouts given delayed arrivals and the large in-transit volume avoids over-ordering immediately.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=774. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 3 with average ~2.1; recent single 1-period arrival (P39->P40) but multiple 3-period arrivals earlier\u2014no clear sustained shift away from average. Given large pipeline and mixed lead-time evidence, use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt. Use default demand & volatility aggregation ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so OR engine applies full-sample demand estimates across review+lead period. This balances service (using observed avg lead time) vs. holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent concluded history shows persistent variable lead times with multiple 3-period arrivals since Periods 9\u201317, and large pipeline (in-transit=774) with on-hand=0. Given mixed observed lead times but sustained evidence of multi-period (\u22653) delays earlier, set L method to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concluded history. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service-level needs against holding cost while the backend knows promised lead time=2 but will use our L estimate. Current pipeline (774) likely covers upcoming (1+L) demand for L\u2248observed average, so no explicit urgent adjustment to mu_hat; monitor next concludes for confirmed losses or lead-time shifts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_50: recent concluded history shows sustained actual lead_time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals at lead_time=3 earlier), while promised was 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=774 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will arrive with L=3. Set L explicitly to 3 to align ordering horizon with observed arrivals. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), balancing service level and holding cost given large pipeline.
