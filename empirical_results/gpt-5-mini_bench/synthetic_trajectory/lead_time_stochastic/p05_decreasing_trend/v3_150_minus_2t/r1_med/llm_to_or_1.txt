Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) exist; no evidence of a recent regime shift or lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) so backend assumes L=2, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given no new signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=166 (order placed Period_1 has not concluded = arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; cannot assume loss. Use promised lead time (default) and population demand stats (no sustained changepoint: recent demands 130,147,128,116,161 show no clear regime shift). Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=332, two prior orders (Periods 1-2) have not concluded (arrived=0) but no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. I will use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/statistics so the OR engine uses all historical samples (no premature changepoint assumptions). This keeps the backend forecast (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on the full sample set while recognizing potential delayed shipments in the rationale.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=433; concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not arrived (arrived=0 each conclude). This suggests shipments are delayed/lost relative to promised L=2, so I conservatively extend assumed lead time to 3 to allow the OR engine to protect more pipeline. Demand shows no clear recent regime shift (historical samples available); therefore use default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 show arrived=0 in Periods 1-3 concludes (expected by Period 3 under promised L=2); suggests persistent delivery delays.

Daily Profit: $628.00, Daily Holding Cost: $110.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent demand samples average 136.4 units (Periods 1-5). Inventory: on-hand=110, in-transit=306 (pipeline substantial). Concluded arrivals show mixed actual lead times (observed lead_time=3 for P1->P4 and lead_time=1 for P3->P4), so compute L from observed lead times rather than trusting promised value. Use backend defaults for demand forecast and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) and overall sample stats; this balances service level given large pipeline while allowing OR engine to adjust base-stock using observed average lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=471. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (Period_4 conclude: order from P1 arrived with lead_time=3, order from P3 arrived with lead_time=1) and recent orders (Period_5) still unarrived, indicating delivery variability but not a sustained lead-time shift. Demand samples (130,147,128,116,161) show no clear sustained regime change. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' to leverage all samples for (1+L)-period demand and volatility estimates, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_7. On-hand=0, in-transit=581. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: one order (P1\u2192P4) had lead_time=3, another (P3\u2192P4) had lead_time=1; use the average observed lead time to reflect this variability. I select L=calculate to have the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1 and 3 \u2192 avg 2). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline replenishment that accounts for the longer effective replenishment window while avoiding overfitting to a short noisy sample. This balances service (by inflating the review+lead demand for L\u22482) versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory and prior delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=441. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_4 (lead_time=3) and Period_4 arrived in Period_7 (lead_time=3) \u2014 persistent actual lead time longer than promised. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delivery timing so the OR engine sizes pipeline appropriately. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and limited evidence of a durable demand regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192arrived P7).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=19, in-transit=421. Historical concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) and one 1-period arrival (P3\u2192P4); average observed lead-time > promised. Some earlier shipments were delayed/missing but recent pattern is predominantly 3. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures shift toward 3). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples\u2014this balances service vs. holding cost given increased inferred lead time and large in-transit pipeline. Current parameters aim to avoid stockouts from extended lead times while not over-increasing safety stock unnecessarily.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: On-hand=54, in-transit=423. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7); several earlier shipments were delayed/lost. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend orders against a 3-period lead. Demand samples mean=136.4; using (1+L)=4 gives forecasted mu_hat=4\xd7136.4=545.6 (explicit) to cover review+lead demand. I keep sigma_hat as default so backend computes volatility = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given increased lead time and observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demand (P6\u2013P10 = 114,165,146,110,133; mean=133.6) shows no strong upward spike; on-hand=0, in-transit=522 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time \u22483 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and intermittent lost/late arrivals earlier. To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly=3. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat based on recent volatility; this balances service (longer L needs more pipeline cover) against holding costs given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=573. History shows highly variable actual lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 avg 2.2) and repeated delayed shipments (orders often arrive well after promised L=2). I set L via recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent lead-time evidence and let the backend average the last 5 observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent demand regime samples. sigma_hat is default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to let the backend scale variability with the chosen L. These choices bias target base-stock upward vs. promised L=2 to cover the observed longer/variable lead times while using recent demand to avoid overstock from old data; they rely on the backend cap to prevent extreme orders.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 start: on-hand=106, in-transit=327. History shows variable actual lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) alongside occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals, and several delayed/missing arrivals earlier. To capture the observed lead-time variability I request the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method: calculate). Demand forecast and uncertainty will use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock and cap logic while accounting for the chosen L. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost given current on-hand and substantial in-transit volume.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=428. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with a recent modal/mean near 3; last 7 observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,3,2], recent 5 average = 2.4. Recent demand (Periods 9-13) = [110,133,146,140,127], recent mean=131.2. To be responsive to the recent lead-time regime and demand, I set L by averaging the last 5 observed lead times (captures recent 3-period delays while smoothing occasional 1-2 period cases). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples (recent_N, N=5) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=444. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time signal (multiple orders observed with W=3, most recently P11\u2192P14), so I set L explicitly to 3 to capture the realized delay and avoid underordering. Demand samples (Periods 1-5 mean=136.4) are unchanged; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=3, ensuring the base-stock and cap account for the longer lead time and balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1). This approach hedges against lost/delayed shipments by increasing coverage for the extra lead period while relying on historical demand stats for variability.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical conclude messages show multiple lead_time=3 observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14) plus some 1\u20132 period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.38. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 146,140,127,140,117) has mean 134. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed lead-time average from concluded arrivals (captures mixed 1\u20133 delays). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest regime (Periods 11\u201315 mean=134); same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (accounting for observed longer lead times) against holding cost by relying on recent demand samples rather than long-run averages.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=475. History shows repeated 3-period arrivals recently (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16) with occasional shorter arrivals; recent observed lead times average ~2.4 so I use recent_N for L to capture the current slower regime. Demand has been stable in the last 5 periods (P12\u2013P16 mean \u2248129.8); I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L) forecast and volatility reflect the most recent regime and mitigate stockouts from delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 18. On-hand=0, in-transit=417. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time in recent history (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations), and recent demand has averaged ~121 units (Periods 13-17). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed/consistent 3-period actual lead time so the OR backend sizes pipeline to cover the longer realized delay. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 13-17 mean ~121) and scale by (1+L) internally; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given extended lead time) while limiting exposure to outdated older samples.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=512. To account for sustained LT=3 I set L explicit=3 so the OR backend plans for (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Demand has been stable recently with lower mean than early periods (most recent 5 demands: P14-P18 = 140,117,125,98,114), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest regime and avoid overstock while pipeline fills.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=512.

Use calculate for L so backend sets lead time to the observed-average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand across (1+L) periods is computed from all samples (scales forecast and volatility up for longer lead time), which raises base-stock to cover the longer pipeline and mitigates stockouts from delayed/lost shipments.

Recent demand (Periods 16-20 = 125,98,114,128,117) averages 116.4. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend plans over the correct pipeline horizon. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (1+L=4 review+lead \u2192 4\xd7116.4\u2248465.6 forecast) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These choices aim to ensure ordered quantity covers the longer actual lead time while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: recent history shows frequent 3-period actual lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3), demand samples steady (mean from Periods 1-5 = 136.4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=520 (large pipeline). Several past orders were delayed but many later arrived with lead_time=3. I set L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times (will capture the confirmed 3-period reality). For demand and volatility I use default methods so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit and confirmed longer lead time.

To cover review+lead demand while the backend expects promised L=2, I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (robust to noise) while the explicit L forces higher pipeline coverage to mitigate overdue shipments and reduce stockouts despite holding cost.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine plans across the correct pipeline span. Demand has trended down in recent periods (P20\u2013P24 demands = 117,106,101,79,86); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, keeping ordering responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for the longer lead time and existing large in-transit volume.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (many P\u2192P+3 observations) with intermittent 1-2 period cases and several lost/delayed arrivals earlier. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the persistent drift to ~3). For demand parameters I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting it incorporate the computed L and historical demand (Period_1-5 samples: 130,147,128,116,161 and later periods). This balances service level vs holding cost by increasing coverage when calculated lead time > promised while relying on full-sample demand estimates given no recent sustained demand regime shift.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. History shows many delayed/variable arrivals with observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2} (avg\u22482.54) and repeated late arrivals/lost signals. Set L using calculate to let backend use observed average lead time rather than the promised 2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that accounts for longer effective lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent noise. This balances service (profit>holding) given frequent delivery delays and current zero on-hand with sizable pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_29. On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (many P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and multiple delayed/lost shipments earlier; recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 86,127,134,99,69) averages ~103 units. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed 3-period lead time observed in concludes. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower-demand regime: mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean(last5)=4*103\u2248412. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias the OR engine to hold safety stock for the longer confirmed lead time while using recent demand to avoid overstock given falling demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concludes show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and many delayed shipments; treat actual lead time as 3. Recent demand has fallen (Periods 25-29 demands = 127,134,99,69,63), indicating a lower recent regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so pipeline coverage matches reality. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 (captures mean of last 5 periods, (1+L) coverage applied by backend) and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent reduced demand volatility. This balances service (accounting for longer LT) while avoiding excess holding given lower recent demand and positive holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using all available samples; this balances service level (higher L raises (1+L) demand forecast) against holding cost given large in-transit stock. These settings are robust to delayed/lost shipments and let OR cap orders via its internal cap.

To reflect realized delivery behavior I set L via 'calculate' (average of all observed lead times) so the OR engine inflates pipeline coverage. Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service (accounting for longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Recent concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirmations), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=516. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained longer lead time. Demand has declined in recent periods (Period_28\u201332 demands = 69, 63, 108, 104, 85); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given high holding cost. This balances service (accounting for L=3 pipeline) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from the latest demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_34. On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Expect incoming pipeline to arrive with L\u22483; several earlier prolonged zero-arrival stretches suggest delayed fulfillment rather than demand collapse. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delivery timing so the backend sizes orders to cover the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, balancing higher safety stock for longer L against holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

History shows persistent delivery delays and multiple observed lead times of 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12) \u2014 actual lead time appears sustained at 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed operational reality so the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. Demand has been lower in recent periods; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demand observations: Periods 30\u201334) to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduce overstocking given holding cost. These choices steer the backend to order for a 4-period coverage ((1+L)=4) based on the most recent demand signal while acknowledging the confirmed longer lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

To reflect persistent longer transit and protect service, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend uses full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) given no clear recent sustained demand regime change. This raises target base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while letting OR engine compute safety stock from full-history variability.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concludes show repeated lead times of 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23, P23\u2192P25, P34\u2192P36) and many earlier delayed/missing arrivals. I therefore let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes to capture the true realized lead time (method: calculate). For demand forecasting and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples respectively; this leverages all historical demand data while letting L reflect realized delays. These choices bias orders upward to cover the longer effective pipeline due to persistent 3-period delays while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

History shows multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16), so set L explicit=3 to reflect persistent 3-period lead time. Recent demand (Periods 33\u201337 = 95, 107, 124, 86, 74) is lower and more variable than early samples; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current regime. This raises pipeline coverage for the 1+L window while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility, balancing service (profit $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit/period.

Given persistent variability and multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier, set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level and holding cost without overfitting short-term noise. The large in-transit volume reduces urgent ordering pressure this period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with many 3-period observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23) plus occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals. Average observed lead time \u2248 2.42 periods, so I set L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average. Demand seed samples are the provided five-period series (mean=136.4); I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost while accounting for the longer inferred lead time. This handles overdue/in-transit inventory by increasing the review+lead demand forecast without manually inflating safety stock here.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent demand has softened (recent 5-period mean \u224867 units) versus earlier higher demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=516 (large pipeline, some shipments historically delayed). Many concluded lead-times cluster at 3 periods recently. I set L using a recent_N average of the last 5 observed lead-times to bias toward the more common 3-period delays (captures recent delivery slowdowns). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the lower recent demand regime (gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled forecast and reduced variability), while relying on the backend caps to limit order size given large in-transit inventory. This balances service versus holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1 per unit.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=516; history shows frequent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16) indicating sustained lead-time=3 vs promised 2 and many overdue shipments. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from the full sample history; this balances service (accounting for longer lead time) versus holding cost rather than relying on short recent windows which could overreact to volatile short-term demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: demand has trended lower than early-period highs; on-hand=0, in-transit=516 which likely covers multiple future periods. History shows persistent delivery delays and confirmed 3-period arrivals in earlier windows, so use observed lead-time data rather than promised. Select calculated L (average of observed lead times) so backend accounts for actual delivery behavior; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand samples show lower mean (~100s) than early periods; pipeline has 516 units in-transit and on-hand=0. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (many 3-period observations); average observed lead time exceeds promised 2. To account for uncertain/lengthened lead time while letting the OR backend recompute formally, I set L to 'calculate' (use observed average). Use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so estimates reflect all historical data and the chosen L. This balances service (captures longer empirical lead time) vs holding cost by letting backend compute base stock with profit/(profit+holding) service target.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals with some 1-2 period variance; average observed lead time \u22482.46. Several past multi-period delays/lost-arrival patterns noted, so use observed-average lead time to capture real delivery behavior. Leave demand forecast and volatility to backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so they scale with the inferred L and full demand history. This balances service (accounting for longer effective L) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent demand has been running low for many periods (Periods 37-45 demand series: 74,40,73,63,58,63,61,79,55 \u2014 sustained lower regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=516 (covers multiple periods). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time ~3 periods. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and confirmed longer lead time, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 9 periods (the detected sustained lower-demand regime). This reduces overstock risk while the explicit L=3 accounts for delayed arrivals so the OR backend orders enough pipeline to cover the longer lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concludes show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3); pipeline is large versus recent demand so risk of overstock is moderate. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand has down-shifted recently; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the newest low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given long lead times and holding cost.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect sustained 3-period deliveries so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (conservative pooling) \u2014 this balances service level (captures longer coverage window) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods ~29-48) is lower and stable versus initial high-volume periods, so use a recent-sample demand estimate to avoid overstocking. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (stable ~30\u2013120 range over last 20 periods). This reduces target base-stock relative to long-run mean and limits holding cost while preserving service given long lead times and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concludes show repeated delivery delays and multiple observed lead times of 3 periods (orders arriving 3 periods after placement). Recent demand (Periods 45-49) is substantially lower than early-sample mean; I therefore (1) set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect persistent 3-period arrivals, (2) set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the last 5 periods' lower demand, and (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent reduced volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given long effective lead time and lower recent demand while preserving service from the sizeable in-transit pipeline.
