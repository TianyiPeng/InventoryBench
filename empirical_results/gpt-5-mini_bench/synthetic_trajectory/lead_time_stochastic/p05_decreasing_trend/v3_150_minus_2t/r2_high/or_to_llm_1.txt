  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over insight (Period 9) already confirms actual lead time = 3 periods. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 596 units\u2014substantial pipeline that will cover many periods of demand. Demand assessment: recent concluded demands (Periods 45\u201349: 31,43,63,72,59) are modest relative to the large pipeline; ordering more now would primarily increase holding cost. Profit vs holding: profit per unit = $19 >> holding $1/period, but the objective includes holding cost on ending inventory; with 596 units already in transit, marginal benefit from additional orders is minimal and likely negative after holding costs. OR recommended 0 units based on historical demand and promised lead time; given confirmed longer lead time and heavy pipeline, I follow OR and place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost and potential overstock. Strategy: order 0 to let in-transit shipments arrive and satisfy demand; monitor concluded arrivals to detect lost shipments or regime shifts and only reorder if pipeline proves insufficient.",
