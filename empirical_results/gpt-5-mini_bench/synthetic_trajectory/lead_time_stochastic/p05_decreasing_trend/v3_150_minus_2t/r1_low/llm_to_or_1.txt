Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) available: mean = (130+147+128+116+161)/5 = 136.4. Promised lead time = 2 periods. Given equal profit and holding cost (q = 0.5) and no evidence of demand/lead-time regime change, use defaults so backend computes base_stock and caps using full-sample mean and std. This keeps parameters conservative until we observe concluded arrivals or sustained demand shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=166 (Period_1 order showed arrived=0 but promised lead time=2 so arrival not yet due). Use default lead time (promised=2) because no concluded arrivals have contradicted it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples; this balances service vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). No strong evidence of demand or lead-time regime change yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Observed concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132; on-hand=0, in-transit=332 (166+166). No concluded arrival yet, so insufficient evidence to change promised lead time (promised L=2). Demand historical samples (130,147,128,116,161) show no sustained regime shift (only 5 baseline samples). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters conservative given in-transit shortfall versus expected (1+L)-period demand and balances service level vs holding cost until arrivals are observed/concluded.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: promised L=2 but no arrivals observed in Periods 1\u20133 conclude despite in-transit=409 (orders 166+166+77). This indicates actual lead time likely longer than promised or shipments delayed/lost. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative (cover additional delay). Demand history (all samples mean = 136.4) used by backend with (1+L) multiplier; I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L, which raises target base-stock to cover the longer lead-time while the capped order limit still prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2 periods: orders placed P1=166, P2=166, P3=77 (total 409) remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period_3 conclude, indicating sustained delays.

Daily Profit: $157.00, Daily Holding Cost: $86.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1\u2192arrived P4: lead_time=3; P3\u2192arrived P4: lead_time=1). On-hand=86, in-transit=305 (matches orders P2=166 and P4=139 still outstanding) \u2014 evidence of delayed/variable lead times and at least one shipment arriving with lead_time=3. I choose L using recent_N (N=2) to let the backend average the two observed lead times and adapt to current variability. For demand sizing and risk, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while letting the OR engine apply the capped ordering rule given the inferred lead time. This approach is robust to the observed delayed shipments while avoiding overfitting to very recent noise.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=470, recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (W=3 for P1 arrival, W=1 for P3 arrival). Observed lead times = {3,1} \u2192 average 2. Pipeline large and shipments delayed historically; choose lead-time estimate derived from observed data so backend accounts for realized delay. Use default demand and volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given L derived above. This balances service (captures longer effective lead time) versus holding cost by letting OR engine set base-stock using observed demand stats and the calculated L.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=556. History shows mixed lead times with at least one confirmed long arrival (order on P1 arrived with lead_time=3) and another short (P3\u2192lead_time=1); average observed lead time is the best current estimate. Pipeline (556) plus expected arrivals likely covers upcoming demand, so use observed-average lead time to let backend adjust base-stock for actual delays while using full-sample demand stats to avoid overfitting to short-term noise. Methods chosen: L by calculate to capture average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, giving stable forecasts and appropriate safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=417. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W={3,1,3}); average lead time exceeds promised 2. To account for actual lead-time variability I choose L="calculate" so backend uses observed average lead time. Recent demand has been volatile but elevated vs the 5-sample prior; I use mu_hat="recent_N" with N=5 to let the backend weight the most recent 5 demand observations when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I keep sigma_hat="default" (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to provide a baseline volatility estimate. These choices let the OR engine raise target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and recent demand while using default volatility to avoid overreacting to single-period spikes. On-hand + in-transit (417) appears sufficient to cover multiple periods but longer lead times warrant maintaining higher pipeline coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=19, in-transit=407. Concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (orders: P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Because shipments are delayed relative to the promised 2, I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. Demand has recently averaged ~115\u2013165 (last 3 periods: 114,165,146 \u2192 mean\u2248141.7). To cover the review+lead horizon (1+L=4) while keeping responsiveness to recent demand, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 so backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples. Demand volatility also appears elevated recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent std. These choices increase target pipeline to avoid stockouts given confirmed longer lead time while letting the OR cap limit excessive orders to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived Period 4; order on Period 4 arrived Period 7; order on Period 5 arrived Period 8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent history shows confirmed longer lead time (3 periods) with demand mean \u2248136.4 over 5 samples. On-hand=64, in-transit=393 (pipeline healthy but past delays occurred). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and guard against further delayed arrivals. I choose mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so the backend forecasts over the 4-period review+lead horizon given the longer L. I choose sigma_hat default so the backend uses the full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings prioritize service (profit=holding so equal tradeoff) while accounting for observed lead-time stretch and available pipeline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=486. Recent conclude messages show multiple orders arriving with 3-period delays (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) though some 1-period arrivals occurred; overall evidence supports longer-than-promised lead times. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed conclude lead times (captures mixed but biased-toward-3 pattern). For demand forecasting and uncertainty I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given elevated pipeline and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=515. History shows confirmed lead time=3 (arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Demand recent 5 periods (P7\u2013P11) = [165,146,110,133,146], mean=140. To cover review+lead (1+L=4) periods and reflect recent demand regime, set L explicit=3, mu_hat using recent_N over last 5 periods, and sigma_hat using recent_N over last 5 periods. This raises target inventory to meet higher realized lead time while using recent demand to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=94, in-transit=326. Historical concludes show multiple orders arriving with 3-period delays (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) establishing lead time = 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid underordering due to prior 2-period promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). This preserves the OR engine's statistical base while correcting lead-time mismatch to mitigate stockouts from lost/delayed shipments.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=458. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) and occasional shorter arrivals. To be conservative vs. delayed shipments I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across review+lead using all available samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balances service level (covers multi-period demand given longer observed lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit position.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=521. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period delays with occasional 1\u20132; recent sequence supports mean >2. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent lead-time behavior (captures the persistent 3-period delays). Demand forecasting uses default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using its full sample stats. These choices raise the review+lead demand estimate to cover the longer recent lead times while keeping sigma from recent-sample noise, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent history shows multiple confirmed lead-time=3 observations (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15). On-hand=0, in-transit=476 (large pipeline consistent with long lead time). I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained actual lead time. For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and unchanged demand samples.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3). On-hand is low (7) with large in-transit (414) and demand history variable; to reflect the sustained longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend orders cover the longer pipeline. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute demand across the review+lead period from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting to recent noise or transient arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent demand center ~136 units/period (historical samples). On-hand=71, in-transit=375 (total pipeline=446) which is slightly below (1+L)*mean demand if L=3 (4\xd7136\u2248545). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Use default demand estimators so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed higher lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=466; recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed with 3-period delays). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time (avoids under-ordering). Demand has been stable recently (Periods 14-18 demands = 140,117,125,98,114; recent mean \u2248118.8), so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L=4 periods). This biases ordering toward meeting short-term demand spikes while not overreacting to older data; using recent statistics helps the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost under the longer confirmed lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20. On-hand=0, in-transit=476. Historical conclude messages (multiple orders arriving after 3 periods) confirm actual lead time = 3; many shipments showed 3-period delays. To ensure pipeline covers the longer arrival lag, set L explicit=3. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting backend produce base-stock that balances profit vs holding given the longer lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=533. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3 observed), so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized supply delay. Demand history shows no sustained recent mean shift (typical demand ~120\u2013150), so use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat allowing the OR backend to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This increases pipeline coverage to match the longer lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown historically average ~140) suggest steady weekly demand ~130\u2013160. On-hand=0, in-transit=533 \u2014 large pipeline exists but arrivals have historically been delayed (actual lead time observed = 3). Several past orders arrived with 3-period lead time; some arrivals also showed variability. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed longer delivery lag, I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it size base-stock using the adjusted lead time while keeping demand estimates anchored to full history. This balances service (accounting for confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=533. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3), and several earlier delays/losses occurred but recent pattern is stable. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine forecasts over the correct horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a baseline demand forecast scaled to the 4-period review+lead horizon. This approach ensures orders cover the longer observed pipeline while relying on sample-based uncertainty for safety stock.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: On-hand=0, In-transit=476. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 3 periods). Pipeline is large but arrival confirmations lag by one period; given confirmed LT=3 I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has moderated recently after earlier spikes; to adapt to the most recent regime and avoid overstock I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent demand while the explicit L prevents underordering due to earlier promised-L mismatch.

I set L=calculate to let the backend use the observed average lead time. Demand parameters use default (all-sample mean & std scaled by 1+L) to avoid overreacting to short-term noise given limited recent consistent demand shifts; this balances service level (by increasing pipeline for longer L) against holding cost.

To account for the confirmed longer lead time and historical demand variability, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes the review+lead demand window correctly. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a balanced base-stock given profit=holding cost and the observed in-transit backlog.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3), so actual lead time is longer than promised. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed, preventing under-ordering. Demand has moderated recently (Periods 22-26 average \u2248105.4); using recent_N=5 for mu_hat gives (1+L)\xd7mean_recent = 4\xd7105.4 \u2248 421.6, which targets cover for review+lead horizon while reacting to the latest regime. I set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing. These choices raise target pipeline to match observed lead time and recent demand, reducing stockouts from delayed shipments while avoiding excessive holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical conclues show consistent actual lead time \u22483 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). Demand has been lower in recent periods (Periods 23-27: 79,86,127,134,99; recent mean ~105). I set L to be calculated so the backend uses observed lead-time history (confirms actual > promised). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching ordering to the confirmed longer lead time while avoiding overstock from older higher-demand periods; using recent samples reduces holding cost risk given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent demand (Periods 24-28) = [86,127,134,99,69] averaging ~103 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=476 (multiple past delayed shipments). Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period delays with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; last observed lead times = [3,3,1,3,2] (avg 2.4). To be responsive to recent lead-time variability while prioritizing service, I set L using a recent_N average (N=5) to reflect the ~2.4-period realized lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so the (1+L) scaling uses the most recent regime (lower recent demand vs earlier periods). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance holding cost vs stockouts given large in-transit volume and confirmed past 3-period delays.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 snapshot: recent concluded history shows confirmed prolonged lead time = 3 periods (several orders observed arriving after 3 periods) and on-hand=0, in-transit=476. Given confirmed LT=3 I set L explicitly to 3. Demand baseline: historical sample mean = 136.4 (samples:130,147,128,116,161). For review+lead (1+L)=4, mu_hat = 4 * 136.4 = 545.6 (explicit) to cover expected 4-period demand. Sample std = 15.78; sigma_hat = sqrt(4)*15.78 = 31.56 (explicit) to reflect observed variability over the 4-period horizon. These parameters raise target base-stock to account for the longer confirmed lead time and large in-transit backlog, mitigating stockouts from lost/delayed shipments while balancing holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=546, recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (many orders with lead_time=3) though some 1\u20132 period observations exist. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (~2.38), reflecting sustained delays vs promised 2. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean_demand and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to full history while accounting for longer effective lead time and current large in-transit position). This balances service level (higher L increases base stock) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and mixed arrival history.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown historically) average ~ 140/unit per period. Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 546 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence in history P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Several earlier orders were delayed or lost but recent pattern shows stable 3-period lead time. I therefore let the backend compute an empirical lead time average ('calculate') so OR uses observed lead times; use default demand sizing and volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so orders will be sized against the full review+lead demand and current large pipeline. This balances service (accounting for confirmed L\u22483) while avoiding extra explicit overstocking since in-transit already covers multiple periods of demand.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). To ensure the OR engine plans against the observed delay I set L explicit=3. Demand shows no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (longer observed lead time) versus holding cost by forcing higher pipeline coverage while relying on historical demand stats for sizing.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Given large pipeline and confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so backend forecasts demand over correct (1+L) horizon; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, avoiding manual scaling errors. This balances service (accounting for longer LT) against holding cost since substantial in-transit inventory already exists.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical concludes (Period_34 and earlier) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. With profit=holding, service tradeoff favors matching multi-period demand given long LT; in-transit (~546) already roughly covers (1+L)\u22484 periods of demand (sample mean ~136). Set L explicitly to 3 so backend sizes mu_hat and sigma_hat for the 4-period review+lead; use default demand/statistics so OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and balances fill rate vs holding cost.

To protect service while accounting for confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples, which scales forecasts and uncertainty appropriately for the 4-period exposure window and balances profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1). This addresses delayed/lost shipment risk by increasing pipeline cover for the longer observed lead time.

On-hand=0, in-transit=546 (large pipeline). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 3-period lead). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which scales forecast and variability for the longer lead+review horizon and balances service vs holding cost given equal profit/holding costs.

Choose L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Demand recently averages ~97.2 units/period (Periods 33-37); with review+lead (1+L)=4, set mu_hat explicit=389 to cover expected 4-period demand. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from full sample set. This combination prioritizes service (higher mu_hat) given long lead times and avoids further stockouts while letting OR cap limit excessive orders.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the recent lower-demand regime. This keeps the base-stock responsive (lower target) while pipeline (546) already covers multiple review+lead periods, reducing recommended order quantities and holding risk.

Period_40 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical conclude messages (Period_4,9,12,23,28,34) repeatedly show orders arriving 3 periods after ordering; lead time = 3 is a sustained pattern. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (capturing the confirmed 3-period lead). With longer lead confirmed, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to cover the review+lead horizon and the default volatility scaling. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical conclude messages consistently show many 3-period lead times (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, etc.) with occasional 1\u20132 period exceptions; average observed lead time \u22482.38 but modal/confirmed behavior is 3. To avoid stockouts given large in-transit volume and confirmed multi-period delays, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of provided demand samples) and default sigma to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using its historical-demand formulas. This balances service (accounting for observed 3-period delays) against holding cost while relying on the backend's statistical aggregation.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Recent observed lead times show a dominant 3-period lead (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, etc.); pipeline=546 units, on-hand=0 (large in-transit). Demand has fallen recently (last 5 period demands: P37-P41 = 74,40,73,63,58). I set L to 'calculate' so backend will use the empirical average lead time from all concluded arrivals (captures observed 3-period mode). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent lower-demand regime: mu_hat uses the mean of the last 5 observed demands scaled by (1+L) to target coverage across review+lead; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders sized to cover the shorter recent demand level while acknowledging prolonged lead times and the large existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering and high holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand has fallen materially (last 5 demands: P38-42 = 40,73,63,58,63; mean \u224859.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=546 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show sustained lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed arrivals with W=3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand periods) to capture the current lower-demand regime; (1+L)=4 will be applied by backend to scale the forecast across review+lead. Using recent data reduces over-ordering given the large in-transit volume and high holding cost (holding cost equals profit), balancing service level vs holding risk.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 44. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (multiple orders with lead_time=3 across Periods 4,7,8,12,14,15,16,17,23,34) despite promised L=2; pipeline is large (in-transit=546) and on-hand=0. To capture actual delivery behavior I request the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). Demand history (5 samples given plus longer series) will be handled by the backend using default (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to produce mu_hat and sigma_hat; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the large in-transit inventory reduces need for aggressive ordering. This balances service level (use confirmed longer lead times) versus holding cost (large pipeline -> avoid increasing target stock).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (confirmed at Periods 9 and 34) and many delayed shipments; treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid underordering. Set L explicitly to 3 so mu_hat/sigma_hat (default) use (1+L) review+lead horizon; defaults use all samples to keep forecast stable given noisy recent zero arrivals. This captures the sustained 3-period lead time and lets the OR engine compute base stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand, reducing stockouts from delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=546 (large pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals with W=3). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and ensure orders cover the longer pipeline delay. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 4\xd7mean demand (uses all historical samples) to cover four-period exposure; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to scale variability for the 4-period horizon. This combination prioritizes service (avoid stockouts given long lead time and large in-transit) while the OR engine's cap will limit excessive ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical concluded arrivals strongly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3). Demand history (sample set) shows moderate average demand; given confirmed LT=3 I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes the (1+L) review+lead demand correctly. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples; this balances service level (accounting for the longer confirmed lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging many in-transit units and potential past delays.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12), so I let the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). With lead time inferred from history, use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using full sample set. This respects observed LT behavior while letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed observations). Recent demand has fallen vs early periods; last 5 demands (P44\u2013P48) average ~58 units. To respect observed lead time delays and recent low-demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans over the correct review+lead horizon. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecast and uncertainty reflect the most recent lower-demand regime (backend will scale by 1+L). This reduces excess holding from large in-transit while preserving service given delayed arrivals.

Given strong, sustained evidence of LT=3 and large in-transit stock, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans across the correct review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages the full historical sample while the explicit L corrects for observed lead-time mismatch and avoids overfitting recent low-demand noise.
