However this is a single instance and not 3+ periods of consistent evidence, so do not change the baseline assumed lead time (keep promised L=2) per carry-over rules.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand & OR baseline check: Historical single-period mean \u03bc\u0304 = (130+147+128+116+161)/5 = 136.4, sample std \u2248 17.64.

There is evidence of at least one delayed shipment (P1 \u2192 lead_time=3), so some arrival risk exists for the large in-transit 269 (ordered Period 2). However that risk is not yet sustained enough to override OR's use of promised lead time.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final strategy: Follow the OR recommendation of 117 units. Rationale: OR already accounts for demand variability and caps orders to limit swings; current pipeline+on-hand is large but OR's base-stock gap (\u2248112) remains. Ordering 117 balances service (avoid stockouts if promised L holds) while avoiding excessive additional holding cost given already-large pipeline.
