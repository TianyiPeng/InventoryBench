Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=604. OR recommends 0. Past concluded messages (carry-over) show actual lead time = 3 periods. With promised L=2 and actual L=3, an order placed in Period 50 would arrive in Period 53 (after game end) and thus cannot be used to meet any remaining demand. Large existing in-transit (604) likely includes outstanding deliveries that will conclude in future periods; placing new orders risks only incurring holding cost if they eventually arrive before or at game end, but given lead time they will not. Decision: place 0 units. This avoids purchasing units that cannot be sold within the remaining horizon and prevents unnecessary holding cost. I follow OR's zero recommendation because of the long actual lead time and that new orders won't arrive in time to generate profit.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's 0 units: actual lead time is 3 periods so any new order now would arrive after the horizon and cannot be sold; avoid unnecessary holding cost.",
