Using initial samples from train.csv: /shared/share_malatown/OR-Agent-GPT5mini-benchmark/examples/benchmark/synthetic_trajectory/lead_time_stochastic/p09_temp_spike_dip/v1_temp_surge/r2_med/train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 131), ('Period_2', 92), ('Period_3', 118), ('Period_4', 125), ('Period_5', 106)]
  Mean: 114.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No arrivals or conclude history to infer lead time; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (2) and the full-sample demand stats (mean=114.4 over 5 samples) so mu_hat defaults to (1+L)*mean to cover current+lead periods. Variability estimated from full-sample std to let OR set safety stock; default sigma_hat used. This conservative default balances service level (avoid stockouts with zero on-hand/in-transit) against holding cost given modest holding=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=141, no concluded arrivals yet (Period_1 conclude shows ordered=141 arrived=0). No observed lead-time confirmations or sustained demand regime change in concluded history. Use promised lead time default and demand/volatility defaults based on all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample estimates while preserving safety against possible lost shipments by relying on pipeline_in-transit in decision logic.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=296 (141+155 from P1/P2). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer a lead-time change. Use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats. This keeps ordering aligned with historical demand while recognizing existing pipeline inventory will be counted by the OR engine.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=366 (orders from Periods 1-3). No concluded arrivals yet (Periods 1-3 concluded with arrived=0), so actual lead time is not confirmed \u2014 shipments appear delayed but not yet proven lost. Use promised lead time (default L=2) so OR backend assumes standard lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample stats) to let the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from historical demand samples, providing a stable forecast while we await arrival confirmations. This balances service (cover multiple periods of demand given large in-transit) against holding cost while we avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders from Periods 1-3 totaling 366 units have not concluded by Period_4 (arrived=0 for P1-P3).

Daily Profit: $520.00, Daily Holding Cost: $81.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Context: on-hand=81, in-transit=155. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period1 order arrived with lead_time=3 (arrived in P4), Period3 order arrived with lead_time=1; Period2 order remains unconfirmed (missing/delayed). Given limited but concrete lead-time observations, use calculated average lead time to let the backend reconcile promised vs observed variability. Demand history (periods 1-5 samples) is stable; use default demand aggregation to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples. These choices keep parameters conservative (back-end base-stock uses observed L, mean, and std) and avoid overfitting to the small recent sample while accounting for demonstrated lead-time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=310 (these correspond to orders from Periods 2 and 5 that have not yet concluded). Concluded arrivals show variable lead times: Period1\u2192arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), Period3\u2192arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). Recent observed lead times average 2, matching the promised 2, so set L to recent_N with N=2 to reflect observed variability but remain conservative. Demand history (P1-P5 = 46,131,87,130,105) yields mean ~99.8; using default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) keeps the OR engine aligned with full-sample demand estimate and matches current in-transit volume (~310). Use default sigma_hat to supply the backend with the full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (covering (1+L) periods of demand) against holding cost given current large in-transit position and variable lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. On-hand=0, in-transit=462; recent concludes show mixed actual lead times: Period4 concluded arrivals indicate an order placed P1 arrived P4 (lead_time=3) and P3\u2192P4 (lead_time=1). Several subsequent orders (P2, P5, P6) remain in-transit/overdue. Given the observed variability but limited sample of concluded lead times, I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1 and 3 observations). Demand history shows no sustained regime change; use default demand/volatility estimation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (acknowledging longer/variable lead times) against holding costs while the shipment pattern stabilizes.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=506. Historical demand samples mean = (131+92+118+125+106)/5 = 114.4. Observed concluded lead times: order P1 arrived in P4 => LT=3; order P3 arrived in P4 => LT=1. Recent orders (P5-P7) have not concluded and may be delayed/lost, so actual LT is variable. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given uncertain lead time while avoiding overfitting short, noisy history. This setup lets the OR engine raise the base-stock for longer effective lead-time while capping order size per its policy.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=114, in-transit=307. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed lead_times = {3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P5->P8), 1 (P7->P8)} giving average = 2. Demand history (samples provided) has mean ~114.4; recent realized demands are similar, no clear sustained demand regime shift. Use calculated L (average observed lead time) so the OR backend accounts for the proven variability in arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given no strong recent demand change.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_10. On-hand=14, in-transit=375. Historical concluded lead times observed: orders arrived with lead_times = 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P5->P8), 1 (P7->P8) \u2014 average ~2. Demand sample mean (provided data) = 114.4. To let the OR engine account for observed lead-time variability I select L=calculate so backend uses observed average. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) given current pipeline and observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,1; average=2).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) with average \u22482; recent Periods 4\u201310 show no sustained demand regime shift (demands: 46,131,87,130,105,171,93,85,100,97). Several earlier orders were delayed but have since concluded; current pipeline (470) likely covers upcoming demand. I choose L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (no clear, sustained changepoint) so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=480. Historical concluded lead times average ~2 (observed 3,1,3,1) and match the promised lead time; no sustained demand regime change detected from available samples (historical demands: 131,92,118,125,106). I set L to default to use the promised lead time (2), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to historical averages while accounting for the 2-period review+lead window and existing pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=70, in-transit=317. Historical concluded lead times: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P5->P8=3, P7->P8=1, P9->P12=3, P10->P12=2 (avg \u22482.17). Several earlier shipments were delayed but recent concludes show a mix of 1\u20133 periods with mean \u22482. I set L=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. Demand samples (131,92,118,125,106) are limited and show no sustained regime shift, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost given the inferred lead time. This keeps service against in-transit + on-hand while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=398. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (avg\u22482.17) and multiple delayed arrivals earlier; use averaged observed lead time so backend accounts for realized variability. Set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher effective lead time) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory and prior delayed shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence includes 3,1,3,1,3,2,3) indicating actual lead time \u2260 always promised 2 and averaging >2. Use L='calculate' so backend computes the average observed lead time from concluded history. Demand history (samples Period_1-5: 131,92,118,125,106 plus later realized demands) shows no clear sustained shift in mean/variance, so use default demand formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend scale forecasts with the inferred L. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times and large in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=471. Historical concluded arrivals show varying lead_times (observed: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3) indicating actual lead time fluctuates around ~2.3. To let the backend incorporate observed lead-time variability I choose 'calculate' for L so it averages observed lead times. Demand samples (Periods 1-5: 131,92,118,125,106) show no sustained recent regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (captures extra pipeline risk via calculated L) against holding cost by relying on standard safety-stock scaling rather than inflating explicit forecasts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=392. Recent concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16). I treat lead time as 3 to protect against overdue shipments. I choose L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed longer deliveries. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this scales demand forecast and volatility for the longer review+lead period and balances service vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5 shown historically: 131,92,118,125,106; later periods show higher volatility and several large demands up to 194). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=412 (multiple prior shipments in pipeline; several 3-period arrivals recently). Observed concluded lead times vary (1,2,3) with more recent evidence of 3-period arrivals but overall average \u22482.3. I choose L=calculate so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed but trending-longer lead times). For demand scale and variability I use default formulas ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap consistently from full sample history while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances higher service level (profit>holding cost) against holding costs given large in-transit volume and uncertain arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=511. Recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 14-18 demands = 107,123,164,194,182; recent mean \u2248154). Lead-time evidence since Period 17 consistently shows 3-period arrivals (P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16); treat lead time as 3 to avoid underordering. I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. This combination prioritizes service with appropriate pipeline coverage given delayed/later arrivals and higher recent demand.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes show a persistent 3-period lead time for recent arrivals (P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) so I set L explicit=3 to reflect the longer realized lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand has risen recently (last 5 demands: 123,164,194,182,199; mean=172.4) so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the higher current level; with L=3 the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean. Volatility has also increased, so I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This increases pipeline coverage for the longer lead time while letting the OR engine trade service level vs. holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=742. Recent demand (Periods 16-20) is persistently higher (164,194,182,199,193). Several arrivals in recent history show lead_time=3 repeatedly. Choose L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid stockouts from assuming promised 2. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 16-20) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5 demands). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These settings bias orders upward to cover the longer lead time and elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders per its policy; this reduces lost sales at the expense of higher holding cost, which is warranted given the large in-transit volume and sustained demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 104.93 (Periods 1-15) to 186.40 (Periods 16-20), +77.5%.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent demand has shifted up (Periods 16-21 much higher than 1-15). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=770 (large pipeline of outstanding shipments, some previously delayed). For L I use calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for the realized variability in arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use defaults so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample history while letting L capture lead-time changes and the large pipeline inform ordering caps.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=770. Historical concludes show recent sustained higher demand since Period 16 (avg ~186) and multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 around Periods 16-17; shipments often arrive after 3 periods. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so pipeline coverage (1+L periods) matches reality. For demand I use recent_N over the post-change regime (Periods 16-22, 7 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 7 demands, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 7 demands; this focuses the forecast/uncertainty on the new higher regime and limits understocking given long lead times and large in-transit volume.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=698. Recent concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (P20->P23, P13->P16, P14->P17 etc.) with intermittent 1-2s. Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (avg ~186 after P16) so forecast should use the high-demand regime. I set L by averaging recent observed lead times to bias toward the more frequent 3-period realizations (method: recent_N, N=6). I set mu_hat using recent demand in the high-demand regime (Periods 16-23) to capture the new higher mean (method: recent_N, N=8). I set sigma_hat using the same recent window to capture current volatility (method: recent_N, N=8). These choices increase target pipeline to cover the longer observed lead times and higher demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock tradeoffs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=830. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg demand up ~+77.5%) and mixed but biased-long lead times (many observed 3-period arrivals). To capture the post-shift demand level I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 16-24, regime_length=9 => N=9). For lead time I request calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability vs promised). These choices bias orders toward the higher recent demand while letting the backend compute safety stock using the inferred average lead time, helping trade service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume and prior delayed shipments.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: recent demand elevated (post-Period16 regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=812 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-times show variability but recent arrivals (P20->P23=3, P21->P23=2, P23->P25=2) imply a short-term average lead time \u22482.33. To reflect this recent behavior and higher recent demand, set L using recent_N=3 (captures most recent lead-time pattern). Forecast demand using recent 5 periods (Periods 21-25) where demand averaged \u2248202.4; use mu_hat recent_N=5 so backend computes (1+L)*recent_mean and increases target stock to match elevated regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This combination raises base stock to preserve service during variable, elevated demand while relying on observed recent lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering despite past lost/delayed shipments.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concludes show variable lead times with multiple 3-period observations and a sustained demand increase starting Period 16 (Periods 16-26 mean \u2248186.7). To respect confirmed longer lead-times while letting backend compute a robust average, set L method to 'calculate' (use observed lead times). Demand forecast uses recent regime (Periods 16-26) so set mu_hat to recent_N with N=11 (captures elevated mean across review+lead). Volatility should reflect the same recent window, so set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=11. These choices focus stock on the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time average to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (Periods 16-27 mean \u2248181.6). Many concluded lead-time observations vary but average around 2.2. To capture confirmed longer/mixed lead-times I use calculate for L (average of observed lead times). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 12 periods (Periods 16-27) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, aligning base stock to current demand while the large in-transit position will be reconciled by the backend\u2019s pipeline subtraction.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded lead times are mixed; recent concluded lead times (P20->P23=3, P21->P23=2, P23->P25=2) average ~2.33, so I use a recent average. Demand shifted up at Period_16; recent demand (Periods 21-28) average ~166.25, so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the last 8 periods to capture the current regime while avoiding older low-demand data. These choices (L recent_N=3, mu_hat recent_N=8, sigma_hat recent_N=8) let the OR engine size base stock for the observed longer/mixed lead times and the elevated recent demand, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and hold=$1.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded lead_times show variation (values: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,1,3,2,2; avg\u22482.25). Demand peaked earlier (Period16-21) then declined; most recent 5 demands (Periods25-29)=[214,110,125,83,71], mean\u2248120.6. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to capture the recent downshift in demand and reduce overstating requirements given large in-transit stock. This balances service (use observed lead time) versus holding cost (use recent lower demand for forecast).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical conclues show variable lead times (1,2,3) with several 3-period arrivals and recent 2-period arrivals. Because actual lead time has fluctuated, I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so L reflects realized behavior. Demand samples show a sustained higher regime earlier but recent volatility; I use default demand/volatility formulas ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with the chosen L and full sample history. This balances service (capture observed longer lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) with sustained higher demand from Period_16 onward (+77.5% per prior insight). Many past orders remain in-transit but concluded arrivals through Period_25 show lead times still variable. I set L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times (captures variability). For demand, a sustained regime shift began at Period_16; I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (Periods 16\u201331) to base forecast and volatility on the high-demand regime, and (1+L) scaling will be applied by backend. This balances service (higher mean to meet elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=812 (large pipeline from prior orders). Recent concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133) with average \u22482.25; many late arrivals earlier indicate unreliable shipments. Demand history shows earlier regime shift (higher demand from Period_16\u201320) but more recent periods (26\u201332) are moderate; no clear new sustained demand regime. To handle uncertain/variable lead time I let the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded messages (calculate). For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this leverages full sample set and the larger pipeline to avoid aggressive ordering given 812 in-transit. This balances service (captures observed longer average lead time) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded lead times show mix (1,2,3) with several 3-period observations; no new sustained lead-time change since Period_17. Demand spiked around Periods 16-20 but has returned lower in Periods 24-33. I choose L=calculate to let backend use average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=10, last 10 periods) to capture the post-spike lower-demand regime (Periods 24-33) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand over the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These settings avoid overstocking from the earlier spike while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large existing pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals and prior confirmed 3-period lead time (Periods 9-16), so let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). Recent realized demand has declined vs. the Period-16..20 spike; to avoid overstocking given large in-transit pipeline, forecast demand using the most recent short-run data: use recent_N with N=5 (latest 5 periods) for mu_hat. Use default sigma_hat (backend sqrt(1+L)*std of samples) to let OR engine apply observed volatility. This balances service level (accounting for observed lead-time behavior) against holding cost given the large pipeline of 812 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_36 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries; average observed lead time \u22482.23 (from concluded samples). Demand had a sustained regime shift at Period_16 (higher mean through Period_20) but overall mean since Period_1 is ~127.7; recent variability exists but no new sustained shift since prior notes. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the calculated average observed lead time so the OR engine accounts for longer/variable arrivals; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) to avoid overreacting to short recent swings while leveraging all available demand history. This also leverages the large in-transit pipeline when backend computes orders.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_37. On-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., Period_17 confirmations and several P->P+3 arrivals); recent evidence favors actual lead time = 3 rather than promised 2. I set L explicit=3 to force the OR backend to plan over the longer realized pipeline. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided historical samples (robust given limited sample set). This balances service level (longer L increases mu_hat) against holding cost; large in-transit volume already reduces immediate ordering needs via the OR cap.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=812 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show multiple orders arriving with 3-period delays (Periods 1->4,5->8,9->12,13->16,14->17,20->23) indicating actual lead time = 3 is persistent. Demand since Period 24 has been moderate (~100-170) but lower and more variable than the earlier spike; to reflect recent realized lead time and recent demand, I set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to size orders for a 3-period lead. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=14 (covering Periods 24-37) to capture the current post-spike regime average over the most recent periods. sigma_hat uses default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the backend compute volatility scaled to the chosen lead time. This combination raises pipeline coverage for the observed longer lead time while using recent demand to avoid overstocking from the older high-demand spike.

Recent demand (Periods_34-38 = 96,135,112,100,130) is lower than the earlier spike. To avoid under-ordering given observed actual LT=3 and large but delayed pipeline, set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the most recent stable window (last 5 periods) to reflect the current lower-demand regime: use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders for (1+L) review+lead using current demand level. This keeps service high without exacerbating holding costs given the large in-transit stock.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_40. On-hand=0, in-transit=812 (large pipeline, many overdue deliveries historically). Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed 3s at Periods 4,16-17,23) and intermittent 2s; to be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 to cover observed delivery delays and reduce stockouts. For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this uses full history including the sustained demand jump around Period_16 while keeping estimates stable given recent variability. These choices bias orders upward to prioritize service (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) while acknowledging large pipeline to avoid over-ordering lost shipments.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample average ~2.25 periods) with several 3-period arrivals confirmed earlier; demand regime shift at Period 16 (+77.5%) remains the last sustained change. To account for observed longer-than-promised deliveries, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times. Demand and volatility: no new sustained demand regime change since the documented Period 16 shift, so use default estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend balances service level from confirmed higher demand while limiting extra safety stock beyond that implied by observed lead times and historical variability.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and earlier sustained demand uplift around Period_16\u201320 but recent demands have moderated. Many earlier delayed shipments resolved; with substantial pipeline (812) I rely on observed lead-time history rather than promised value and let backend compute demand scale from full sample set. Chosen methods: L=calculate to reflect average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses all samples (scaled by 1+L) to produce base-stock and cap. This balances service (uses realized lead time) while avoiding overreacting to short-term demand noise given large in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (many 3-period observations) so use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Demand shifted up at Period_16 and that higher-regime persists; base-stock demand forecast should use recent data from the post-shift regime. Therefore: L set to calculate (average of observed lead times). mu_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent high-demand regime (capped at 20). sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward provisioning for the sustained higher demand while using inferred lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given in-transit backlog and delayed arrivals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. History shows heterogeneous actual lead times (observed samples avg\u22482.25) and many delayed/missing arrivals earlier, so use backend's calculated average lead time to capture observed variability. Set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples (leveraging full history) which balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Recent history shows highly variable but elevated demand since Period 16 (previously recorded +77.5% regime shift) and intermittent long lead-times (observed 1\u20133). Many past shipments arrived late or with L=3 frequently. Given inconsistent realized lead times and multiple concluded lead-time observations, use the data-driven average lead time so the OR engine internal pipeline matches observed reality. Use default demand and volatility aggregation across all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend leverages full historical demand to set base stock; this balances service vs. holding given large in-transit stock. These choices guard against under-ordering if actual lead time > promised and let the OR engine cap orders appropriately using its cap formulation.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concludes show variable lead times including multiple 3-period arrivals; given mixed evidence but persistent variability I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Demand samples (Periods 1-5 shown in environment snapshot plus full history) do not show a new sustained regime since the earlier Period_16-20 spike was short-lived, so I use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. Large in-transit volume will be accounted for by the pipeline term in ordering; these choices balance service level (by reflecting true average lead time) against holding cost via the OR engine's capped order.

Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=812 units (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) and some lost/delayed arrivals; use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times from concluded history. Demand has a confirmed regime shift earlier; however the large in-transit pipeline and variable lead times argue for using default demand estimates across all samples so the OR engine's base-stock balances service vs holding cost while the backend's cap limits order size. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained lead_time=3 (evidence from Periods 9->12,11->14,13->16 and carry-over confirmation at Period_17). Demand increased starting Period_16; to capture the post-shift regime I set lead time explicit=3 and use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (uses most recent 20 concluded demand samples to reflect the higher-demand regime). This balances service (longer confirmed LT -> larger (1+L) horizon) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent high-demand regime and letting the OR cap limit extreme orders given pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) with confirmed 3-period episodes earlier but mixed outcomes since; many orders remain in-transit so I do not assume a new permanent lead-time shift. Demand history (Periods 1\u201348) shows higher mean after Period 16 but that regime shift is already recorded. To let the OR engine infer average lead time from observed concludes while using its default demand aggregation, I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times, and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (uses observed lead-time avg) against holding cost without introducing risky manual overrides given many outstanding in-transit units and no new sustained signals.

LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), recent observations average ~2.3; demand spiked around Period_16 but subsequent periods reverted to lower, variable demand. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).
