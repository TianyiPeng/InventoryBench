What we observe now: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, and there are no concluded arrivals yet (no evidence to contradict promised lead time or signal lost shipments). Lead-time inference: cannot confirm any lead-time deviation because no 'Period X conclude' messages exist yet. Risk assessment: with zero on-hand/pipeline, ordering only OR's 141 would underfill expected demand over the next 3 periods (141 \u226a 343), risking stockouts and lost sales. Inventory cost tradeoff: profit = $1 and holding = $1, so critical fractile 0.5 implies no added safety stock is optimal under symmetric cost, but we must at least cover expected demand over L+1 to satisfy the constraint to cover (L+1) periods. Decision: place an order equal to expected demand over L+1 (rounded) = 343 units to ensure coverage for the current period plus the L future periods. This overrides OR's capped recommendation because OR's cap prevents covering the full (L+1)-period expected demand when pipeline is empty.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 449 units (these are outstanding and will arrive across upcoming periods per past patterns). Decision horizon: with confirmed L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand after our decision. Demand assessment: historical early-sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) ~114.4 and OR uses similar averaging; recent periods show volatility including multi-period spikes (Periods 16\u201318), but spikes are not yet a sustained regime shift lasting 3+ periods. Cost tradeoff: profit = holding cost so critical fractile q=0.5 (no tilt toward overstocking); ordering now exposes us to holding cost for units that may arrive after demand subsides. OR recommended 0 units, which already accounts for capped base-stock using promised L. Given large in-transit (449) and confirmed L=3, placing additional order that arrives after 3 periods risks excess holding cost unless we have strong evidence of a sustained upward demand regime. No new sustained demand shift or lead-time change (need 3+ periods of consistent evidence) is present.
