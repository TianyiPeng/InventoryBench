Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates from all provided samples (Periods 1-5) because there is no evidence of a regime change. Profit/holding implies high service target, so default base-stock ((1+L)*mean) and volatility estimates are appropriate to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=140 (ordered P1, arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude) \u2014 no evidence lead time differs from promised 2 periods yet. Use promised lead time to let OR backend account for 2-period pipeline. Demand history (Period_1-5 samples) shows mean ~95.6; no sustained regime change detected. Choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled std, keeping service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreaction to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Observed demand history shows samples [82,89,65,106,136]; on-hand=0, in-transit=275 (sum of Period1/2 orders 140+135). No concluded arrivals yet (both prior orders still in-transit), so actual lead time is not confirmed \u2014 follow promised lead time. Use default methods so OR backend computes base_stock from promised L and full-sample mean/std. This balances service level (using full-sample demand) while avoiding speculative adjustments for unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Historical demand samples: [82,89,65,106,136] (mean=95.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (orders from P1-P3: 140+135+60). Promised lead time=2 but none of those orders have concluded as arrived by their promised arrival windows, so shipments are overdue. I choose default lead time (use promised L=2) because there are no concluded arrivals to confirm an actual lead time; using default keeps OR engine assumptions aligned with promised lead time while the system investigates missing arrivals. For demand I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that covers review+lead demand given current uncertainty. This approach maintains service focus while avoiding overreacting to potentially lost shipments until arrival evidence is observed.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 totaling 335 units have not arrived by their promised lead-time windows (no arrivals concluded for P1,P2,P3 orders); suggests lost shipments or actual lead time >2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5 = 82,89,65,106,136) show mean demand ~95.6. On-hand=92, in-transit=149, but one outstanding large order (Period_2:135) still not concluded\u2014evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Period_4 conclude shows mixed lead times (P1\u21923, P3\u21921), so use averaged observed lead time (calculate) so backend adapts L from actual observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for the inferred lead time while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by letting the OR engine set safety stock via its q formula while reflecting observed lead-time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=294. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (Period1 order arrived after 3 periods; Period3 order after 1 period) so observed average lead time \u22482. Several earlier orders missed their promised windows (P2 still unarrived) but evidence is not yet a sustained lead-time shift. Use calculated L to reflect observed average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 7. On-hand=0, in-transit=441. Historical concludes show heterogeneous lead times (Period1 order arrived in P4 => LT=3; Period3 order arrived in P4 => LT=1) and several delayed/missing arrivals earlier. I set L to "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability and yields ~2). For demand I pick "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead times and the large in-transit position. This approach is conservative: it lets the OR engine adjust target base-stock using the empirically averaged lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats rather than short recent windows (no sustained, clear demand regime shift detected).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=449; recent concluded arrivals show mixed but slower deliveries (observed lead_times = 3,1,3) and earlier missing shipments. Given evidence of longer-than-promised transit on multiple orders, I choose to let the backend infer an empirical lead time average from observed concludes to reflect actual delivery behavior. Use default demand aggregation (mu_hat default and sigma_hat default) so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, maintaining responsiveness to the full historical demand (Periods 1\u20135 samples). This balances higher safety stock from longer inferred L against holding cost while relying on the OR engine's capped ordering to limit excessive orders during uncertain arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: demand history shows recent higher demand (samples: 82,89,65,106,136) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead times around 3 periods (several 3s and occasional 1s). Current inventory: on-hand=33, in-transit=296 (total pipeline=329). Using recent_N for L (N=3) captures the latest lead-time regime (avg of last 3 observed lead times \u22482.33) so the OR engine will size reorder points for the longer effective lead time. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to produce a stable forecast and volatility estimate; given pipeline (~329) this keeps service while avoiding excessive extra holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demands average 95.6/unit (samples P1\u2013P5). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=425 \u2014 enough to cover multi-period demand. Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} (avg=2.0), so use calculated average lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; with L anchored to observed average this balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline and recent demand stats. No new sustained changepoint beyond prior missing-shipment insight.

Demand history shows recent variability but no clear sustained regime shift; I use a recent demand window to capture latest demand level. Choices: L=set to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect actual behavior (method=calculate). mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current demand without over-weighting older data). sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (using observed lead time and recent demand) against holding cost given high in-transit volume and on-hand=0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=95, in-transit=282. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed W in concluded arrivals: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2) indicating mean lead_time slightly above promised 2. Use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history is limited to provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service (capturing observed longer lead-time) vs holding cost by increasing order coverage only to the degree supported by concluded lead-time evidence. Current pipeline+on-hand (377) appears sufficient for a modest increase in L.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.125). On-hand=11, in-transit=318 (large pipeline but earlier periods showed delayed/lost arrivals). Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given uncertain lead time while avoiding overfitting to short windows amid noisy arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) with several 3-period delays; recent pipeline includes overdue/later arrivals so continue treating lead time as higher than promised. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflecting mixed 1\u20133 period arrivals). For demand, historical sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) is the primary signal; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain/lengthened lead times and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Observed average lead time = 2.125 periods across 8 concluded arrivals; 3-period delays observed in 4 of 8 arrivals (sustained intermittent 3-period lead time).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

To capture actual lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times. For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend incorporates the full sample history while the calculated L syncs pipeline coverage to observed delays\u2014this balances service level uplift (cover longer lead times) against holding cost given the visible in-transit stock.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=8, in-transit=371. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent long delays and some lost shipments early; recent arrivals confirm frequent 3-period lead times. Observed lead times (concluded): [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3] (n=9, avg=2.33). Many in-transit units likely still en route with effective lead time > promised 2. To account for the empirically longer lead time, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine sizes orders for the true pipeline length. For demand I use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because no clear sustained demand regime change is present in the five provided samples (mean demand=95.6). Volatility is left to default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices increase planned pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals while the OR backend will cap orders per its cap rule to limit over-ordering and holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as intermittently 3 periods: observed lead times across 9 concluded arrivals avg=2.33, with 3-period delays in 6 of 9 arrivals (evidence of sustained intermittent 3-period lead time).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent history shows intermittent extended lead times with many 3-period arrivals. Observed concluded lead times (10 arrivals): [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3], avg=2.3. Demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean=95.6. On-hand=43, in-transit=312 (pipeline large). I set L via calculate to let the backend use the empirically observed average lead time (captures intermittent 3-period delays). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative aggregate forecast while the pipeline is already large and holding costs are moderate.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=3, in-transit=349. Historical concluded lead times (10 arrivals) average 2.3 with frequent 3-periods -> actual lead time intermittently 3. Use L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time (captures the 2.3 avg). Demand history mean from samples will be scaled by (1+L) by backend, so use default mu_hat to apply that. Variability will be handled by backend's default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (accounting for longer intermittent lead-times) versus holding cost given large current in-transit stock; defaults avoid over-adjusting forecast from short recent demand variations.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple 3s in recent history). I set L to recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent shift toward longer, intermittent lead times (avg of last 8 observed lead times \u22482.375). Demand has been moderate recently (Periods 15-19 demands = 84,28,43,40,57); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, making the base-stock responsive to the latest demand regime while accounting for longer/variable lead times. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit but delayed shipments) against holding cost by relying on recent demand and a lead-time estimate that reflects observed 3-period occurrences.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=384; recent concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (majority of recent observations are 3). Demand historical mean=95.6 (5 samples). I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time regime (N=6) because arrivals have shifted toward 3-period delays; mu_hat set explicit to cover (1+L)\xd7mean demand \u2248329.4 units to ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand given longer effective lead time; sigma_hat set explicit=45.0 to reflect elevated demand variability scaled for multi-period demand. These choices hedge against overdue/lost shipments by increasing target base-stock and volatility allowance so the OR backend orders sufficient safety stock despite intermittent 3-period delays.

I select L="calculate" so backend uses the observed average lead time (captures intermittent 3-period behavior). Demand samples mean=95.6; to cover review+lead demand without overfitting recent noise I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples.

Current period: 24. Recent concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) so I treat actual lead time as 3. Recent demand has dropped vs. early samples (last 8 concluded demands avg \u224841.1), so I base forecast on the most recent 8 periods to capture the lower regime. On-hand=0 + in-transit=384 vs. (1+L)=4 periods forecast will be checked by backend; using recent demand reduces overstock risk while explicit L=3 protects service given observed delays.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this balances service level given elevated effective lead time while avoiding overfitting recent noisy periods. No explicit adjustments despite large pipeline because arrivals may be delayed or lost; backend cap will limit excessive orders.

On-hand=0, in-transit=384 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers several periods given longer lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed intermittent 3-period delays and avoid under-ordering. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent lower-demand regime, so the OR backend orders to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while limiting holding cost exposure given sizable pipeline.

Period_27. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (sustained evidence through Period_17), so I estimate lead time from recent observed arrivals. I set L using recent_N to capture the recent realized lead-time mix (N=9). Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use default to leverage full sample history; with large in-transit inventory (384) the backend will cap orders appropriately while default \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 provide stable service-level sizing against holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: recent demand samples average = mean(82,89,65,106,136)=? but historical pattern shows volatile demand with several 3-period arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=384 (sizable pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (see history); I'll ask backend to use calculate for L so it averages observed lead times (captures intermittent 3s). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2014 this balances service vs holding given profit=4, holding=1 and large pipeline. This avoids overfitting short recent zeros while letting L reflect realized lead-time mix.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: recent history shows intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with 3-period delays) and large in-transit volume (384) while on-hand=0. Use lead-time estimate derived from observed arrivals (calculate) so backend sees average actual L>promised; demand samples (Periods 1-5) still represent baseline. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given inferred L. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by increasing the replenishment target through a larger effective review+lead period demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 30, on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (many recent arrivals with LT=3; recent avg LT \u22482.33). To account for realized longer-than-promised lead times, set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. Use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to keep forecasts grounded in full history while the calculated L raises coverage for extra pipeline risk. This balances higher service level (capture intermittent 3-period delays) against holding cost by not inflating demand estimate beyond historical mean.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (avg >2) and multiple lost/delayed shipments earlier; pipeline is large now so we must still respect longer effective lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed concluded lead times (captures intermittent 3-period behavior). Demand recently has been elevated and variable (Periods 26-30 demands = 77,75,47,75,92) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime. This gives the OR engine a lead-time estimate informed by actual arrivals while sizing base-stock and cap using the most recent demand mean and std to balance service (profit $4 vs hold $1) and limit excess holding given large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Demand history is limited and shows no new sustained regime shift since prior insights, so use default demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend balances service level vs holding cost using its standard stats.

Demand recent history (Periods 28-32) remains ~47,75,92,55,79. To protect service given frequent 3-period delays, set lead time estimate using recent lead-time observations. For demand forecast and volatility use the most recent 5 demand periods to capture current regime. These choices increase pipeline cover for possible 3-period arrival delays while keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to recent demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show many 3-period arrivals (observed lead times list yields avg \u2248 2.3), indicating intermittent lengthening vs promised L=2. I set L="calculate" so backend uses observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (~2.3). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults (mu_hat="default", sigma_hat="default") so (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are applied consistently with the inferred lead time; this balances higher safety stock needed for longer effective lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats given no sustained recent demand regime shift.

I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed concluded lead times (captures intermittent 3-period behavior). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine scale safety stock to the inferred lead time and balance profit vs. holding cost. This approach addresses missing/delayed shipments by explicitly inferring actual lead time from concluded arrivals rather than trusting the promised lead time.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales demand across (1+L) using all samples (conservative pooling given limited recent shipped data) balancing service level vs holding cost while leveraging inferred longer lead time.

Demand recently stabilized in the high 70s\u201380s (Periods 35\u201339: 84,83,82,77,77) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime and avoid overreacting to older volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean ~95 and current trailing demands (Periods 6\u201340) are consistently 33\u2013116, indicating stable regular demand without clear seasonal spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=384 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past shipments experienced intermittent 3-period delays. Use lead-time inference from concluded arrivals (calculate) to capture the observed intermittent 3-period pattern rather than trusting the promised L=2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the inferred L; this balances service (by expanding lead-time coverage when actual L>2) against holding cost given existing large pipeline. This choice guards against under-ordering if lead time is longer while the backend cap limits excessive orders.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (observed lead_times from concluded arrivals = [3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3], avg\u22482.44 across 9 observations), indicating actual lead time > promised 2 with frequent 3-period delays. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the observed-average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand scaling automatically incorporates the chosen L and full sample history. This balances higher pipeline needs (to cover longer effective lead time) against holding cost by letting OR compute safety stock from profit/holding ratio.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple 3s among concluded arrivals), and earlier missing shipments but recent arrivals confirm actual lead time >2 at times. To let the backend infer average realized lead time from concluded arrivals, I set L='calculate'. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this balances service level vs holding cost while letting OR engine apply base-stock formula using observed lead-time estimate and full sample history. No new sustained regime change detected.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (sustained pattern noted through Period 17). To let the OR engine internal stats incorporate observed lead-time behavior, set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, keeping forecast broad-based given limited recent regime evidence. This balances service (captures longer average lead-time) vs holding cost by letting OR compute safety stock from full-sample volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple 3s since Period_4), so set lead time to the average of observed lead times to capture this shift. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes mu_hat/sigma_hat consistent with the inferred L and full sample history. This balances higher safety stock for longer effective lead time while letting backend cap orders.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. History shows frequent intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with LT=3); carry-over already documents this. To let the OR engine infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals, I set L using 'calculate'. Demand history samples (Periods 1-5 provided) and full-sample statistics remain the best available forecast anchors, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (using observed average lead time) against holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock via profit/(profit+holding) and the capped order cap.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show 10 observed lead times: [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3], average = 2.3 with frequent 3-period delays (intermittent). To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, set L by calculation (avg observed). Demand samples seed remain the original sample set, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances raising target inventory for slightly longer effective lead time while relying on historical demand stats to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (sampled lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3 \u2192 avg\u22482.3). Given sustained intermittent 3-period delays, use calculated average lead time so the OR engine accounts for longer effective L. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean = (82+89+65+106+136)/5 = 95.6; using default mu/sigma scales with (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively so backend will inflate review+lead demand and variability proportional to inferred L. This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals) against holding cost with conservative pipeline coverage.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with intermittent 3-period lead times (evidence in prior carry-overs); several earlier orders missed promised windows causing large in-transit backlog. I set L to recent_N (N=9) to capture the most recent observed lead-time behavior (intermittent 3-periods) rather than trusting the promised 2. For demand I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from all available demand samples scaled by (1+L); this keeps the OR backend aligned with long-run demand while the adjusted L accounts for delayed arrivals and reduces the risk of stockouts given the observed intermittent 3-period delays. No new sustained regime change detected to record.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50. On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show intermittent 3-period lead times (multiple 3s among recent concluded arrivals through Period_17). Demand history (Periods 1\u201349) shows a stable moderate demand regime in recent periods (many periods with demand ~70\u201390, occasional spikes). To account for observed intermittent longer lead times I set L using a recent-average of observed lead times (captures recent 3-period occurrences). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 20 demand observations to reflect the current regime and avoid bias from very early periods; same 20-sample window for sigma to capture recent volatility. These parameters balance service (covering L+1 periods of demand given intermittent 3-period delays) versus holding cost by relying on recent demand statistics rather than full-history extremes.
