  Mean: 95.6, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with no on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and historical samples to let OR backend compute base-stock and caps: set L to default (promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend calculates (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (no recent changepoint evidence and only 5 historical points). This balances service level versus holding cost given lack of new signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: recent observed demand history shows samples [82,89,65,106,136] with on-hand=0 and in-transit=140 (order from P1 not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals and no confirmed lead-time shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (sum of prior orders 140+139). No concluded arrivals yet (Period1 and Period2 orders still in-transit), so there is no confirmed lead-time change. Demand history samples: [82,89,65,106,136], mean=95.6. I will keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded messages provide no evidence to change it. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while we await arrival confirmations.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=395. Historical concluded messages show orders placed in Periods 1-3 but arrived=0; promised lead time is 2 but no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time cannot be confirmed from conclude messages. Because we lack evidence to change inferred lead time or demand regime, use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost while we await concluded arrival information; existing large in-transit quantity reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not conclude by their promised lead time (promised L=2) \u2014 3 consecutive periods of missing arrivals; in-transit reported=395 units; possible lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Profit: $1596.00, Daily Holding Cost: $172.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1424.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent history shows rising demand (samples: 82,89,65,106,136) with a clear uptick in the last 3 periods (65,106,136 => mean\u2248102). Concluded arrivals in Period_4 show mixed lead times (order P1 arrived with lead_time=3; order P3 arrived with lead_time=1) so actual lead time is uncertain. On-hand=172 + in-transit=156 = 328 units in pipeline; I use a calculated lead-time estimate based on observed lead times and focus demand forecast on the most recent regime (last 3 periods) to capture the upward shift while keeping volatility estimated from the same window. These choices help the OR backend set base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under elevated recent demand while avoiding overstating variance from older samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $928.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: on-hand=117, in-transit=336. Demand history samples mean=95.6 (periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (order P1\u2192arrived P4, W=3; order P3\u2192arrived P4, W=1) and recent missing arrival (P5 ordered arrived=0), so lead time is uncertain and variable. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability without overcommitting). For demand I choose default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to anchor to long-run sample mean while accounting for lead/review period. For volatility I choose default sigma_hat to use all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost, and remain conservative given possible delayed/lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1763.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: recent demand samples (P1-5) show mean ~95.6 with volatility; on-hand=23, in-transit=392 and several orders have failed to conclude on promised L=2 (multiple periods with arrived=0), indicating delayed/lost shipments risk. Observed concluded lead times: 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4) so average actual \u22482. To be conservative but data-driven I set L by calculate (average observed lead times). Demand forecast uses default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to give the OR engine the long-run demand anchor; sigma_hat uses default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled for review+lead period. These settings keep the backend base-stock tied to historical demand while L=calculate captures the observed lead-time variability and guards against under-ordering given overdue shipments.

Daily Profit: $760.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $760.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. Recent demand (Periods 3-7): 142,84,55,94,114 \u2014 volatile but average trending ~98 over last 5. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (multiple past delays: several orders arrived late or not by promised L=2). Observed concluded lead times: 3,1,3 -> I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime (captures recent spike/decline pattern). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while respecting evidence of delayed shipments.

Daily Profit: $950.00, Daily Holding Cost: $216.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $734.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: recent concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals (orders placed P1 arrived P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and intermittent 1-period arrivals, indicating actual lead time > promised. Current on-hand=216, in-transit=233; pipeline + on-hand =449 units which should cover several periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine uses empirical lead-time average. For demand, I use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and default volatility so the backend applies the base-stock formula using all historical demand (Periods 1\u20135). This balances service level against holding cost given confirmed longer lead times and available pipeline; defaults avoid overfitting to short recent spikes while reflecting longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 4; Period 4->Period 7 arrival; Period 5->Period 8 arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2006.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=141, in-transit=240, recent demand has averaged moderately (~55-114). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time \u22483. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering from underestimated lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (Periods 5-9) where demand averaged ~85.2; mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7recent mean to cover review+lead demand. Volatility is computed from the same recent 5 samples (recent_N) so sigma_hat reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given longer lead time) while limiting excess holding by using recent demand rather than all-time mean.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=70, in-transit=302. Historical concl: multiple arrivals show actual lead time \u22483 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Pipeline looks healthy (302 units) but with confirmed longer lead time vs promised, so use L=3 to size review+lead coverage. Demand history mean=95.6 (samples: 82,89,65,106,136). I choose L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality (avoids under-ordering when shipments take longer). For demand forecast and uncertainty I use default formulas so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean across all samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level (profit high) against holding cost conservatively given substantial pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent demand volatile but trending near ~90\u2013110 units. Observed concluded lead times show mixed 1s and 3s; average of observed lead times is best estimate this period. Use recent demand (last 5 periods, P7\u2013P11) to capture post-arrival regime (demands: 114,50,113,71,107) for the review+lead forecast and matching recent volatility for sigma.

LLM Rationale:

Historical conclues show frequent 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) despite promised L=2; actual lead time appears sustained at 3. To protect service while acknowledging higher lead time and avoid stockouts given zero on-hand, set L explicit=3. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level vs holding cost under the longer lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent concluded history shows multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) so actual lead time is best treated as 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=467 (large pipeline) \u2014 some of these are expected to arrive with L=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. For demand forecasting I use default aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the optimizer balance profit vs. holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and the available pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. Current on-hand=51, in-transit=388; profit=19, holding=1. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead time=3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Pipeline is large so treat lead time as 3 to match observed arrivals and avoid underordering. Demand has trended higher recently; I use recent_N=5 (Periods 10-14 demands = [71,107,110,149,64]) to capture the current regime for forecast mean and volatility. These choices raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while the large pipeline mitigates stockout risk; using recent samples reduces sensitivity to older lower-demand periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time ~3 periods (multiple orders showed 3-period arrivals). Pipeline (451) likely covers several periods but arrivals are observed with 1-period observation delay. Demand history (samples provided) has mean ~95.6. Given confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts over a 4-period exposure. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this yields a higher base-stock to prioritize service (profit >> holding cost) while relying on observed demand stats and the confirmed longer lead time to avoid stockouts. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments now because recent arrivals support L=3; in-transit will be consumed by the OR cap if necessary.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 snapshot: on-hand=122, in-transit=349. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals and some 1-2 period arrivals; evidence supports using observed average lead time rather than promised L=2. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent persistent 3-period behavior). Demand history (provided samples) is limited, so I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent realized arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, etc.). On-hand=145, in-transit=270; demand in most recent 5 periods = [149,64,97,23,56], mean \u224877.8 with high variability. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so pipeline coverage targets (1+L) periods. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower/more volatile regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) captures recent variability. These choices reduce stockouts from underestimated lead time while avoiding excessive long-term holding by using recent demand stats.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=129, in-transit=324. History shows many arrivals with lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals) but also some 1s and a 2; average observed lead time \u22482.31. There are no new sustained demand regime shifts in recent samples (recent demands: 82,89,65,106,136). To let the OR backend incorporate actual lead-time behavior while using all observed evidence, I request the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I'll use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the base-stock will reflect the full-sample demand statistics adjusted for the inferred lead time. This balances service level (capturing longer observed lead times) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=100, in-transit=324. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with a bias > promised 2 (observed lead times sample mean \u22482.25). Recent sequence has more 3-period arrivals. I set L via recent_N (N=6) to weight recent evidence of longer/more volatile lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses all demand samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) letting L adjustment scale the forecast and uncertainty; this balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by increasing coverage for longer lead-time risk while not overstating demand shifts. Current pipeline (324) plus on-hand (100) appears ample versus typical demand samples, but elevated L protects against delayed arrivals.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=39, in-transit=341; recent history shows arrivals consistently 3 periods after order (confirmed actual lead time=3). Given confirmed L=3, set L explicit=3 so backend accounts for longer pipeline. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (conservative pooling across history). This increases base-stock to cover the extra lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1).

Given confirmed LT shift to 3, set L via calculate so backend uses observed lead-times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand history, providing a conservative base-stock covering the longer review+lead horizon while balancing holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

Many arrivals are delayed beyond the promised L=2, so use observed lead times. I set L='calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed L\u22483). For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this scales forecasts and safety stock up automatically for the longer confirmed lead time and balances service vs holding cost given high profit and low holding cost. This reconciles the large in-transit volume and aims to avoid stockouts while limiting excess inventory buildup.

LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, etc.), so I bias lead-time estimate toward recent observed lead times. I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default to reflect overall sample volatility; this balances service level (higher base stock when L>promised) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3 across Periods 4,7,8,12,14-16,23). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed real lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the backend produces a base-stock that balances the high service requirement implied by profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Current pipeline (~416) already covers ~4 periods \xd7 historical mean demand, so this avoids over-ordering while ensuring service under the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=432. History shows variable actual lead times (observed W values include many 3s and some 2s/1s); recent arrivals show 2s appearing but 3 remains common. To capture the most recent lead-time mix while smoothing older 3s, I use recent_N for L with N=5 (average of last 5 observed lead times). Demand forecast and volatility will use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the chosen L. This approach responds to mixed but persistent elevated lead times while avoiding overfitting short blips.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. On-hand=0, in-transit=432. History shows frequent 3-period arrivals and some shorter ones; average observed lead time > promised (\u22482.31). To capture true lead-time behavior let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the OR engine size base-stock given the inferred L and full-sample statistics.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29. On-hand=0, in-transit=407. Historical concluded lead times average \u22482.25 (multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals but some 1\u20132s); I therefore let the backend compute average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) given pipeline coverage.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period lead time observations (periods noted in history), suggesting actual lead time > promised. Demand samples (82,89,65,106,136) show no sustained regime shift\u2014mean ~95.6. Given confirmed longer lead times, let backend compute average observed L from concluded history (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this keeps safety stock aligned with observed variability while respecting the OR engine's cap and balancing high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12 etc.), so actual lead time differs from promised. Use calculate for L to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this leverages full demand history while the calculated L accounts for the longer realized transit times and helps the OR engine size orders to cover the extra review+lead period without manual explicit forecasting.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (evidence: multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12). To ensure orders cover the review+lead horizon and account for observed delays I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this provides a robust baseline demand forecast while the explicit L increases safety against delayed arrivals, balancing service level uplift vs holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical conclude messages show many realized lead times (observed W values: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,3,2,2,2) \u2192 avg=2.25. Large in-transit and past multi-period delays indicate actual lead time > promised; set L to the calculated average to reflect this. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full-sample demand statistics while accounting for the longer inferred lead time.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_34. On-hand=0, In-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mixed 1\u20133 periods) with average observed lead time \u22482.22; no new sustained changepoint since prior confirmation of L=3 at Period_9. To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time variability, I request L be estimated from observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend leverages full history and its promised-lead-time model; this balances service level given high in-transit volume while avoiding aggressive extra ordering given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=420.

Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend will compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), balancing service vs holding cost given the inferred L and full demand history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,7,8,12,14,16,23,33) consistently show orders arriving after 3 periods; lead time has been confirmed as 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering against in-transit delays. I use mu_hat default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) (captures demand across review+lead with L=3) and sigma_hat default so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices ensure the OR engine raises base-stock to cover the longer observed pipeline and balances higher service level (profit $19 vs hold $1) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=433. Historical concluded lead times show many 3-period occurrences but some 1-2 period arrivals; average of observed lead times \u22482.22. Demand history is volatile but no clear sustained recent regime change. To account for the observed longer-than-promised lead times, set L using the calculated average of observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (conservative given no confirmed demand regime shift). This balances higher pipeline uncertainty (longer L) with the backend's CAP on orders to avoid excessive inventory holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

History shows multiple lead-time observations (mix of 1\u20133 periods) with recent pattern leaning >2 and past confirmed episodes of 3-period arrivals; several shipments were delayed historically but no new sustained shift in demand observed. I choose L=calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures realized delays). Demand uncertainty and no clear recent demand regime change -> use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (accounting for longer realized lead times) against holding cost given high in-transit stock and zero on-hand.

Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 substantial pipeline but past history shows variable/extended lead times (many observed W=1\u20133, average \u22482.16). Use lead-time inference from concluded history so backend knows true average. Set L=calculate so backend computes average observed lead time (~2.16). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and profit/holding tradeoff.

Many periods with no same-period arrivals earlier indicate unreliable same-period arrivals; use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. I select mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand history\u2014this leverages full-sample demand estimates while the explicit L=3 protects against understating pipeline needs given delayed shipments, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent arrivals with W=3); several past periods showed delayed/lost shipments but recent history confirms L=3. To ensure pipeline covers the longer realized lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a robust baseline forecast while the explicit L guards against under-ordering due to delayed arrivals and balances service level vs. holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence in history; orders placed P1->arrived P4 etc.). Given confirmed LT=3, I set L explicit=3 so the OR engine forecasts across the correct (1+L) review+lead horizon. Demand/volatility will use default aggregation (all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively\u2014this leverages full-sample stability given no strong recent sustained demand regime shift. This choice balances service (higher base stock because of longer LT) versus holding cost; existing large in-transit (426) will be reconciled by the backend's pipeline adjustment. No new lost-shipment pattern detected this period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_43. On-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period lead-time observations (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12); use calculated lead time to reflect this shift. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures persistent increase to ~3). For demand forecast and safety, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full history while the lead-time change is handled by L. This balances service level (longer pipeline due to L) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period actual lead times (confirmed in earlier periods), and multiple delayed arrivals/lost shipment episodes. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures confirmed 3-period behavior). Demand parameters use mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all) respectively \u2014 conservative aggregate forecast given limited recent on-hand and large pipeline. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) versus holding cost with no explicit recent-regime override.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages (multiple periods) confirm actual lead time \u2248 3 (orders repeatedly arriving 3 periods after order). Promised L=2 is unreliable; set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delivery delay so the OR backend sizes pipeline for the longer exposure. Use default demand/volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples, preserving the full-sample forecast while accounting for longer lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time and large in-transit) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the safety stock using profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=420, recent history shows multiple arrivals with observed lead times varying (1\u20133) and earlier confirmed episodes of 3-period lead time and delayed/lost shipments. Given mixed evidence but persistent variability, choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (Periods 1\u20135 sample set provided across game) will be used by backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat: use default (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std to produce base-stock and caps. This conservative approach leverages empirical lead-time estimate while letting OR engine compute forecast scaling; it avoids overcommitting inventory despite high profit-to-holding ratio and acknowledges in-transit units that may still arrive or be lost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders with 3-period arrivals). To cover the longer pipeline and avoid stockouts I set L explicitly to 3. With L=3 I use default demand summarization so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances higher safety stock (to protect service given confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927, Period5\u21928, Period9 evidence) \u2014 actual lead time is sustained at 3. To ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicit=3. Demand history (samples mean=95.6) will be scaled by (1+L) inside backend, so I use default mu_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples with L=3. Volatility handled by backend default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to match the chosen L. This approach explicitly accounts for confirmed longer lead time and avoids under-ordering given large in-transit volume and service-level-driven q\u22480.95.

Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 3 periods consistently (evidence in history and carry-over). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time (avoids under-ordering due to promised L=2). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative aggregate forecast across the review+lead period). This balances high service level (profit/total cost \u2192 q\u22480.95) against holding cost by letting OR compute the safety stock using observed demand stats while accounting for the longer lead time and existing in-transit inventory.
