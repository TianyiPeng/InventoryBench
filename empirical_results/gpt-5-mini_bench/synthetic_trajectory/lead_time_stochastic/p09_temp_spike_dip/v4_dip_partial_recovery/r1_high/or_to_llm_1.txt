Current visible resources: on-hand=116 and in-transit=2041 (pipeline large). Even if some in-transit units may be lost, the visible pipeline plus on-hand far exceed the 3-period demand forecast, so ordering risks excessive ending inventory (holding cost) while providing little marginal profit benefit.
