Therefore do not assume lost shipments or changed lead time. 2) Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Historical sample mean across provided five-sample series = (82+89+65+106+136)/5 = 95.6 units/period, so (L+1)=3 period demand \u2248 287 units. Pipeline (275) is roughly equal to the 3-period requirement (short by ~12 units). 3) OR recommendation: OR caps orders to 22 units using its base-stock cap; it didn\u2019t account for possible late arrivals but did account for large pipeline. 4) Decision and justification: I order 0 units. Rationale: with pipeline already very large and holding cost = profit (high cost of overstock), the prudent choice is to avoid adding more inventory now. We wait one more period to observe Period 3 conclude (to confirm arrivals and any actual lead-time deviations) before committing additional replenishment. This minimizes holding cost risk while still likely satisfying near-term demand from in-transit stock. 5) Action tie-back: Follow OR's low-order intent but be more conservative (0 vs OR's 22) due to near-sufficient pipeline and equal profit/holding costs making overstock expensive.",

Step 3 - OR recommendation check: OR suggests 74 units. Adding 74 raises pipeline to 311, which covers ~3.25 periods at the historical mean \u2014 enough under promised lead time and closes the shortfall for L=2. Step 4 - Decision reasoning: Because we have only a single data point indicating lead_time=3 and many units already in-transit (some of which may still arrive), I will accept OR's capped recommendation of 74.
