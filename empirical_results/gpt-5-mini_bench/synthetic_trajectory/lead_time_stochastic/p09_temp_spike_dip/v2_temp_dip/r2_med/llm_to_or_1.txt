Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no conclude messages to infer lead-time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean 99.8 units; with promised L=2, the default (1+L)\xd7mean gives a 3-period demand forecast ~299.4. I choose default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses full-sample statistics and the promised lead time; this balances service (covers current+L periods) against holding cost given limited evidence of any regime or lead-time change.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=154. No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for the order placed in Period 1), so actual lead time is not confirmed \u2014 do not change promised lead time. Use default lead time (promised=2). Demand history (all samples: 118,130,72,58,121) shows mean ~99.8; with L=2 use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample demand) against holding cost while we wait for arrival confirmations; carry-over flags will be added only if a sustained pattern emerges.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=305 (matches orders 154+151). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2 (orders placed in P1/P2 should arrive during P3 but will only be visible in a conclude at P4). Historical demand samples: [118,130,72,58,121], mean\u224899.8, std\u224828.6. I use default lead time (promised L=2) because no concluded arrivals contradict it. mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given no confirmed regime change or lost shipments.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_4. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=354 (sum of orders P1=154,P2=151,P3=49). Period concludes show no arrivals for those orders -> shipments overdue vs promised L=2. No concluded arrival messages exist to compute actual lead time, so keep L as default (promised). Demand history (all samples) shows mean ~99.8; using default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) provides a stable aggregate forecast and volatility for the OR engine. This choice guards against overreacting to delayed arrivals while providing the backend with conservative base-stock sizing to balance service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (154,151,49 = 354 units) are overdue versus promised lead time 2; no concluded arrivals observed yet \u2014 possible sustained shipment delays.

Daily Profit: $424.00, Daily Holding Cost: $97.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent demand samples (118,130,72,58,121) show moderate variability. Concluded arrivals reveal mixed lead times (order P1 arrived in P4 \u2192 LT=3; order P3 arrived in P4 \u2192 LT=1), so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical LT. On-hand=97 + in-transit=151; some early orders were overdue vs promised LT=2 but P1 did eventually arrive (LT=3) \u2014 this motivates using calculated L to capture actual delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Recent concludes show variable actual lead times: an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3), and an order from Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=295 (includes overdue arrivals). Given inconsistent observed lead times, use averaged observed lead time to let the OR backend reconcile variability. Demand history (samples: 118,130,72,58,121) has no sustained (>3 periods) regime shift, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend compute base stock and cap balancing profit vs holding cost. This approach addresses possible delayed shipments by increasing effective lead time via the calculated average while keeping demand forecast conservative.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=442. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); some recent orders (e.g., P2, P5, P6) remain overdue vs promised L=2 but evidence is inconsistent (only two concluded lead times). I choose to let backend compute an average observed lead time (calculate) and use default demand/statistics so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (using observed lead-time signal) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=460. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (one order with LT=3 observed, one with LT=1). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): 118,130,72,58,121, plus later observed demands 106,132,80,72 \u2014 overall variability but no sustained regime shift. Some earlier shipments were overdue, but arrivals since Period_4 confirm lead-time variability; use average observed lead time to let backend adapt. Set L via calculate (average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start. On-hand=52, in-transit=298. Historical concluded lead times: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4 (LT=3), P3\u2192P4 (LT=1), P5\u2192P8 (LT=3), P7\u2192P8 (LT=1) \u2014 variability around promised 2 with average \u22482. Demand history shows no clear sustained upward/downward regime (samples remain volatile). To capture observed lead-time variability I let backend compute the empirical average lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level vs holding cost given moderate demand variability and the computed L. Using defaults avoids overfitting recent swings while letting the OR engine set base stock and cap with the inferred L.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=399. History of concluded arrivals shows mixed lead times (orders from P1,P5 had 3-period lead, P3,P7 had 1-period); average observed lead time = 2. Given persistent variability but average matching promised lead time, set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time data. Demand has recently averaged ~101 units/period (9 samples); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a stable forecast that covers the review+lead period and balances service vs holding cost while accounting for the observed lead-time variability and current large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=444. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {3,1,3,1} \u2192 average 2. Demand history (recent periods) is variable but not showing a sustained (>3 periods) regime shift. Given observed lead-time variability but average=2 (matches promised), I use calculated average lead time to let backend reflect actual observed LT. For demand I choose default (use all samples) because no sustained changepoint; this yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = default volatility scaling. This balances service (use observed LT) vs holding cost by not overreacting to short noisy fluctuations and relying on OR engine's base-stock math.

Use L method 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history shows stable ~100\u2013130 range; use mu_hat 'default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat 'default' (backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by targeting the base-stock from data-driven mean and variability while letting backend cap orders to control burst ordering given in-transit pipeline and potential delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent concluded history shows variable but persistently delayed arrivals (observed lead times: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P5->P8=3, P7->P8=1, P9->P12=3, P10->P12=2). On-hand=47, in-transit=298; some earlier orders were overdue vs promised L=2 and later concluded with L=3 multiple times. I set L method=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the slight upward drift vs promised 2). For demand I use mu_hat default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) based on the inferred L \u2014 this uses all historical demand (mean=99.8) to cover the review+lead horizon. Sigma_hat default lets the backend scale sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance raising target inventory to cover the longer realized lead time while relying on all available demand samples to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations and to mitigate risk from overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period4; Period5->Period8; Period9->Period12).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 77,89,96,99,85; mean=89.2) shows stable ~89 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=389 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely covering multiple periods but past history confirms actual lead time=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time (avoids underordering due to lost/delayed shipments). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the newest regime: mu_hat based on (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods to size replenishment across review+lead. Volatility also set recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. This balances service (higher L and recent demand mean raise base stock) against holding cost by using only the most recent 5 observations rather than all older data.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=389. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with observed lead times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.17) and prior confirmation of a 3-period lead in Period 13. Several past shipments were delayed versus promised L=2, so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time (calculate) to reflect observed variability. Demand history is limited to provided samples; use default (1+L)\xd7mean and default sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula with the inferred lead-time scaling, balancing service level (higher L raises mu_hat) against holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=429. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time ~3 periods (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12); shipments of 1\u20132 also occurred but 3 is dominant. Demand has trended near ~100 units in the last 5 concluded periods (P11\u2013P15). To protect service given observed LT=3 while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock and safety stock from the most recent demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: inventory on-hand=51, in-transit=343. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) despite some 1-2 period outliers; this indicates actual lead time is reliably 3 periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering given overdue/lost-shipment risk. For demand, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting it target the profit/holding tradeoff with the corrected lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16; 4 occurrences of LT=3 vs occasional 1-2 period outliers).

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent history shows multiple confirmed lead-time=3 occurrences and persistent delayed arrivals; on-hand=23, in-transit=375 (pipeline large). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained LT=3 regime (avoids underordering). Demand has been variable recently (Periods 13-17 demands = 85,86,134,40,33); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the latest regime and avoid dilution by older data. This balances service (higher L \u2192 larger (1+L) coverage) vs holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical concludes show repeated lead_time=3 (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16), and recent overdue arrivals earlier consistent with LT=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, scaling safety stock to the 4-period pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=420 units; recent demand samples show elevated variability but the most recent 5-period mean is low (Periods15-19). Historical concluded arrivals indicate a persistent lead time \u22483 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers the observed average lead time from concluded history (captures the confirmed LT=3 signal). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest regime (Periods15-19) where mean demand dropped; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples, sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This combination reduces over-ordering risk given large in-transit inventory while ensuring coverage over the inferred longer lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained lead time of 3 periods (multiple observed orders: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16). Pipeline (420) likely covers several periods of demand but promised LT=2 has been repeatedly violated. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed LT so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline delay. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample set\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and current large in-transit stock.

Historical concluded lead times show repeated LT=3 (multiple confirmations at P4,P8,P12,P16) with occasional 1-2 outliers; pipeline large so avoid assuming promised LT=2. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L), letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and the full historical demand samples.

To account for the confirmed longer lead time and let the OR engine compute demand across the review+lead horizon using all samples, set L explicit=3 and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This increases pipeline coverage for service while the OR engine's cap limits excess ordering to control holding cost.

Use observed lead-time average to capture this mix; retain default demand sizing (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical demand samples) and default volatility so OR engine applies its capped policy with the inferred L. This balances higher service need from confirmed LT\u22483 while letting the OR engine compute base stock from all demand samples and variance.

Historical conclude messages show repeated actual lead_time=3 (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16 observations) despite promised L=2; pipeline is large (420) so risk of overstock exists but service risk if we assume shorter L. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed sustained LT=3. For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative given limited sample set). This balances service (using observed LT=3) while letting the OR engine size safety stock from historical demand variance; with large in-transit inventory we avoid placing aggressive additional orders.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages show repeated lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed occurrences at P4, P8, P12, P16) indicating actual LT=3 > promised 2; shipments previously overdue. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed shipments and avoid under-ordering. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples (captures long-run demand ~81 units/period scaled for the 4-period review+lead). This increases pipeline coverage given delayed arrivals and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16). To account for confirmed LT=3 and ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level (covering extra lead time) against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent history and concluded messages (multiple observations P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) confirm actual lead time ~3 periods while promised=2. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=420 (likely includes multiple outstanding 3-period shipments). To avoid stockouts given confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so backend computes (1+L)-period demand properly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical samples to estimate (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances service level (higher coverage for longer LT) against holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand 0, in-transit 420 units; recent concluded history repeatedly shows actual lead times clustered at 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations) with occasional 1-2 period outliers. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let the backend capture the realized ~3-period behavior. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the longer inferred lead time and current large in-transit pipeline.

Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16). Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed LT and ensure pipeline covers (L+1) periods. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), balancing service vs. holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Historical concluded arrivals strongly support actual lead time = 3 (multiple observed P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 significant pipeline but no immediately available stock this period, so set L=3 to align forecast horizon with observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages all historical demand data while the explicit L corrects for persistent LT=3. This balances service (by matching true LT) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows multiple confirmed occurrences of actual lead time = 3 (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16); on-hand=0, in-transit=420. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed sustained LT=3 so the OR backend plans across the correct pipeline. Demand has no sharp recent structural break but recent periods are the best predictor, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (covers last 5 demand observations). This balances service level (accounting for longer LT) against holding costs by sizing base-stock to recent demand over the review+lead horizon and using recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand=0, in-transit=421; profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded lead times are mostly 3 with some 1\u20132 outliers (observations: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,1; avg\u22482.125). To reflect observed reality I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time (calculate). I use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples given the chosen L; this balances service (captures longer observed LT) while letting the backend cap orders to limit holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

To accommodate these sustained delays and ensure pipeline covers demand during the longer transit, I set L explicitly to 3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the base-stock policy and caps adjust ordering for the longer lead time and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent demand has averaged moderately (~70 units) with variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=421 (large pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 3 (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16), so I set L=3 explicitly. Use recent_N (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 31-35 demands: 84,62,58,93,52) so the OR engine sizes base stock to current demand and pipeline, avoiding excess holding while keeping service given long lead time.

Promised L=2 is unreliable; I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine forecasts pipeline correctly. Demand history (samples: 118,130,72,58,121) will be handled by default demand aggregation so mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures full review+lead demand with L=3). Volatility unknown beyond samples; use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). These choices compensate for delayed arrivals by increasing the review+lead coverage while letting the backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed LT=3 observations (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) so actual lead time is persistently 3 vs promised 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=421 which covers roughly (1+L)=4 periods of recent demand. Recent demand (Periods 33-37 = 58,93,52,94,62) avg \u2248 72; I use recent_N=5 to capture the current regime for mean and volatility. Set L explicit=3 to match observed LT=3 so mu_hat=(1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat scaled from recent std; this avoids under-ordering given delayed arrivals while limiting holding cost since pipeline already large.

Pipeline (421) likely covers several future periods; to ensure OR backend protects against observed LT=3 I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given no recent sustained demand regime shift. This balances service (using confirmed LT=3) versus holding cost by letting OR derive base_stock from combined historical mean/variance.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent demand average (Periods 35-39 = 52,94,62,105,112 \u2192 mean=85) suggests steady demand ~85 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (large pipeline) and historical conclues show consistent actual lead time = 3 periods. To reflect confirmed LT=3 and recent demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current mean over the most recent stable window: (1+L)*mean_recent = 4*85 = 340. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period demand horizon implied by LT=3 while using recent demand patterns to avoid over/under-stocking given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent demand steady high: last 5 demands (P36-P40)=94,62,105,112,104 (mean=95.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=3 in multiple occurrences; use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed shift. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). This yields a (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the most recent regime while relying on in-transit coverage; using recent_N reduces risk of overstock from older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=421. Historical conclude messages show repeated actual lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed occurrences), shipments often arrive 3 periods after order; promised LT=2 appears wrong. Demand recently averages ~102 units (Periods 37-41 = 62,105,112,104,129). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed LT=3 so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat equals (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands (captures current regime ~102 avg). Volatility also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variation. These choices protect service level given delayed shipments while limiting excess holding by using recent demand stats.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=452. Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent observations of actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16), so actual LT appears stably one period longer than promised. To ensure pipeline coverage we set L explicit=3. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level (covers extra lead time) against holding cost given limited new evidence of a demand regime shift.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=452. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16). Given repeated LT=3 evidence, set L=3 to align ordering horizon with real arrivals. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies the base-stock and cap formulas with the corrected lead time; this balances service level (meeting ~3-period ahead demand) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16; 4 occurrences of LT=3 vs occasional 1-2 period outliers).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=452. Historical conclude messages show repeated lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed occurrences), so use explicit L=3. Demand baseline from provided samples: mean \u224899.8; with L=3 the review+lead horizon is 4 periods, so default mu_hat (4\xd7mean) provides (conservative) coverage ~399 units; pipeline (452) currently exceeds that, so no aggressive increase. Use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample variability. These choices align OR base-stock with observed LT=3 while avoiding excess holding cost given current in-transit volume.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand 0 + in-transit 421 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals are observed with a confirmed 3-period lead time pattern. Multiple concluded messages (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P42->P45) indicate LT=3 is dominant; promised LT=2 underreports risk of stockout if used. I set L explicit=3 to align mu/sigma horizon with observed arrivals. Demand has been elevated recently (last 5 demands: 129,129,104,84,128); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the latest regime and balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 47. Recent demand has been elevated (~100+). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period deliveries\u2014use calculated average lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 5 demand observations (periods 42-46) so the base-stock reflects the current higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods. This balances service level (meet ~112 units demand) vs holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=494; historical concludes repeatedly show lead time = 3 (multiple confirmed occurrences through Period 45). Promised LT=2 but evidence supports using LT=3 to size pipeline. I set L=explicit 3 to capture the sustained 3-period lead time. For demand forecasting I use default methods so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine produce base-stock and cap consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. This addresses overdue shipments by extending coverage to (1+L) periods and keeps volatility estimates based on full history.

Period 49: recent demand has been consistently ~100 units/period (Periods 44-48: 84,128,119,101,81). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead time = 3 periods; use that to size the review+lead horizon (1+L=4). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed LT=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility on the most recent regime (last 5 periods) so the OR engine targets service for current demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering. This balances service level (using recent demand) against holding cost given sizable pipeline.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed sustained LT=3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples; this lets the backend incorporate the longer review+lead horizon while the large in-transit pipeline will limit orders via the capped policy, balancing service level vs holding cost.
