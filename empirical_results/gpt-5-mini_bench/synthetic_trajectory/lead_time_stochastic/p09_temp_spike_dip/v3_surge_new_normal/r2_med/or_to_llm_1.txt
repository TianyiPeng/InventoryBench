Lead-time evidence: Period4 conclude shows an order placed in Period1 arrived in Period4 \u2192 observed lead_time=3 for that shipment (one data point). However this is a single observation, so per carry-over rules we will not treat lead time change as confirmed (requires \u22653 periods). Inventory analysis: OR's base-stock cap ignores lost shipments and actual lead time, but current physical inventory (288 on-hand + 360 in-transit = 648 units) covers ~5.6 periods at mean demand (648/115.4 \u22485.6). Even if in-transit is delayed by an extra period or partially lost, on-hand alone (288) covers \u22482.5 periods, and recent demand was low (Period_5 demand=59). Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit \u2014 overstock is costly but stockouts are more damaging given profit ratio; OR's critical-fractile already balances that.

Do not trust promised L=2; treat new orders as arriving in 3 periods. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0 so current-period demand cannot be met; in-transit=200 equals the order placed in Period 17 and will arrive in Period 20 (after 3 periods). That means no replenishment will arrive to satisfy Periods 18\u201320 demands from new orders placed now. Demand assessment: historical baseline samples (given) are ~mean 115\u2013130, but recent two periods show large spikes (Period 16 demand=305, Period 17 demand=322). This is only two periods of elevated demand\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift per carry-over rules\u2014but it is a clear short-term risk of large stockouts. OR recommended 234 (uses promised L and historical mean); because actual lead time is longer (3) and near-term demand has spiked, OR's recommendation is too low. Ordering objective: cover expected demand until our next feasible arrival (orders placed now arrive in Period 21), i.e., cover Periods 18\u201321 (4 periods) plus safety. Given uncertainty and high short-run demand, I place a conservative but substantial order to rebuild pipeline: order 600 units.

{
  "rationale": "1) Lead-time inference: Concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Treat promised L=2 as incorrect and use L=3 for planning. 2) Current inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=920. With L=3, decision must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand after ordering because current period demand occurs post-decision. 3) Demand outlook: recent sustained demand (Periods 16\u201349) averages ~115\u2013130 units/period (many periods in 100\u2013150 range). Using a conservative single-period mean ~125 implies 4-period demand \u2248 500 units. 4) Pipeline assessment: in-transit=920 >> required 4-period coverage (~500), so incoming stock already more than covers near-term demand. Ordering additional units now would only increase ending inventory and incur holding cost ($1/unit/period) without increasing near-term sales. 5) Profit/holding tradeoff: profit $4 per unit vs holding $1 implies some safety stock is justified, but current pipeline already provides large buffer (920). 6) OR recommendation was 0; I agree and place 0 to avoid excess holding cost and potential obsolescence. 7) No new carry-over insight to record (no \u22653-period new sustained shift beyond what is already recorded).",
