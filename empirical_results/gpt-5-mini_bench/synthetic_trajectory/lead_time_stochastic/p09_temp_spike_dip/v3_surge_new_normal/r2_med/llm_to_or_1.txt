Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical samples available (146,110,112,150,59). No evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change (only 5 samples, no sustained change). Use default lead time (promised L=2) so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level using historical mean/variance without overreacting to limited data.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Historical demand samples mean=115.4 (n=5). On-hand=0, in-transit=176 (order placed Period_1) but no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) because only concluded messages establish lead-time changes. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding cost given limited evidence and the outstanding in-transit shipment.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=352 (orders from prior periods not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals yet to confirm a lead-time change, so use promised lead time. Historical demand mean = 115.4 (5 samples). Using default computations with L=promised (default) gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std to capture variability. This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=413. Historical concluded demand (Periods 1-3) = 140,136,92 (mean=122.7) \u2014 recent demand shows slight downward shift in Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 but no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (expected arrivals by Periods 3-4) indicating delayed/lost shipments; nonetheless actual lead time not conclusively measured by a completed arrival. I choose L=default to let backend use the promised lead time while preserving compatibility. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to weight the most recent three observed demands (captures recent lower demand in Period 3) and reduce risk of overstock given large in-transit. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to recent demand while acknowledging outstanding in-transit pipeline and potential shipment issues.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded by their promised arrival windows (promised LT=2) \u2014 sustained absence of arrivals across 3 periods suggests delayed or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $232.00, Daily Holding Cost: $179.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5: 146,110,112,150,59) show mean ~115; current on-hand=179 and in-transit=176 (some late arrivals just posted in Period 4 conclude). Observed concluded lead times: 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4) \u2014 average ~2, so I use the backend-calculated lead time to respect variability. I choose default demand and volatility methods so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given current substantial on-hand + pipeline. This avoids overreacting to mixed/limited lead-time evidence while the system reconciles in-transit confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $411.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=61, in-transit=327. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4) and an outstanding order from Period_5 (ordered=151, arrived=0). Given mixed evidence but no sustained alternative lead-time regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend can average observed values. Demand samples (146,110,112,150,59) give mean\u2248115.4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the standard base-stock formula while respecting estimated lead time. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost while accounting for possible delayed shipments.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=444. Historical demand samples mean=115.4 (periods 1\u20135). Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (order P1\u2192arrived P4) and 1 (order P3\u2192arrived P4); average observed lead time = 2. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses average observed lead time. Demand forecasting uses 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to capture full review+lead coverage given lead-time uncertainty; sigma uses 'default' to scale historical variability by sqrt(1+L). This keeps base-stock responsive to the observed mixed lead times while not overreacting to possibly lost/delayed shipments, relying on pipeline + in-transit visibility for replenishment.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=500. Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (observed 3 and 1) but average ~2; past missing shipments noted but arrivals resumed in Period 4. Demand recent periods (P1\u2013P7) are moderate (~100s). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average, and keep mu_hat/sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for lead-time-adjusted demand while avoiding overreacting to possibly transient shipment variability.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,1 \u2192 average 2.0). Demand history (samples: 146,110,112,150,59) has no sustained new regime; current on-hand=85, in-transit=293 (pipeline large). Given observed lead times average equals promised (2), use calculated average lead time to reflect evidence. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this keeps forecast conservative given large pipeline and avoids overreacting to short spikes or earlier delayed shipments. No new sustained pattern beyond previously recorded missing shipments.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=410. Historical concluded lead times observed = {3,1,3,1} (avg=2) so no persistent deviation from promised LT=2; earlier missing shipments (Periods 1\u20133) resolved by later arrivals but monitor for future loss. Demand history available; no sustained demand regime change detected. Choices: L set to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time average (captures recent variability); mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given current profit/holding ratio and uncertain but centering lead time estimate. These params keep orders responsive to observed lead-time variability while avoiding overstock given holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=493. Historical concluded lead times observed: P1\u2192P4 LT=3, P3\u2192P4 LT=1, P5\u2192P8 LT=3, P7\u2192P8 LT=1 (avg=2). Recent demand sample mean=115.4 (samples:146,110,112,150,59). Given mixed observed lead times but average ~2, use calculate for L so backend uses empirical lead-time average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This balances service level (use observed lead-time) with holding cost given current large in-transit volume and demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: observed LT values = 3 (P1\u2192P4), 1 (P3\u2192P4), 3 (P5\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8); average LT = 2 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Current on-hand=72, in-transit=349. Concluded history shows observed lead times: P1\u2192P4=3, P3\u2192P4=1, P5\u2192P8=3, P7\u2192P8=1, P9\u2192P12=3, P10\u2192P12=2 (avg \u22482.17). Several past periods had delayed arrivals or missing shipments; pipeline is large but arrivals have been variable. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures LT variability > promised 2). Demand sample set is small (5 seed samples), so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' letting backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given higher effective lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-run noise.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent observed lead times = {P1\u2192P4:3, P3\u2192P4:1, P5\u2192P8:3, P7\u2192P8:1, P9\u2192P12:3, P10\u2192P12:2} \u2192 average \u2248 2.17. Demand samples mean = 115.4 (samples: 146,110,112,150,59). On-hand=0, in-transit=396 which exceeds (1+avg_LT)*mean \u2248 3.17*115.4 \u2248 366, so pipeline appears sufficient despite past missing shipments. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses the empirical average; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std given the chosen L, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed LTs include 3,1,3,1,3,2) with average \u22482 \u2014 use calculated average lead time to reflect observed distribution.

This choice acknowledges delayed/lost shipments in earlier periods by letting L reflect actual observed LTs rather than the promised value.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent history shows highly variable lead times (observed Ls include 1,2,3) and substantial in-transit volume (409) with on-hand = 0; demand has occasional spikes (Period16 demand=305) but not a sustained new regime. Given mixed observed lead times, use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times rather than trusting promised LT=2. Demand statistics are unchanged (no sustained 3+ period shift), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance while accounting for the averaged lead time. This balances service (capturing variable LT via calculated L) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Recent demand has spiked (last 5 demands: P13\u2013P17 = 55, 98, 77, 305, 322) so forecast should reflect elevated demand. Observed lead times in concluded messages are variable (sequence of observed Ls = 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3); average > promised. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the clear recent high-demand regime. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent demand variation. These choices increase base stock to protect service during the recent demand surge while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive holding given high holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent clustering of 3-period lead times: orders P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17 observed LT=3 (3 occurrences), indicating recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=878. Recent concluded lead-time evidence shows clustering of 3-period arrivals (orders P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) so I set lead time to 3 to protect against delayed arrivals. Demand has jumped in the last 3 periods (Period_16=305, Period_17=322, Period_18=219); I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to scale (1+L) forecast toward the new high-demand regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture elevated volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service while acknowledging higher holding cost via the backend cap.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 with high demands (P16=305, P17=322, P18=219, P19=194) \u2014 a clear changepoint vs. prior low/mid demand. Lead-time history shows a recent clustering of 3-period arrivals (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirms tendency). To protect service while many units are still in-transit, I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201319). For demand volatility I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated variance in the same recent window. These choices increase the base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and higher recent demand, balancing profit-driven service against holding cost given large in-transit exposure.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent history shows large, volatile demands (many periods of stockout) and confirmed clustering of 3-period lead times in recent concluded arrivals (Periods 9\u219212,13\u219216,14\u219217). On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 (many units likely arriving beyond promised windows historically). To protect service given observed LT=3 clustering, I set L explicitly to 3. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples so the base-stock reflects the longer effective lead time while relying on the full-sample demand estimates.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent demand regime: six consecutive high-demand periods (P16\u2013P21) with very large sales vs prior history. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1221 (large pipeline likely tied to earlier large orders). Historical concluded lead times show a recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals. To protect service during this sustained high-demand regime and given observed 3-period deliveries, set lead time explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans for a longer coverage window. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this leverages full-sample stats while L=3 expands the review+lead coverage). This balances higher fill-rate (profit>holding cost) against holding costs given a large in-transit balance; keeping mu_hat/sigma_hat default avoids overfitting short-term noise while L=3 accounts for observed arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand increased from 98.5 (P1\u2013P15) to 245.0 (P16\u2013P21), +149% \u2014 sustained high-demand regime (6 periods).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (avg ~245 over P16\u2013P21) and multiple confirmed 3-period lead-time arrivals in recent windows. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 (large pipeline). To protect service during recent LT=3 clusters I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (the recent high-demand regime length P16\u2013P22) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 7 demands; sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture recent volatility. This increases safety stock to cover the higher demand and longer effective lead time while the large in-transit pipeline will be considered by the OR engine when capping orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: recent demand has stayed in the high regime since Period 16 (periods 16\u201323 high demands: 305,322,219,194,235,195,252,211). On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past shipments were delayed (multiple orders arrived with LT=3 recently). I set L using recent_N to reflect the recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (N=8, Periods 16\u201323) so mu_hat forecasts (1+L)*mean of the recent high-demand samples. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given sustained elevated demand and observed longer lead times, while sigma based on recent variance controls the safety-stock sizing.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221, recent demand regime has shifted up since Period 16 (sustained high demand). Historical concluded lead times show clustering at 3 periods recently (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) so I estimate lead time using recent observations. Set L using recent_N to capture the recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 9 demand samples (Periods 16\u201324) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (mean \u2248241 units). Sigma is set using recent_N over the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices increase the backend base-stock to service the higher demand regime while acknowledging longer recent lead times and avoiding under-ordering given many in-transit units and past missing/delayed shipments.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: recent periods (P16\u2013P25) show a sustained high-demand regime (avg much higher than P1\u2013P15) and recent arrivals indicate lead times clustering at 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 (large pipeline). To protect service during confirmed higher demand and observed 3-period arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=10) to compute mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 demands) and sigma_hat as recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting elevated demand while accounting for the longer observed lead time and large pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent data shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (avg ~234.3 over P16\u2013P26). Multiple concluded arrivals indicate lead times trending to 3 periods recently. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 units \u2014 pipeline comfortably exceeds (1+L)*recent mean if L=3, so we can cover near-term demand while acknowledging past delayed shipments. Choices: set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed clustering of 3-period arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 11 periods (P16\u2013P26) to anchor forecasts to the confirmed high-demand regime. This increases service-level targeting for the current higher demand while the large in-transit position limits additional ordering and containing holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical conclues show recent clustering of 3-period lead times and a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 16 (avg demand ~245). Promised LT=2 but evidence supports LT\u22483 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering given long/variable transit. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201327) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to capture current volatility. This increases target base-stock to protect service level while the explicit L accounts for delayed shipments and the recent-demand statistics limit overreaction to older low-demand data.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (avg ~245 over P16\u2013P28). Recent conclude history shows a clustering of 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and prolonged missing/delayed shipments earlier, so I conservatively set lead time to 3 to ensure pipeline covers longer arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent demand regime (use last 13 periods P16\u2013P28) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This increases ordered coverage for the (1+L)-period review+lead window and protects service level given observed delays, while letting the capped order limit restrain excessive orders given holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (mean jumped ~+149%) and recent clustering toward longer lead times (multiple observed L=3 in latest concludes). To reflect recent lead-time behavior I use recent_N for L (captures latest observed Ls). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to target the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201321 and nearby), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward larger replenishment to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while the recent_N sigma stabilizes safety stock given observed variability.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (avg ~245 over P16\u2013P21) though recent six periods (P25\u2013P30) show more variable but still elevated demand (294,113,145,184,133,80). On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 \u2014 large pipeline likely from prior large orders but many past shipments were delayed; recent history shows a clustering of 3-period lead times. To protect service given evidence of LT=3 clustering and the risk of delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=6) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent demand behavior and volatility (captures the post-shift variability and recent lower spikes). This raises target pipeline for coverage while using recent samples to avoid overreacting to older extreme values. These choices favor higher service (profit per unit $4 >> holding $1) while limiting excessive holding by basing mu_hat/sigma_hat on the recent 6 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concludes show recent tendency toward 3-period lead times and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (avg demand rose ~+149%). Given large pipeline but delayed arrivals, set L to reflect recent observed lead-time cluster. For demand I use recent samples to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 16 periods, Period 16\u201331). sigma_hat also uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock (to meet elevated demand and compensate for longer effective lead time) while capping orders via the engine's cap to limit excess holding given the large in-transit volume.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33: On-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 16 (elevated mean ~245) and recent clustering of 3-period lead times. Many prior promised arrivals were delayed but in-transit volume is large. To reflect the recent LT behavior I set L using recent lead-time observations. For demand I use a recent_N window covering the high-demand regime (Period16 onward) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to target a larger base-stock for the sustained high-demand while acknowledging longer recent lead times so pipeline coverage is increased; this balances lost sales (high profit) against holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical conclues show a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (avg demand rose materially) and recent lead-time clustering at 3 periods. Promised LT=2 but recent evidence supports using LT=3 to ensure pipeline covers arrivals. I set L=explicit 3 to reflect recent 3-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (covers Periods 16\u201333 high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the sustained elevated demand over the last 18 periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=18 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders upward to avoid stockouts under longer actual LT while the sigma choice keeps the OR safety stock responsive to recent variability.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: recent demand regime (Period_16\u201334) is much higher than early periods (sustained high demand since P16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 \u2014 substantial pipeline but prior history shows shipments delayed (recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals). I set lead time L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed clustering of 3-period arrivals and to avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=9) to base mu_hat on the most recent 9 demand samples (captures current high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand data). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=9) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to meet sustained elevated demand and compensate for delayed arrivals while keeping variability estimates grounded in recent observations.

To protect service during sustained high demand and account for recent 3-period arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand, use recent_N over the last 20 post-changepoint samples (Periods 16\u201335) so mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices increase target pipeline to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while recognizing elevated lead-time risk from delayed arrivals.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (confirmed in history). Recent concluded arrivals show a clustering of 3-period lead times, so I use a short recent average for L. To capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201336) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 20 demand samples (regime length capped at 20) so the OR backend builds base-stock targeting the new mean and recent volatility. On-hand=0 and in-transit=1221 will be reconciled by the backend; using recent_N for mu/sigma avoids underordering into the higher-demand regime while L=recent_N accounts for observed LT=3 tendency.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals recently (many orders ending up LT=3) and several lost/delayed shipments earlier. Promised LT=2 but recent pattern favors LT=3; set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery behavior so the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. Demand regime shifted up around Period 16 and recent periods remain elevated; to capture the most recent demand level I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the latest 5 observed demands) so the base-stock and cap reflect current demand and volatility while avoiding dilution by very old low-demand samples. This balances service (reduce stockouts given long LT and high demand) against holding cost by limiting smoothing to recent data.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: demand has sat in a higher regime since Period 16 (avg \u2248245) and recent arrivals show a tendency toward 3-period lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 (large pipeline). I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent clustering of 3-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor mu_hat to the sustained high-demand regime (use regime-length capped at 20). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to meet elevated demand while respecting the observed longer lead times and large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concluded lead times show variability with average \u22482.38; many recent 3-period arrivals. Demand regime shifted higher from Period 16 onward and recent periods (P20\u2013P39) remain elevated vs P1\u2013P15. To reflect observed lead-time variability use calculated average lead time so the OR engine accounts for empirical L. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N=20 to weight the recent high-demand regime (captures most recent ~20 demands) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given large in-transit volume against holding cost risk.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concluded arrivals show clustering of 3-period lead times recently (multiple orders with LT=3). Many earlier promised arrivals were delayed/lost, so use explicit L=3 to reflect current delivery reality. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16; to capture recent pattern variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 demand samples (recent_N N=20) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on current demand levels and variability while leveraging the large in-transit balance to avoid over-ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concluded lead times are variable but average >2; sustained demand regime shift to higher demand from Period_16 onward (documented). To account for observed lead-time variability use calculate for L so backend averages observed Ls. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 (use the last 20 demand samples) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the current high-demand regime and reduce stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (carry-over noted: avg ~245 over P16\u2013P21 and elevated thereafter). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1221 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past shipments were delayed/lost (multiple late arrivals and gaps). Recent evidence shows a tendency toward 3-period actual lead times (clusters of LT=3 in recent history), so I set lead time = 3 to protect against under-ordering given delayed arrivals. To capture the sustained high-demand regime while weighting recent behavior, I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 20 samples). This choice ensures the base-stock reflects recent elevated demand and increased uncertainty, while the larger in-transit position prevents overreacting to temporary gaps; using recent samples helps the OR engine balance service level (higher mu_hat \u2192 higher base stock) against holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (confirmed earlier); recent concluded arrivals show a tendency toward 3-period lead times and multiple missing/delayed shipments historically. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1221 (large pipeline). To protect service given observed delayed arrivals and the recent cluster of 3-period LTs, set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (more weight on recent high-volume periods) so the OR engine raises base stock and caps appropriately while balancing holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (avg ~245) and recent clustering of 3-period lead times. Pipeline (1221 units) is large vs recent per-period demand (~110\u2013294) but unknown actual LT variability means we should treat lead time as recently longer. I set L using recent lead-time observations to capture the recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N window (N=20) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 and to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts under the sustained high-demand regime while using recent volatility to moderate the safety stock given holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 \u2014 large pipeline but many past shipments were delayed/lost (sustained missing arrivals observed early; recent arrivals show mixed LT). Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has stayed high (sustained). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history average (reflecting the recent mix of 1\u20133 period LTs). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to force the backend to base mu_hat on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the sustained high-demand regime since Period 16). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given high recent demand) while relying on the backend's computed base-stock and cap to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47: recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (avg demand ~245) and multiple recent observations of 3-period lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=1221 (large pipeline; some past shipments were delayed). To protect service during remaining horizon and reflect observed LT clustering, set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N (last 20 periods) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (reduces influence of earlier low-demand periods). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR baseline stock upward to meet high demand while using recent data to avoid over/understating variability given delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concludes show recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. To reflect recent lead-time behavior I set L using recent lead-time observations (short window). For demand I use a recent_N window covering the sustained high-demand regime (capped at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the elevated mean and volatility. The large in-transit volume (1221) likely covers multiple review+lead periods; these parameter choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping volatility estimated from recent data to limit excessive safety stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concludes show variable lead times with recent clustering of 3-period arrivals (Periods 9\u219212,13\u219216,14\u219217) and earlier sustained missing/delayed shipments. Demand has settled lower recently (last 5 periods demands = 118,130,106,151,126; mean \u2248126). To protect against observed 3-period arrivals I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use a recent_N (N=5) demand forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to the most recent demand level and volatility rather than the older high-demand spike (Periods 16\u201325). This balances service (accounting for longer observed arrivals and large in-transit) against holding cost by aligning forecast horizon with recent demand and the inferred longer LT.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=1221. Historical concludes show variable lead times with recent tendency toward 3-period arrivals and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (higher mean). Pipeline is large (1221) so we avoid ordering more; but we must tell the OR engine that effective lead time may differ from promised and that demand remains in the high regime. Set L by averaging observed lead times (use backend calculation). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime (use last 20 samples to capture sustained elevated demand while smoothing variability). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices prevent underordering given longer/variable arrivals and target service given high demand while letting the engine cap orders using its internal cap.
