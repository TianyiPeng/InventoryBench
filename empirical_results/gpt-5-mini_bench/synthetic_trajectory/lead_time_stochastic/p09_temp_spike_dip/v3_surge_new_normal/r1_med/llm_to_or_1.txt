Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) available with mean = (146+110+112+150+59)/5 = 115.4. Promised lead time is 2 periods and there is no evidence to override it. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level (profit=4 vs holding=1) via backend's analytic base-stock formula.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 context: promised lead time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=176 (ordered P1). Historical demand samples mean=115.4 units/period; with (1+L)=3 periods the default forecast implies ~346.2 units over review+lead. No concluded arrivals yet to suggest lead-time change or lost shipment. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time; this keeps target base-stock aligned with long-run observed demand while the existing in-transit order is monitored for late arrival evidence.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. Recent historical demand samples (all-period mean \u2248115.4) will be used with promised lead time since no concluded arrivals confirm a lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=344 equals orders from P1+P2 (176+168) and these remain overdue but not yet confirmed lost\u2014insufficient evidence to change lead-time. Use default L (promised=2) so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances service level vs holding cost given current profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (orders from P1:176, P2:168, P3:25) with no concluded arrivals through Period_3 \u2014 three consecutive periods with no arrivals despite promised L=2, signaling either longer lead time or lost shipments. Historical demand samples (used by default methods) have mean=115.4 units. To be conservative given missing arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using all samples, balancing service level (higher base stock due to longer L) against holding cost given stated profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in P1-P3 (176, 168, 25) remain in-transit (369 total) with no arrivals by Period_3 conclude => actual lead time appears >2 or shipments lost (sustained for 3 periods).

Daily Profit: $412.00, Daily Holding Cost: $98.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: recent concluded data show one order with lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4) and one with lead_time=1 (P3\u2192P4); P2 remains unconfirmed (likely delayed earlier). Demand samples mean = (146+110+112+150+59)/5 = 115.4 units/period. On-hand=98, in-transit=285. To let the OR engine infer a sensible effective lead time from observed concludes, I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1 and 3 signals). For demand and volatility I use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances using full history given limited data and recent mixed lead-time evidence. This approach keeps orders conservative given the in-transit backlog and past missing/delayed arrivals, reducing risk of stockouts while avoiding excessive explicit overrides.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=383, recent demand samples = [146,110,112,150,59]. History shows mixed lead-times (P1\u2192P4 arrived, lead_time=3; P3\u2192P4 arrived, lead_time=1) so actual lead time is variable. Several shipments were overdue earlier and remain in-transit, so use calculated lead time from observed conclues to let backend infer the empirical average. Demand forecast uses all samples (default) because no sustained demand regime change is evident (the low Period_5 demand is a single-period dip). Volatility uses all samples (default). These choices balance service level (use observed lead-time average) against holding cost by not overreacting to a single-period demand drop.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=479; recent concludes show arrivals with lead_times observed = 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4) and several overdue/no-arrival events earlier, indicating lead time variability and some delayed shipments. I choose L.method='calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times average (captures confirmed 3-period event without overcommitting). For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples (samples: 146,110,112,150,59) \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead times and limited on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Recent history shows volatile demand (samples: 146,110,112,150,59) and prolonged in-transit volumes (369) with small on-hand (6). Concluded arrivals reveal actual lead times observed: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1, P4->P7 = 3 \u2192 average observed lead time \u22482.33, with repeated 3-period delays. To capture the longer/mixed lead-time regime I ask backend to compute L from observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecasting I use the default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) which uses full sample history to smooth volatility given limited data. Sigma_hat default retains full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination signals the OR engine to raise base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while using full-sample stats to avoid overreacting to the recent low sample.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as often 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived in P4, P4 order arrived in P7); average observed lead time \u22482.33 over 3 observed arrivals.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=10, in-transit=374. Historical arrivals show variable but predominantly 3-period lead times (several P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) with some 1-period anomalies. I will let the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals to capture the empirical lead-time (use 'calculate'). Demand history (samples provided) will be used in full to compute (1+L)\xd7mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat (use 'default') so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using all data while the backend-adjusted L reflects recent delayed shipments. This preserves safety against missing shipments while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. On-hand + in-transit (384 total) currently covers multiple periods of expected demand but delayed arrivals earlier justify using observed lead-time for future ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} (avg=2.0). On-hand=64, in-transit=360 (several past delayed shipments but arrivals have been observed). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures realized 2.0). Demand history samples (146,110,112,150,59) show no sustained recent regime shift, so use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (uses observed longer lead time) vs holding cost by increasing coverage for longer pipeline while keeping demand estimate based on full sample.

Several past shipments were delayed/lost, so I set L to the calculated average observed lead time to reflect realized delivery behavior. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7sample std (all samples) \u2014 this yields a demand forecast and variability scaled for the inferred lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given the existing large pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=458. Historical conclude messages show multiple delayed arrivals (observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,1) indicating actual lead time differs from promised. I choose L: calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times from concluded arrivals (captures mixed 1\u20133p patterns). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively; this balances service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) while letting the OR engine compute base stock and the capped order given the large in-transit pipeline. Using calculate for L helps the backend account for observed lead-time drift and avoid underordering given many overdue shipments.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=20, in-transit=335. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed values include 1,2,3 periods) with multiple 3-period arrivals and several lost/delayed shipments earlier; pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain. To let the OR engine adapt to observed lead-time variability, set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Demand history is limited to the provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2 -> avg\u22482.125) and intermittent missing/late shipments earlier. Demand samples (seed data) show mean \u2248115.4 over provided samples. I choose to let the backend calculate a data-driven lead time average (method=calculate) to capture the observed variability rather than trusting the promised 2. For demand and volatility I use the defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the OR engine applies the standard base-stock calculation with the inferred lead time; this balances service-level (using observed longer lead times) against holding cost given limited on-hand and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=368. History shows many concluded arrivals with observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3] (avg \u22482.22) indicating realized lead time > promised 2. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time. Recent demand has variability; to capture the latest regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent 5 demand samples. This balances service (longer realized lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit and zero on-hand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=450. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (several P1->P4, P4->P7, P11->P14, P9->P12) with occasional 1-2 period cases; average observed lead time >2. To capture actual lead-time behavior I ask backend to calculate L from observed lead times. Demand samples (provided) have mean ~115; I'll use the default aggregators so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (captures longer observed lead time via calculate L) vs holding cost by using standard demand stats rather than overreacting to recent noise. No explicit adjustments despite overdue/irregular arrivals because losses/delays are reflected in observed lead times used by 'calculate'.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=360. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed 3s recently) so I set L to recent_N to reflect the longer empirical lead time. Use N=5 to average the most recent observed lead times (captures the sustained pattern of 3-period arrivals while smoothing occasional 1s/2s). Demand regime has not shown a sustained (3+ period) shift despite a single large spike, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR backend compute base stock and cap accordingly.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=470. Recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times; last 5 observed lead times = [3,3,3,3,2] -> avg\u22482.8, so I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect slowed/variable lead time. Demand has risen and been volatile since ~Period 15 (demands: P10-17 = 156,109,103,92,97,128,263,223); I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts over the (1+L) review+lead horizon using the latest regime. This balances higher service needs (large recent demand spikes) against holding cost; large in-transit inventory (470) will be reconciled by the backend order cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent demand has spiked sharply (Periods 16-18 demands: 263, 223, 245). On-hand=0, in-transit=629 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period lead time in recent history, so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid underordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the three most recent high-demand periods, capturing the current elevated regime. I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These settings increase safety stock to protect service during the verified longer lead time and recent demand surge while the OR backend balances profit vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods: observed arrivals with lead_time=3 include orders (P1->P4), (P4->P7), (P5->P8), (P9->P12), (P13->P16), (P14->P17) \u2014 consistent 3-period pattern over 6 arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=906. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=3 across many orders (Periods 1->4,4->7,5->8,9->12,13->16,14->17, etc.), so actual lead time is 3. To protect against stockouts given recent large demand (Periods 15-19 = 128,263,223,245,218), set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N=5 (captures the current high-demand regime: mean \u2248215.4 over last 5 periods \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248862) and set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect elevated volatility. These choices raise base-stock to meet service needs while acknowledging higher holding cost via the OR cap.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=950. Historical concluded arrivals overwhelmingly show a 3-period lead time (multiple confirmed P->P+3 arrivals through Period 19) and many earlier delayed/lost shipments; to protect service level given observed pattern I set lead time to 3 explicitly. Using default demand/volatility calculation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of provided samples) lets the OR backend compute base stock and cap with the larger review+lead horizon, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while avoiding aggressive overordering given large in-transit volume.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 22. Recent history shows a sustained shift to longer lead times (multiple arrivals with lead_time=3) and a clear rise in demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 16-21: 263,223,245,218,247,324). On-hand=0, in-transit=950 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period actual lead time so the OR backend plans for the correct replenishment delay and avoids stockouts. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 periods) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 so variability reflects the same recent regime. This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand and longer lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=1078. Historical conclude messages consistently show a 3-period actual lead time over many arrivals (evidence in history up to Period 19). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine will size orders for the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L=3 this captures demand across review+lead and preserves the engine's cap logic. Large in-transit balance reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

Many earlier shipments were delayed/lost when assuming promised L=2; to avoid stockouts given large pipeline and observed 3-period arrival pattern, I set L explicit=3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all provided demand samples (conservative aggregate forecast) which balances service level (captures longer L) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=906. Concluded history shows consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 through Period_19). Many recent stockouts indicate elevated demand and/or delayed arrivals; to ensure pipeline covers review+lead horizon I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures full-sample demand estimate scaled for L=3). This raises target base-stock to cover 4 periods of demand, prioritizing service given recurring 3-period delays while leveraging in-transit inventory to limit excess holding.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and ensure the OR engine sizes orders to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given the confirmed lead-time regime; this balances higher safety stock needed for longer effective lead time against holding cost while leveraging observed demand stats.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=906. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 16 (periods 16-26 demand mostly 119\u2013324, average materially above early-sample mean) and multiple confirmed lead-time=3 arrivals (consistent pattern through Period 19). Many earlier orders experienced delays/losses, so assume actual lead time = 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 16\u201326 constitute a sustained high-demand regime; N = regime_length = 11) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to capture current volatility. These choices force the OR engine to size base-stock for the longer confirmed lead time and the elevated recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding rates.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=1040. History of concluded arrivals shows many lead_time=3 observations (multiple periods) with mixed occasional 1-2s; average observed lead time > promised 2. To account for sustained longer transit times I let the backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). I use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all respectively; this lets the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order while using the inferred actual lead time. This balances higher safety stock needs from longer lead times against holding cost given profit/holding=$4/$1.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=1040. Historical conclues show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3), so set lead time to 3. Demand has shifted up starting Period_16 (sustained high demands); I use a recent-N forecast to capture the new regime. Chosen parameters: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period actual lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=11 using Periods 16\u201326 (captures (1+L)\xd7mean over the new high-demand regime); sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices align pipeline coverage with the longer confirmed lead time and raise the base-stock to reduce stockouts while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand Periods 16\u201326 = 239.36 vs earlier baseline avg (Periods 1\u20135) = 115.4 (+107%), sustained over 11 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=6, in-transit=906. Historical conclues show a sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P->P+3). Demand regime shift at Period 16 raised mean demand substantially (recorded in history). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and rely on all available demand data, set L explicit=3 so the OR engine sizes cover the longer pipeline; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=906. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained lead-time=3 pattern and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 16 (avg Periods16\u201326 \u2248239). Many earlier promised LT=2 shipments arrived with LT=3; use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed reality and avoid under-ordering. Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=15) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (periods 16\u201330) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last 15 samples). Volatility: use recent_N N=15 for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service during high-demand regime while accounting for holding cost via OR's z* cap.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. On-hand=0, in-transit=951 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period lead-time pattern across many arrivals (average >2); demand shifted up around Period 16 and remained elevated for ~11 periods. To reflect confirmed longer lead time, set L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. To target the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the elevated demand from Periods 16\u201326. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the longer lead time and higher recent demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=906. Historical concludes show a persistent lead-time=3 pattern (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (higher mean). To account for confirmed longer lead time and recent high-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3. I forecast demand over review+lead using the recent high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201332) so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=17 (captures the sustained elevated mean). Volatility should reflect the same regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=17. These choices ensure the OR engine targets service levels appropriate for the confirmed 3-period lead time and elevated demand while avoiding understock given large in-transit volume and past lost/delayed shipments.

Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple P->P+3 arrivals); promised=2 appears stale. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201333, regime length=18) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand mean and volatility and help the OR engine size base-stock to meet service while accounting for higher holding cost.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time from multiple arrivals; use recent_N N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201326 length=11). This increases target base-stock to meet service under longer lead time while sigma recent_N captures elevated demand variability; large in-transit reduces immediate order quantity risk.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 starting: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time pattern (multiple confirmed P->P+3 arrivals across history). Many large orders remain in-transit and likely to arrive with L=3. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201335 = 144,79,126,103,98,131) shows a lower regime (~114 mean) versus the earlier high-demand regime; I therefore forecast using the most recent 6 periods to capture current demand level and volatility. Setting L explicit=3 aligns OR's review+lead period with observed deliveries, while recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat reduces overstating demand from the earlier high regime and keeps inventory from ballooning given holding cost=$1. This balances service (use observed longer lead time) against holding cost by sizing the base stock to recent demand and realized variability.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concludes show a persistent lead-time=3 modal pattern (many arrivals with W=3; average observed \u22482.33) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (avg Periods16\u201326 \u2248239). Large in-transit balance suggests prior orders still en route under multi-period lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the confirmed longer lead time). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the post-shift high-demand regime (Periods16\u201326 length=11), giving (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility that reflect the higher sustained demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise. This balances service (higher base stock for higher demand/longer lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to match confirmed actual lead time so arrivals/pipeline are aligned. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201326 evidence) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of recent high-demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect realized volatility in that same regime. These choices bias orders toward higher safety stock to avoid stockouts given long lead time and high demand while the cap will limit extreme ordering to control holding cost.

Historical concludes show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) and many prior missing/delayed shipments; set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338 = 98,131,129,144,109) averages ~122; to focus the forecast on the current lower post-spike regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=5 (covers last 5 observed demands). These choices (L=3, mu_hat recent_N N=5, sigma_hat recent_N N=5) make the OR backend size base stock for a 4-period demand window and use recent mean/variance to limit overstock from past high-demand episodes while accounting for the longer realized lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (avg ~239 vs baseline ~115); recent history and carry-over insights confirm higher-demand regime. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=910 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals follow 3-period lead time so not yet visible on-hand. To ensure the OR backend sizes orders for the high-demand regime and accounts for confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N to target the post-change regime (use N=11 reflecting Periods 16\u201326 regime length) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed from the elevated-demand samples. These choices align safety stock with higher demand and the observed longer lead time while avoiding reliance on stale low-demand data.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: On-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). Given large in-transit position and persistent 3-period pattern, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses measured average (captures confirmed 3). Demand has been elevated and variable since Period 16 but recent periods (P31\u2013P40) show moderate demand (mix 79\u2013149). To balance service vs holding cost with substantial pipeline, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the most recent demand regime and volatility while avoiding overweighting old extremes. This reduces over-ordering if demand has softened while keeping safety for observed variability and long lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (many orders with lead_time=3 across periods 4,7,8,12,14,16,17,23, etc.), so actual lead time > promised and average should be used. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average. Recent demand since Period_29 dropped from the earlier high-regime; the most recent 10 demand samples (Periods 32\u201341) reflect the current lower regime (~100\u2013150 units). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 so the OR engine targets inventory to current demand volatility while the larger in-transit stock (910) will be reconciled by the engine given the inferred lead time. This balances service level (use observed longer lead time) against holding cost by using recent demand estimates.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,7,12,14,16,17,23,29, etc.) consistently show actual lead time = 3 for multiple arrivals; treat lead time as 3. Recent demand (Periods 29\u201342) averages around ~122 units/period (post the earlier high-demand regime at Periods16\u201326), so I forecast using the most recent stable window to avoid bias from the prior spike. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 14 demand periods (Periods 29\u201342) so (1+L) scaling captures the review+lead horizon while using a recent, stable demand sample to balance service level vs holding cost given high in-transit stock (910 units) and $1 holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. History shows a sustained lead-time change: multiple confirmed arrivals with lead_time=3 (consistent since Period_19). Demand regime shifted up around Period_16 and has remained elevated. On-hand=0 but in-transit=910 (large pipeline including overdue shipments) \u2014 risk of lost/delayed orders; using L=3 captures the observed actual lead time to avoid under-ordering. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), which balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclues show consistent lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed arrivals), so actual lead time > promised 2. Pipeline is large (910) and likely contains several outstanding 3-period shipments; treat L=3 to align forecasts with realized arrivals. Demand regime since Period_16 is elevated (~239 avg) vs early baseline; to capture the recent high-demand regime use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to bias replenishment upward while letting OR cap limit order size. Chosen: L explicit=3 to match observed lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demands (captures elevated regime); sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service needs from sustained higher demand against holding cost and uses OR's cap to avoid oversized single-period orders given large in-transit.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical concludes show a persistent 3-period actual lead time across many arrivals (multiple P->P+3 confirmations), so use explicit L=3 to reflect reality. Demand since Period 29 has settled to a lower regime (recent 17 periods, Period_29\u2013Period_45) with mean \u2248123 units; use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility likewise should reflect recent variability, so set sigma_hat recent_N (N=17). These choices align order coverage to the observed 3-period lead time and recent demand, reducing stockouts from underestimated lead time while avoiding excess holding from using older high-demand regime data.

Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=910. Historical conclude messages show a sustained lead-time=3 pattern (multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (avg up ~+107%). To capture the confirmed longer lead time and higher recent demand, I set L explicit=3. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=11 to reflect the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 11 periods to estimate (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This increases target base-stock to cover the longer lead time and higher demand while the large in-transit position is accounted for by the OR engine.

On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline). Given confirmed LT=3, I set L explicit=3 to align review+lead forecasting and avoid underordering due to prior promised-L=2 mismatch. Demand forecast uses recent_N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean over recent 20 periods). Volatility uses recent_N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock suited for the higher demand and true LT while capping orders to limit holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Period 49: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 for many arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17); promised 2 appears incorrect. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine plans for the correct pipeline coverage. Demand forecasting uses recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16+), giving mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the upshift and recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than diluting with older low-demand samples.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (carry-over insight records +107% increase). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 (large pipeline; some earlier shipments were delayed but many subsequently arrived with observed lead_times mostly =3). I set L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflects confirmed ~3-period reality versus promised 2). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use recent 20 periods to avoid dilution by early low-demand samples). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) so safety stock matches recent variability. These choices help the OR backend increase target base-stock to meet higher demand while acknowledging the longer effective lead time and recent variance, avoiding understocking despite delayed arrivals.
