If that shipment ultimately arrives, it is a very large quantity relative to single-period demand and carrying it will incur high holding cost (holding cost = $1/unit/period equals the unit profit). e) Ordering logic: Because holding cost equals profit, additional inventory before confirmed need reduces expected reward. We already have 348 units in-transit; placing more now risks tying up capital in inventory that will erode profit via holding charges.
