Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Set L=default to keep promised 2-period lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all five samples (mean=115.4) which balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=176 (Period_1 order) which has not concluded (arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided historical samples. This keeps policy aligned with backend assumptions while accounting for the outstanding in-transit units.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=352 (176+176), recent concluded messages show orders placed P1 and P2 but arrived=0 \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2 because P1 order will arrive during Period_3 (visible in Period_4 conclude). No evidence of lost shipments or demand regime change (historical samples mean ~115.4). Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive by their expected delivery (arrived=0 each conclude), indicating missing/delayed shipments beyond the promised L=2. To be conservative about demand estimation while allowing OR backend to use promised lead time, I keep L=default (promised=2). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent realized demands (Periods 1-3) which show a lower recent mean than longer history; sigma_hat uses default to reflect full-sample volatility scaling. These choices balance service (use recent demand to avoid over-ordering) while acknowledging pipeline uncertainty from missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders from Period 1-3 did not arrive by expected lead time (promised 2 periods); pipeline arrivals are uncertain.

Daily Profit: $58.00, Daily Holding Cost: $132.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=132, in-transit=178. History shows mixed lead-time evidence: one order (P1) arrived with lead_time=3, another (P3) arrived with lead_time=1; earlier promised lead_time=2 and several shipments were delayed (Periods1-3). Because observed lead times are inconsistent, use 'calculate' so the backend computes the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand, no clear sustained regime shift in the 5-sample history (samples: 146,110,112,150,59), so use default forecasts ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) letting the backend apply the base-stock formula; this balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each). Parameters chosen also acknowledge pipeline inventory (178) and on-hand (132) so orders will be sized by the OR engine's capped policy to avoid overstock if delays persist.

Daily Profit: $118.00, Daily Holding Cost: $14.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show moderate volatility with last two demands 58 and 118; on-hand=14, in-transit=314. Historical concludes show mixed lead times: one order (P1) arrived with lead_time=3 and one (P3) arrived with lead_time=1; no sustained lead-time shift. Some shipments were delayed earlier (carry-over noted). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (uses available concluded arrivals) rather than trusting promised 2 or a single recent value. For demand forecast and volatility I use default methods so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample mean while allowing the backend to incorporate the inferred average lead time; it balances service level (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=435; recent concludes show variable arrivals (observed lead_times: 3 for P1\u2192P4, 1 for P3\u2192P4) and several delayed/no arrivals in P5\u2013P6. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability rather than blindly trusting promised). Demand history mean (Periods1\u20135 = 115.4) is still the best baseline; use mu_hat='default' so backend sets (1+L)\xd7mean over all samples. Variability estimate left to backend via sigma_hat='default' (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals and current pipeline. This combination is conservative: it recognizes lead-time evidence while using full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Daily Profit: $2.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent concluded history shows inconsistent but elevated lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3 \u2192 avg 2.333). On-hand=0, in-transit=445 (large pipeline but many past orders were delayed/lost earlier). To account for observed lead-time drift vs. promised=2, I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Demand history (samples: 146,110,112,150,59) is limited and no clear sustained demand regime shift is detected, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) allowing the OR engine to scale demand across the review+lead period using the inferred lead time. This balances service (increasing coverage for slightly longer observed lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Daily Profit: $122.00, Daily Holding Cost: $26.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent concludes show variable but frequently 3-period actual lead times (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 avg 2.2). On-hand=26, in-transit=297 (large pipeline arriving in coming periods). To account for realized longer lead time I set L=calculate so backend will use observed-average lead time. Demand history mean=115.4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leaning on full-sample stability while allowing L adjustment to raise safety stock given delayed shipments. This balances service (higher base stock with larger L) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: Period 4: P1\u2192arrived P4 (3 periods); Period 7: P4\u2192arrived P7 (3 periods); Period 8: P5\u2192arrived P8 (3 periods))

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=0, in-transit=419. Historical demand (P1\u2013P9) shows recent mean ~110.6 (P5\u2013P9). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained). Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries and avoid under-ordering. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 5\u20139) where demand stabilized ~110\u2013122; this yields (1+L)-scaled demand and volatility that the OR engine will use to compute base stock while accounting for the longer lead time and current pipeline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=443. Historical demand samples avg=115.4/unit; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier). Many earlier orders arrived late or were delayed; in-transit is large so expect arrivals but they conclude with delay. Set L explicit=3 to match observed actual lead time so the OR backend plans across the correct pipeline length. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

I set L explicitly to 3 to match confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend forecasts over the correct review+lead horizon. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples, balancing service against holding cost given the large in-transit position and equal profit/holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=73, in-transit=297. History shows consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12 observations). Pipeline is sizable but arrivals lag as lead_time=3, so plan for L=3. Demand has recently averaged ~100 units (last 5 observed demands: 122,111,93,102,73) \u2014 use recent demand to reflect current regime. I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to cover the longer confirmed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent demand regime over 5 periods; (1+L)=4 will be applied by backend) so orders cover review+lead horizon and account for recent mean/volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. No evidence of a new sustained change beyond confirmed LT=3.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=18, in-transit=328. Historical concludes show most arrivals follow a 3-period actual lead time (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12 observations). Pipeline is large but arrival timing aligns with LT=3; recent demand (Periods 9\u201313) is lower than early-sample mean. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For mu_hat/sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (Periods 9\u201313) so the OR engine targets service with lower forecasted demand and avoids excess holding given high holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=330. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12 evidence) and several prior missing/delayed arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend plans for a 3-period supply lag. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a conservative baseline forecast and variability estimate while respecting the longer confirmed lead time and the current pipeline of 330 units. This balances service level (accounting for longer lead time) against holding cost given current on-hand=0 and sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=417. Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) with a few shorter (1,2) leads; overall observed lead times average ~2.5 but dominant pattern is 3. To be responsive to the confirmed longer lead pattern I set L method to calculate (backend will use average observed lead time). Demand history samples are limited; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=386. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192arrive pairs). Recent demand shows a sharp spike at Period_16 (305) so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Set lead time explicitly to 3 based on confirmed observations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility (includes the Period_16 spike). This raises (1+L)-period demand forecast to better cover near-term demand and avoids stockouts given long/confirmed lead time while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent demand has spiked (Periods 16-17: 305, 322) so I estimate demand using the most recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=485 (covers several future periods but arrival timing uncertain); confirmed lead time from history is 3 periods, so I set L explicitly to 3. I forecast mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the post-change regime: Periods 13-17 demands = 55,98,77,305,322) to reflect the higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the sustained high-demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand shows a clear high-demand regime (Periods 16-18: 305, 322, 219). On-hand=0, in-transit=686 so pipeline is large but past history confirms actual lead time = 3. To capture the new high-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 3-period spike; this biases orders up to avoid stockouts given long lead time while the large pipeline mitigates short-term overstock risk.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence in prior history). Recent demand (Periods 16-19 = 305,322,219,194) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier baseline. To protect service with the confirmed longer lead time and higher recent demand, set L explicitly to 3 and base demand forecast on the most recent 4 periods (captures the new regime). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base stock for (1+L) periods under the new high-demand regime while accounting for higher variability and the observed delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to 260 over Periods 16-19 vs prior baseline ~115 (\u2248+125%), sustained for 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (Periods 16-20 average demand = 255 units). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192arrived observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 \u2014 pipeline already roughly covers a 4-period demand forecast. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand across review+lead period I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 16-20) so mu_hat reflects the sustained high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of recent samples = 4\xd7255\u22481020). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters align base-stock to the new higher demand while letting the OR engine account for pipeline; using recent samples avoids diluting the new regime with older low-demand data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: recent demand regime is much higher (Period_16-19 avg ~260 vs prior ~115). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 (large pipeline) \u2014 many past orders took 3 periods to arrive so promised LT=2 is unreliable. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time (avoids underordering). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods16-19); sigma_hat also recent_N N=4 to reflect the elevated volatility in the new regime. These choices raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while sigma based on recent volatility keeps safety stock appropriate given holding cost parity with profit.

Demand regime shifted up beginning Period 16 (sustained high demand through Period 22). To reflect confirmed LT and recent high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 periods (Periods 16\u201322) covering the new regime. This balances higher service need against holding cost given large pipeline.

Demand regime shifted up starting Period_16 and has persisted through Period_23 (higher mean \u2248260). I set L to recent_N to reflect the confirmed longer lead time (use recent lead-time observations). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201323, N=8) so the OR base-stock covers (1+L) review+lead demand at the new higher mean and captures recent variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time and high demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent high-demand samples rather than the full historical low-demand series.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained elevated demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show frequent lead_time=3 observations. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures the persistent 3-period pattern). For demand, use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 16\u201326 constitute an 11-period high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat for the sustained high-demand regime) while acknowledging substantial in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period_16 (avg ~260) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 3 periods. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1059 (large pipeline arriving in future periods). To reflect confirmed longer lead time and the post-Period_16 demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (periods 16\u201327, 12 samples) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=12; match sigma_hat to recent volatility with recent_N N=12. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base-stock sized for the longer lead time and the new higher mean while using recent variance to balance service vs holding given large pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) with occasional shorter arrivals; use backend-calculated average lead time to capture observed 3-period mode. Demand shifted up at Period_16 and has remained elevated through Period_28; use a recent-window forecast to capture the new regime. Therefore set L=calculate so backend uses observed lead times, mu_hat=recent_N with N=13 to cover Periods 16\u201328 demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap orders using its cap formula and the inferred lead time, and they account for the large in-transit pipeline when computing order quantity.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (avg \u2248260 over P16\u2013P29) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time \u22483. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1059 \u2014 with L=3 the pipeline (in-transit) covers about 4 review+lead periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time confirmations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 16\u201329) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=14 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts under the confirmed higher-demand, longer-lead-time environment while relying on the large pipeline to limit excessive new ordering.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical concluded lead-times repeatedly show 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.), so use calculated average lead time. Demand shifted up at Period_16 and the recent regime spans Periods 16\u201330 (15 samples); use recent_N=15 to capture the current higher mean and volatility. This sets mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 15 demands and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 15 demands, giving the OR engine a forecast aligned with the sustained higher-demand regime while the calculated L reflects observed slower deliveries, reducing stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32. Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 and has remained elevated through Period_31 (sustained higher mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine plans across the correct pipeline horizon. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 16\u201331) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; same N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the base-stock targets service for the higher-demand regime while accounting for the long lead time and the substantial in-transit stock to avoid excessive additional orders.

Demand spiked around Periods 16-19 but has averaged ~176 over Periods 20-32. To reflect confirmed LT=3 and recent post-spike demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on Periods 20-32 (most relevant regime) so the OR engine sizes base stock to recent realized demand while accounting for the longer lead time and current large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. Recent demand (most recent 5 periods) shows a return to ~baseline levels vs earlier spike, so I use a 3-period lead time explicitly and base demand forecast/volatility on the last 5 samples to capture current regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and the large pipeline inventory to avoid excessive new ordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (documented earlier) and multiple confirmed lead-time observations of 3 periods (several concluded orders arrived with W=3). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=1059 \u2014 significant pipeline but uncertain timing given past delayed shipments. I select L=calculate so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures the confirmed ~3-period reality). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, providing a stable forecast that reflects the long-run data while the calculated L inflates the review+lead horizon to cover the longer lead-time risk. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given lead-time slips) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the appropriate safety stock via the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Demand regime shifted up starting Period_16 (sustained higher mean through recent periods). I set L="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint/high-demand regime (Periods 16-35) so (1+L)*mean reflects elevated demand and protects service level given large in-transit. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage with the sustained higher demand and longer observed lead time, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost parity with profit.

Demand regime shift at Period_16 produced sustained higher demand through recent periods. To reflect confirmed LT and recent high-demand regime, set L explicit=3. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent post-change data while capping N), so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 20 demands). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage to the true 3-period lead time and bias orders toward the higher recent demand while keeping hold cost in mind by using a recent-sample estimate rather than all-time average.

No new sustained demand regime changes since previously recorded shift at Period_16. To let the OR engine adjust lead-time bias I request lead-time be estimated from observed data (calculate). Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period_40: confirmed actual lead time = 3 (historical concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrival timing uncertain until conclude messages. Demand regime shifted up from Period_16 onward; recent periods show elevated demand. Set L explicit=3 to match observed lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to base forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures (1+L) review+lead demand). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the backend base-stock with the sustained higher demand while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and current pipeline position.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical concluces show consistent actual lead time=3 (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, etc.), and large high-demand episode around Periods 16-25 but recent periods (26-40) average ~121 units. To ensure pipeline covers (1+L) periods and avoid stockouts given observed LT=3, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent 15 demand observations (Periods 26-40 mean \u2248121) so the OR backend computes base_stock appropriate for current demand while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and the large in-transit quantity.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_16 (documented earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 (large pipeline but some past shipments were delayed). Lead-time history shows systematic 3-period arrivals; use backend's calculated average lead time to capture observed reality. For demand forecasting, focus on the post-changepoint regime (use recent window) to reflect elevated mean demand; choose recent_N with N=20 (capped) to capture most recent 20-period demand behavior. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (capture higher demand) while letting OR cap orders using its cap formula to limit excessive inventory given holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence earlier). Demand after Period_20 returned to a lower regime (~110-150) so I base demand forecast on the most recent samples. L set explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering given many delayed/lost shipments earlier. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current post-shift demand regime (uses last 20 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (given long lead) against holding cost using empirically recent demand statistics while the OR backend computes the base-stock and caps orders.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence earlier). Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 115,110,99,143,94) averages ~112.2. To account for confirmed longer lead time and recent demand regime normalization, set L to recent_N using the last 3 observed lead times (reflects persistent 3-period observations). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent stable demand window. These choices increase pipeline coverage for the longer lead time while keeping forecasts responsive to recent demand, balancing service level versus holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime earlier and multiple concluded arrivals confirming actual lead time = 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers several (1+L) periods of demand; some past shipments were delayed/lost but later concludes (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) establish L=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost using the longer confirmed lead time while accounting for observed demand samples. This keeps orders conservative given long lead time and large in-transit inventory.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent history shows no new demand regime change; demand from Period_26\u201345 averages near baseline (~110\u2013130). Concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (evidence: P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1059 \u2014 with L=3 the pipeline covers multiple future periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent stable regime (Periods 26\u201345). Same recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align the OR backend base-stock to meet service while avoiding excess hold given holding=profit.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: recent demand (~100-150) after the earlier spike; on-hand=0, in-transit=1059 (large pipeline). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and multiple late arrivals; use explicit L=3 to match reality. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (last ~20 periods) so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand with current variability while avoiding overreaction to older data. Large in-transit means orders will be balanced by the OR cap; explicit L and recent statistics help reduce stockouts given observed 3-period arrivals.

No new sustained demand regime since Period 20 spike. To reflect current demand pattern I set lead time explicitly to 3 and use recent demand (last 8 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the most recent demand level while capping orders given the large in-transit.

Recent demand (Periods 44-48 = 118,130,106,151,126) averages ~126. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time so backend orders cover the correct pipeline horizon. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current post-shift steady demand (~125) and recent volatility rather than early-period low values; this avoids under/over-stocking given large in-transit volume and equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period_50. On-hand=0, in-transit=1059. Historical concluded messages show consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed previously). Recent demand (Periods 30-49) has returned to a roughly stable mid-100s regime (no new sustained shift). To reflect confirmed LT=3 and to focus forecasting on the most recent stable demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3, use a recent_N demand forecast (last 20 periods) for mu_hat to capture current demand level, and use recent_N for sigma_hat over the same window to capture recent volatility. This balances service (accounting for longer LT and large pipeline) against holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand rather than older high-demand spikes.
