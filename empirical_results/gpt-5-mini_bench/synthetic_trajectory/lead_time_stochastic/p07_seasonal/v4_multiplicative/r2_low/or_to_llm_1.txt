Period 3 order arrived with lead time 1; Period 2 order (186) is still in-transit. This shows variable / occasionally delayed lead times; however we have only one long-delay observation so cannot declare a sustained new lead-time regime.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Historical demands (Periods 1-5) average \u03bc\u0304=131 units/period, sample \u03c3\u0304\u224836.4.

OR recommended 54 (its cap/rounding), which matches the shortfall. Given profit=holding, OR's critical fractile=0.5 implies neutral risk posture. With variable lead times (one confirmed delay) there is a real risk that some in-transit units arrive later than promised, but on-hand inventory (155) provides immediate cover while in-transit likely covers much of the 3-period demand.\n\nFinal strategy: Accept OR's recommendation (54 units). This fills the pipeline shortfall to target base-stock for the 3-period demand window while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs and uncertain lead-time behavior. Rationale: OR's base-stock math already targets expected 3-period demand; we lack sufficient evidence (3+ periods) to increase safety stock beyond OR's capped amount, and holding cost equals profit so overstocking has no upside.\n",

The P2 order (186) has not concluded by Period5 conclude despite promised L=2, so that specific P2 shipment appears lost. Inventory and pipeline: on-hand=5, system reports in-transit=240 which matches outstanding orders 186 (P2) + 54 (P5). Given likely loss of the 186 from P2, effective expected future arrival may be only 54 unless P2 later concludes (lost orders never conclude; prolonged absence signals loss).

To avoid excessive holding risk if P2 unexpectedly arrives or lead time shortens, I follow the OR capped baseline recommendation (156 units), which already balances demand coverage and the OR cap.
