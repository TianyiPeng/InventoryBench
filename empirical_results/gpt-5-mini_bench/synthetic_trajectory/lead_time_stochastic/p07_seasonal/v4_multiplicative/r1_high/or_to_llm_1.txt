This indicates actual lead time may be longer than promised 2, so plan for L_actual = 3 when sizing coverage (but not yet recording as carry-over since only one confirmed observation). Demand & OR baseline: OR used historical samples (mean 131, std ~36.4) and promised L=2 to recommend 169. Recomputing with OR method but using actual L=3: single-period mean \u03bc\u0304=131; (1+L) total mean \u03bc\u0302=4\xd7131=524; variance scaling gives \u03c3\u0302\u224872.8.

To reach base-stock for L=3: order_raw = 644 \u2212 258 \u2248 386 units. Rationale for overriding OR cap: OR's cap limits ordering under the promised L=2 assumption; given observed longer lead time (order placed P1 only arrived P4) we face a large shortfall versus the 4-period demand (\u2248524 units). Profit per unit ($19) is high relative to holding cost ($1), so the cost of understock (lost profit) outweighs holding cost; I prefer to build pipeline to the higher base-stock rather than accept stockout risk. Final decision: order 386 units to bring pipeline+on-hand closer to the base-stock appropriate for L=3 and cover 4 periods of expected demand.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 524 units. Demand outlook: recent observed period demands when stocked typically ~100\u2013140 units; using a conservative single-period mean \u2248100 units implies (L+1)=4 periods of demand \u2248400 units. Decision vs OR: OR recommends 0 (uses promised L and full history). Given confirmed L=3 and in-transit=524 > required \u2248400, no additional order is needed now \u2014 placing zero avoids unnecessary holding cost.
