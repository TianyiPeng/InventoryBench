{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Carry-over shows actual lead time confirmed = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime drop (Periods15\u201319 avg \u224876.4). Recent demand (Periods45\u201349) averages \u224882. Ordering now (lead time=3) will not affect current-period sales and will arrive after multiple demand periods; with (L+1)=4, expected demand coverage needed \u22484\xd780\u2248320 units. Pipeline (307) nearly covers that and placing an order risks high holding cost ($1/unit) while marginal profit is $4. OR recommended 61 but that would increase ending inventory and holding cost with limited sales upside given the lower demand regime and long/variable lead times. Therefore I order 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs and rely on in-transit stock; monitor for concluded arrivals to update lead-time/pipeline belief before ordering next period.",
