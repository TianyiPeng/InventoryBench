If those in-transit units never arrive, we will face stockouts; if they do arrive, additional ordering creates excess holding cost. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the cost of under-ordering is worse than modest extra holding.

Risks: Some past delayed/lost shipments occurred, but there is no current concluded evidence of additional losses affecting the large in-transit volume. Ordering decision: Do not place a new order to avoid unnecessary holding cost; let in-transit inventory arrive and satisfy demand while we monitor for any missing arrivals in future conclude messages.
