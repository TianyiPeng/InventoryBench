Rationale: in-transit 326 already essentially equals the 3-period expected demand \u03bc\u0302\u2248326.4, so additional ordering now provides little marginal stockout protection but increases holding cost. There is insufficient evidence of a lead-time failure or lost shipment (only one conclude with arrived=0), so do not pre-emptively top-up. Monitor for arrivals in future conclude messages; if the 326 fails to arrive by its promised arrival window, escalate orders then.

No concluded arrivals yet, so do not infer lost shipments or different lead time. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=326. Recent realized demands (Period1=115, Period2=109) average \u2248112 units/period; (L+1)=3 period coverage \u2248336 units. The current pipeline (326) is slightly below the 3-period demand by \u224810 units, but that shortfall is small relative to uncertainty and any order placed now would arrive after the next 2 periods (too late to affect immediate periods). OR recommends 87 based on promised lead time and historical samples; following OR would push pipeline much higher and create substantial holding cost (Holding=$1/unit/period) while orders placed now won't help near-term fill. Final strategy: place 0 units now to avoid unnecessary holding cost and wait one more period to observe whether the Period 1 order actually arrives in the Period 3 arrival resolution (we'll see it in Period 4 conclude).
