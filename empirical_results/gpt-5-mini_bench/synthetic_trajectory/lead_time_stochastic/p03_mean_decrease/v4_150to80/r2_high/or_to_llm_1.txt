Timing: An order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive in time to affect sales until after several periods (given observed L=3), so it cannot increase units_sold in the remaining horizon. Economics: profit per unit ($19) is large versus holding cost ($1), so ordering only makes sense if arrival will be used; ordering now risks creating ending inventory that incurs holding cost without increasing sales this period.

  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history shows actual lead time often = 3 and earlier lost-shipment patterns (Periods 1\u20134 flagged). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=714; OR recommends 0. Demand history (Periods 1\u201349) average ~120\u2013140 with intermittent spikes, but many recent periods had zero arrivals/sales when on-hand=0, so pipeline reliability is uncertain. Risk tradeoff: profit per unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1), so stocking is attractive only if pipeline will actually arrive; however multiple long gaps with in-transit but no arrivals imply recent shipments may still be in-transit or lost. The OR baseline uses promised L and historical demand and recommends 0; given existing large in-transit quantity (714) that may fill future demand if it arrives, placing additional orders now risks higher holding cost if those in-transit units arrive. Therefore follow OR and order 0 to avoid over-ordering against uncertain pipeline while we wait for concludes that confirm arrivals or losses. Monitor next concludes to update lead-time/loss inference and revise ordering.",
