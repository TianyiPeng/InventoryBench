Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [216,129,138,129,115] (mean ~145.4). Promised lead time is 2 and no concluded arrivals exist to suggest a different lead time or lost shipments. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects full historical demand given no evidence of a regime shift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_2. On-hand 0, in-transit 212 (ordered in P1, not yet concluded). Promised lead time = 2 and no concluded arrivals contradicting it, so keep L as default (promised). Historical demand samples: [216,129,138,129,115], mean=145.4. I choose mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean using all samples, and sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock grounded in full-history demand while accounting for promised lead time; if the in-transit 212 proves insufficient versus (1+L)\xd7mean, backend ordering will top up subject to its cap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. History: two recent orders (P1=212, P2=204) are in-transit but not yet concluded; this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (we have no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time). Demand history (samples: 216,129,138,129,115) shows mean ~145.4. I use default lead time (promised) because no concluded arrivals contradict it. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change. Note: on-hand 0 + in-transit 416 is slightly below (1+L)\xd7mean (~436), so the backend may order to top up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (sum of orders P1-P3). Historical demand samples available; recent concluded periods show no arrivals for orders placed P1-P3 (expected with promised L=2). To be conservative against continued delays, set lead time explicitly longer so the OR backend builds larger pipeline cover. Chosen L: explicit 3 to cover potential delay. mu_hat and sigma_hat: use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a straightforward increase in target base-stock and safety stock given longer L. This balances service level (protects against missing/delayed shipments) versus holding cost by relying on data-driven scaling rather than aggressive manual overforecasting.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed Period_1 (212), Period_2 (204), Period_3 (93) have not arrived by their expected promised lead time=2 (3 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0 for those orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent concluded data shows arrivals from Period_1 (lead_time=3) and Period_3 (lead_time=1). On-hand=142, in-transit=350. Promised L=2 but observed lead times are variable; using observed average to let OR backend blend actual performance. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses average observed lead times (captures recent 3 and 1 observations). Demand history samples (216,129,138,129,115) are limited and no sustained demand regime change is evident, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to let OR compute base-stock and cap consistent with its statistical assumptions. This balances service level (by reflecting observed lead-time variability) against holding cost while acknowledging missing/delayed shipments in the pipeline.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Concluded history shows mixed actual lead times (observed W=3 for P1->P4, W=1 for P3->P4); average observed lead time = 2. Given variable but limited evidence, use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile promised vs observed. Use default demand and volatility methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all respectively; this balances service level vs holding cost while backend applies its capped ordering logic. This choice recognizes overdue arrivals in past periods but avoids over-reacting to heterogeneous lead-time samples.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=655. History shows inconsistent lead times (observed arrivals: P1\u2192arrived in P4, lead_time=3; P3\u2192arrived in P4, lead_time=1) and several missed/ delayed arrivals earlier, so use observed lead-time average rather than promised. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability between 1\u20133). For demand I use default (backend (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because the 5-sample history is limited; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time. This also keeps orders sized to cover review+lead period while letting backend cap prevent over-ordering against potential lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show moderate, stable demand with last observed demands: 216,129,138,129,115 (mean\u2248145). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 \u2014 large pipeline but several past delayed arrivals indicate variable lead times (observed lead_times: 3,1,3). I choose to let backend compute an empirical lead time average (calculate) so L reflects observed variability. For demand and volatility I use default aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all respectively; this balances service vs holding given high pipeline and uncertain lead times while keeping parameters simple and robust to the mixed lead-time signals.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=41, in-transit=485. Historical demand samples (216,129,138,129,115) mean=145.4. Concluded arrivals show actual lead times observed = {P1->P4:3, P3->P4:1, P4->P7:3, P5->P8:3} (multiple 3-period observations). Several early shipments were delayed beyond promised L=2, but recent pattern is predominantly 3. I set L using 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the 3-period pattern). For demand forecast I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples (keeps full-sample stability given limited data). Volatility set to 'default' so backend uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices let the OR engine raise target pipeline to cover the longer realized lead time while retaining demand stability from all samples to avoid overreacting to small-sample noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4=3, P4->P7=3, P5->P8=3; 3 independent arrivals supporting L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: recent conclude history shows lead time consistently 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). On-hand=43, in-transit=459; pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed historically. To protect service with confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3. For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to leverage full sample set given no recent sustained demand regime shift. Sigma uses default to reflect observed variability scaled for L. These settings bias orders toward covering the longer confirmed lead time while letting the OR backend compute safety stock tradeoff between $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11. Recent demand has risen vs earlier periods (last 5 demands P6-P10 = 143,160,125,140,170; mean \u2248147.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=595 (multiple past delayed arrivals; lead time has been observed at 3). To protect service given confirmed L=3 and recent higher demand, I use a 4-period (1+L) recent demand estimate (recent_N=5) so the base-stock reflects current regime while sigma uses same recent window to capture near-term volatility. This addresses overdue shipments by explicitly using L=3 and sizing mu_hat over the most recent regime to avoid understocking.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=621. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time=3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 arrivals). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. Demand has run-rate ~135\u2013170 recently; to capture the current regime I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 11 observed demands from Period_1\u2013Period_11). This makes mu_hat cover (1+L)=4 periods of the latest demand pattern and sigma_hat reflect recent volatility, aligning the base-stock target to observed demand while acknowledging elevated pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: recent concludes show multiple independent arrivals consistent with an actual lead time \u22483 (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12). On-hand=170, in-transit=384 \u2014 ample pipeline but past periods had delayed/missing shipments earlier, so infer lead time from observed arrivals rather than promised. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed L\u22483). Demand history is limited but stable around mean\u2248145; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while respecting inferred longer lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals in history). Recent demand has moderated but variable; last 5 concluded demands = [140,170,142,82,147], mean=136.2. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering given in-transit backlog. I set mu_hat based on recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L=4 periods) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent realized arrivals strongly indicate actual lead time > promised (multiple 3-period observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed historically. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the recent 3-period mode). For demand I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine combine our inferred lead time with historical demand uncertainty. This balances service (use longer inferred L) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and observed arrival delays.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) so actual lead time = 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. Recent demand has moderated vs early spike; I use recent_N (N=5, periods 11\u201315 demands = 142,82,147,159,167) to capture the current regime for both mean and volatility. mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 to compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands so ordering matches the short-term demand level; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This combination keeps service high given confirmed longer lead time while avoiding excessive holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. On-hand=0, in-transit=586. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this gives the OR engine a full (L+1)-period demand forecast to balance service level (profit-driven) versus holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18. On-hand=164, in-transit=415. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead times clustering at 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) though some 1-2 period arrivals exist; evidence supports using observed average lead time rather than promised. I choose L='calculate' so backend computes the average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all provided demand samples (keeps estimate anchored to full-sample mean). For volatility I use 'default' so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These choices let the OR engine adjust safety stock for the empirically observed lead time while keeping demand forecast grounded in full-sample stats given no new sustained demand regime change.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Recent conclude history shows consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) and many earlier promised-2 shipments were delayed/lost; on-hand=94, in-transit=415. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, ensuring the base-stock accounts for the longer 4-period pipeline while leveraging historical demand variability; this balances service level (reduce stockouts given L=3) against holding costs.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). On-hand=41, in-transit=516 \u2014 pipeline is large vs. recent demand. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 5 demand periods (Periods 15-19) to capture the current lower-demand regime; backend will scale mu_hat by (1+L). This keeps orders aligned with recent demand while avoiding excess holding given the large in-transit volume.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent realized demand ~140\u2013170 with historical sample mean ~145. On-hand=0, in-transit=516 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely already covers multiple periods but past shipments showed systematic 3-period actual lead time and some earlier lost delays. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual LT=3 (prevents under-ordering). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historic mean and volatility (anchoring forecasts to full sample while letting backend apply service-level formula). This balances service (use confirmed longer LT) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=594. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=3 (multiple independent P->P+3 confirmations). Pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed relative to promised L=2, so use L=3 explicitly. Demand recent regime (Periods 17-21) is lower (~49-89); I use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current lower mean/volatility. Methods chosen: L explicit=3 to match observed confirmations; mu_hat recent_N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on last 5 periods; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (longer true lead time) vs holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=594. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals with some 1-2 period noise; average observed lead time is above promised 2, so use calculated average lead time. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let backend scale forecasts by the inferred L while keeping parameters robust to observed variance. This balances service (higher L -> larger mu_hat) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=10, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 observations), so I set L explicitly=3 to reflect actual arrival cadence. Recent demand has been lower than early samples; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the latest regime (last 5 periods avg demand ~70). This keeps base-stock tuned to current demand while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and large in-transit pipeline.

Demand recent window shows elevated/variable demand (last 5 demands: P20-24 = 89,76,64,68,102) so compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples to capture current regime and volatility.

Given confirmed L=3 and recent uptick, set L explicitly to 3 to force OR to plan for longer pipeline. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5), which balances service level during the demand rise while avoiding excessive hold given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent demand has been moderate but variable (last 5 demands: 64,68,102,123,72; mean=85.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). To ensure pipeline covers review+lead (1+L=4) periods and respond to the confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (4-period aggregation in backend). This keeps target base-stock responsive to current demand while accounting for higher effective pipeline caused by L=3 and the large in-transit volume.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 68,102,123,72,59) averages ~84.8 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=516 \u2014 pipeline currently exceeds required cover for a 4-period review+lead horizon. Historical conclude messages have previously confirmed sustained lead_time=3; several earlier shipments arrived with W=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and to avoid the backend assuming the promised L=2. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (last five periods show lower/stable demand than earlier bursts); mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean of those 5 periods so the backend will size base-stock to four-period demand based on recent average. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. Given in-transit=516 > (1+L)*recent_mean (~339), no aggressive ordering is required this period; these parameters prioritize service while avoiding extra holding cost from ordering into the large pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals), so set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand has moderated after earlier highs; last 5 demand samples (Periods 24-28 = 102,123,72,59,104) give a recent mean \u224892. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on current regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets safety stock for L+1=4 periods of current demand while avoiding overordering from older high-demand samples; explicit L addresses the observed lead-time shift and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained lead-time of 3 periods (multiple independent arrivals P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 and later patterns). I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized supplier behavior and avoid under/over-ordering from wrong lead-time. Demand has recently been lower than early-period peaks (last 5 demands: Period_25-29 = 123,72,59,104,93) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock with observed lead-time and the most recent demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

To ensure pipeline covers longer realised lead time I set L explicit=3.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32: recent concluded history firmly supports actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=516 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed relative to promised L=2. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the longer realized transit, I set L explicit=3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from historical demand samples; this scales the forecast and safety stock to the longer review+lead period and balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff. This choice mitigates stockouts given observed 3-period lead times while avoiding excess holding by relying on the backend's capped ordering policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend aligns base-stock to the inferred lead time while using full historical demand for stability. Current pipeline (543) provides coverage; defaults balance service vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Given the strong evidence confirming a sustained lead-time shift to 3 periods, I set L explicitly to 3 to align the OR engine's review+lead forecasting window with observed arrivals. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while leveraging the full historical demand sample set and the corrected lead-time assumption. This handles overdue/in-transit inventory by sizing orders for a 3-period lead-time horizon.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 arrivals). To protect against repeated delayed arrivals I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has been lower recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the latest regime (periods 30-34 demands = 59,144,108,78,66). This raises the review+lead demand horizon to (1+3)=4 periods of the recent mean while keeping variability responsive\u2014balancing higher service level given late shipments against holding cost.

I choose to let the backend infer lead time from observed concludes (calculate) and use default demand sizing (default mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine uses full sample history scaled by (1+L). This balances service level given uncertain lead times while avoiding manual overreaction to transient lead-time observations or short demand blips.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41. On-hand=0, in-transit=516, recent demand history shows intermittent demand with many stockouts; prior concluded messages confirm actual lead time=3 periods. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 motivate moderate service level. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time (prevents underordering given delayed arrivals). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine produce a base-stock that balances profit vs holding given the confirmed longer lead time and current pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: recent demand has been low/moderate (last 5 demands avg ~86.8) vs earlier higher episodes; on-hand=0, in-transit=516 (many pending arrivals). Historical concluded lead times show a persistent shift above 2 in places (multiple 3s) so use observed-average lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to adapt to the current lower demand regime and reduce overstock risk given large in-transit pipeline. This balances service (by using calculated average lead time) against holding costs (by forecasting using recent demand and lower volatility).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43. Recent history shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead-time arrivals (Period_1->4, P4->7, P5->8 etc.); current on-hand=0, in-transit=516. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised 2. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples so the base-stock covers the review+lead horizon (4 periods) given the confirmed L=3. This balances service level (capture demand across 4 periods) versus holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. History shows multiple independent arrivals confirming actual lead time = 3 (consistent P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=516 so pipeline is large but arrivals will be delayed by 3 periods. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while letting OR engine calculate safety stock given the corrected lead time. This balances service level (accounting for longer delivery delay) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) so I set lead time to 3. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute demand across the review+lead period ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) based on all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and current large pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical conclude messages (multiple P->P+3 arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 and later confirmations) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and show past missing/delayed shipments. To ensure OR backend accounts for the longer pipeline, I set L explicit=3. Demand estimate and volatility will use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving full-sample demand signal while the explicit L protects against under-ordering from observed longer lead times.

LLM Rationale:

Given confirmed L=3 and no strong recent demand regime shift (recent demands vary but align with historical samples), use explicit L=3 so pipeline coverage matches observed delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine size base stock and cap appropriately to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering the longer lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent history shows low and variable demand with long-running in-transit pipeline (on-hand=0, in-transit=516). Multiple concluded arrivals established actual lead time \u22483 periods; pipeline likely contains arrivals consistent with L=3. To ensure OR backend accounts for the observed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, keeping forecasting conservative across the full history and letting OR balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical conclude messages (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) confirmed actual lead time = 3. To avoid under-ordering I set L explicitly=3 so the OR engine will size orders for the longer observed lead time. No sustained demand regime shift detected recently, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. In-transit stock (516) should cover several periods; using L=3 aligns pipeline accounting with observed arrivals and reduces risk of stockouts given delayed shipments.

To cover demand over review+lead (L+1) and reflect confirmed longer transit, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (higher safety stock because L=3) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.
