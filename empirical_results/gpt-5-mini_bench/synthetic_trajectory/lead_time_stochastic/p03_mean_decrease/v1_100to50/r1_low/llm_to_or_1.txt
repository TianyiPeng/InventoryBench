Using initial samples from train.csv: /shared/share_malatown/OR-Agent-GPT5mini-benchmark/examples/benchmark/synthetic_trajectory/lead_time_stochastic/p03_mean_decrease/v1_100to50/r1_low/train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 118), ('Period_2', 124), ('Period_3', 116), ('Period_4', 96), ('Period_5', 91)]
  Mean: 109.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (default) since no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments yet. Demand samples (118,124,116,96,91) give mean=109; with L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods so default mu_hat/sigma_hat apply. This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on historical mean and volatility until more data (arrivals/concludes) indicate a regime change.

Demand history (all samples) will be used for forecasting. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=263; two recent orders (P1,P2) have not concluded (arrived=0), so no confirmed lead-time change yet. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting to delayed arrivals. Demand history mean=109 (samples provided), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults which apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std respectively; this balances service level given profit=holding cost and prevents over-ordering while awaiting in-transit stock.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 (133,130,52) have all arrived=0 despite promised L=2 \u2192 sustained missing shipments over 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=315 (likely includes those lost/delayed). I set L explicit=3 to conservatively reflect prolonged/no arrivals. Demand evidence (concluded demands) = [102, 87, 126]; I use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast/volatility on the most recent regime. Using N=3 (regime length=3) captures the recent realized demand and keeps safety stock responsive given higher lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments confirmed: orders placed P1-P3 (133,130,52) all arrived=0 (3 consecutive periods) \u2192 treat actual lead time as >=3 or shipments lost; adjust planning accordingly.

Daily Profit: $88.00, Daily Holding Cost: $97.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: on-hand=97, in-transit=235. History shows delayed arrivals (Period 4 conclude: order from P1 arrived in P4 \u2192 observed lead time = 3 periods) and earlier runs of missing/delayed shipments. To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3 so the backend plans for a longer pipeline (covers L+1 periods). Use default demand sizing and volatility so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand (no clear sustained demand regime change) while the explicit L protects service against late arrivals.

Daily Profit: $97.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=325. History shows mixed lead-time evidence (P1\u2192P4 = 3 periods confirmed; P3\u2192P4 = 1 period); some recent orders (e.g. P5 ordered=90) still unarrived, indicating lead-time variability and possible lost/delayed shipments. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages. Demand appears to have shifted recently; I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 observed demand periods (Periods 3\u20135 = 126, 88, 115) to be responsive to the current regime. These settings balance service (capture recent higher variability) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* will be conservative.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=439. History shows at least one confirmed 3-period lead time (P1 order arrived in P4) and multiple missing/delayed arrivals earlier\u2014promised L=2 is unreliable. To be conservative vs. lost shipments I set lead time explicit=3 so the backend plans for a longer pipeline. Demand history shows no sustained mean shift, so use default demand/volatility estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals show multiple orders taking 3 periods (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7); treat actual lead time as 3. On-hand=29 and in-transit=334 provide pipeline cover but shipments earlier were delayed/lost; set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and use default demand/statistics (all samples) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Profit: $95.00, Daily Holding Cost: $24.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1 arrived P4; P4->P7; P5->P8). On-hand=24, in-transit=290; promised=L=2 is incorrect and shipments have been delayed but now consistent. Set L explicitly to 3 to match observed lead time so the OR engine plans over the correct pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). This avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=337. Historical concludes show multiple 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) and several lost/delayed shipments earlier; a 1-period arrival (P8\u2192P9) is isolated. I treat actual lead time as 3 to be conservative and avoid stockouts. Chosen L=explicit(3) to reflect confirmed 3-period arrivals; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, which balances service vs holding given equal profit/holding costs. This also lets the backend cap orders using its cap formula while accounting for the longer observed lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with multiple 3-period observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) and some 1-periods; overall average lead time > promised. I set L=calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded messages (reflecting confirmed 3-period behavior). Demand forecast and volatility use default (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this is conservative given irregular arrivals and avoids overfitting to short noisy sequences. This balances higher safety stock for longer actual lead time while letting the capped order limit control order size given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 76,95,77,96,78) averages ~84.4. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8 observations) and several earlier missing shipments; therefore use explicit L=3 to reflect realized pipeline delay. Set mu_hat using recent_N over last 5 periods to capture current lower-demand regime (1+L=4 \u2192 forecast = 4 * mean_recent). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep order targets aligned with observed 3-period arrivals and limit overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=66, in-transit=244. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times fluctuating but recent pattern centers above promised 2 (observed sequence includes multiple 3s and occasional 1-2). To be conservative vs. lost/late shipments, set L using a recent average of observed lead times (recent_N=5) so the backend plans for slightly longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so they scale with chosen L and full-sample demand stats (samples mean ~109; using default lets backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (accounting for longer effective lead time) against holding cost by leveraging backend's z*-cap logic while preserving demand information from all samples.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical conclude messages show multiple 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) \u2014 treat actual lead time as 3. Use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (captures baseline demand across review+lead). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). These settings account for delayed arrivals and let OR backend target appropriate base-stock while capping orders per its cap rule.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent demand averaged roughly ~90\u201395/unit (periods 1\u201314 show no sustained spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=394 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8 observations). I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to align planning with observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history (robust given no clear regime change), which balances service level against $1 holding cost and $1 profit by letting the backend target the analytic service quantile.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. On-hand=0, in-transit=394. Historical conclude messages show sustained actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12), and several earlier missing arrivals\u2014so promised L=2 is unreliable. Set lead time explicitly to 3 to align planning with observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=3; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding (q\u22480.5) while letting the OR engine apply its capped order cap. Parameters will ensure pipeline + on-hand target covers (L+1) periods of demand under the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=351. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16) with some 1-2 period noise \u2014 recent behavior supports using a short recent average. To focus on the latest regime I use recent_N for L with N=5 (average of last 5 observed lead times) so the OR engine plans for the empirically observed lead-time. Demand has been near ~94 units recently (Periods 12-16); I set mu_hat to recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent demand regime. Volatility appears stable recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 as well. These choices let the backend compute a base-stock that balances service (using recent demand & lead-time) against holding cost while accounting for overdue/lost shipments evidence.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent realized demand has been volatile but roughly 70\u2013110 per period; on-hand=54, in-transit=244 (substantial pipeline). Past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent arrivals P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). To keep service while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed reality. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (last 5 demand periods) so the base-stock and cap respond to current demand levels and variability. This balances service level (capture pipeline) versus holding cost given significant in-transit inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=24, in-transit=294. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period actual lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirmations). Given sustained confirmed LT=3 and substantial pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans over the correct lead+review horizon. Demand shows no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand estimate and default volatility to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples. This balances service (accounting for LT=3) versus holding cost given current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Historical demand samples show moderate average demand (~109 per period from provided samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=347. Carry-over evidence (Period 9) confirms actual lead time = 3 periods; earlier prolonged missing arrivals also support L>=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine plans across the correct pipeline length. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost while accounting for the longer lead time and current in-transit shortfall.

To ensure pipeline covers demand during review+lead, I set lead time explicitly to 3.

To protect service while accounting for lost/ delayed early arrivals, I set L explicitly to 3. Using default demand estimates lets the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and available historical demand samples.

Given confirmed actual lead time = 3 and current pipeline, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid stale early samples; this targets (1+L)-period demand based on latest observations and captures current volatility for the OR backend to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period_25 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations); use calculated lead time to let backend set L=3. Demand history (samples provided) is limited to early-period five-sample series; with no recent sustained demand regime change, use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples). Volatility also use default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)). This keeps orders aligned with confirmed longer lead time, uses pipeline inventory appropriately, and lets the OR engine trade service level vs holding cost using the profit/holding cost ratio.

Historical concludes show confirmed actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12 patterns) and several lost/delayed shipments earlier, so plan with L=3. Use recent_N=5 for demand estimates to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (Periods21-25 demand = [66,37,20,36,51], mean=42) and reduce sensitivity to older high-demand bursts. With L=3, (1+L)=4 so mu_hat uses the 5-period recent mean scaled over the review+lead period; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. This approach keeps safety stock moderate given confirmed longer lead time while avoiding excess holding cost given current low demand and existing in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and several early lost/delayed shipments; therefore set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest lower-demand regime (last 5 observed demands) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent_mean and volatility over the most recent regime, avoiding overstock from older high-demand periods while respecting longer lead time and current pipeline.

Given missing/delayed shipments earlier and confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so backend computes (1+L)-period demand correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u2014 this raises protection for the longer exposure window while keeping volatility treatment standard. This balances service (profit=holding tradeoff) given confirmed LT shift and current large in-transit volume.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 24-28: 36,51,52,58,48). On-hand=0, in-transit=347 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=3 repeatedly. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 24-28). This keeps target base_stock aligned with current demand while the explicit L handles past lost/delayed shipments and prevents the OR engine (which assumes promised lead time) from underestimating required pipeline coverage. Large existing in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure; using recent_N avoids reacting to earlier high-demand spikes.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals observed). Recent demand (Periods 25\u201329 = 51,52,58,48,55) shows a sustained lower-demand regime vs early periods; to reflect the current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. Setting L explicit=3 aligns ordering with observed arrivals and avoids underordering given lost/ delayed shipments. Recent_N (N=5) captures the most recent stable demand pattern (N=5 chosen per recent regime length and available samples). These parameters bias the OR backend toward service for current demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Use L explicit=3 so the OR engine sizes pipeline for the longer confirmed lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from all samples (conservative aggregate forecast) while the explicit L captures the main operational shift to avoid stockouts given large in-transit volume.

To cover current plus L future demand and reflect confirmed LT=3, I set L explicitly to 3.

Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) and multiple lost/delayed arrivals early \u2014 treat lead time as 3. Demand has trended lower recently; use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so orders match current regime and avoid excess holding given $1 holding/unit. Chosen methods: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)-period demand on last 5 observed demands; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while accounting for the longer lead time and avoiding overstocks from stale historical averages.

LLM Rationale:
Period_34: On-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concludes (Periods 4,7,12,16,17,23 etc.) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. To avoid stockouts given observed 3-period arrivals, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap using full historical demand sample set; this balances service (preventing stockouts under confirmed LT=3) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: recent realized lead times have been 3 (confirmed earlier), on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Many recent periods show lower demand than initial samples; to reflect current regime I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L) periods using the most recent 5 demand observations, which adapts to the sustained lower demand while still covering (1+L) periods given the longer lead time and existing in-transit stock. This balances service (longer actual L) vs holding cost by reducing forecast toward recent demand levels.

Given repeated lost/delayed shipments earlier and the confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which provides (L+1)-period coverage and balances service level vs holding cost under the longer observed lead time.

Pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed relative to decisions (1-period observation lag). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand has been lower/variable; I use recent_N (last 5 periods: Period_32\u201336 demands = 24,63,18,60,34) to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the current lower regime. This keeps the base-stock target appropriately sized given holding cost = profit and avoids excess holding from the large pipeline while maintaining service over the 1+L review+lead horizon.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand since the lead-time confirmation has been lower and relatively stable; to capture the recent regime I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L) demand and variability using the most recent 20 demand observations. This balances service (longer true lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each): longer lead time raises (1+L) forecast while recent_N reduces sensitivity to older high peaks. Current pipeline (347) will be compared to the (1+L)\xd7recent mean by the OR engine to size the order.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent concluded history shows confirmed lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=347 (useful pipeline for L=3). Demand baseline from available samples has mean ~109. To ensure OR backend accounts for observed LT=3 and to cover (1+L) review+lead demand, set L explicit=3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the historical demand samples; this balances service level (capturing confirmed longer LT) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) and earlier missing shipments\u2014treat lead time as 3. Pipeline (347) is sizable but arrivals will be observed only after their conclude; plan using L=3. Demand has settled lower than early periods; I use recent_N=20 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 22\u201341) for both mean and volatility so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat over the recent demand regime. This balances service (using confirmed L=3 and recent demand) versus holding cost by avoiding overreaction to early high samples.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). Demand recent periods (P38\u2013P42) range ~44\u201365. To guard against lost/delayed shipments and match observed lead time, I set L explicitly=3 so the OR backend plans over a 4-period horizon. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L)=4; this balances service (cover multi-period demand during confirmed LT=3) versus holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) and a prior carry-over noting lead time=3; several early shipments were missing then later arrived with 3-period lag so actual lead time is sustained at 3. I set L explicit=3 to match observed actual lead time. Demand has trended lower recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand periods (Periods 39\u201343) so the OR backend sizes base stock conservatively given long lead time and current large in-transit pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45. Demand context: recent realized demands vary ~18\u2013115; historical seed samples (P1\u2013P5) mean ~109. On-hand=0, in-transit=347. Concluded history shows lead time confirmed as 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8 observations). Therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and avoids under-ordering given large pipeline.

I set L explicit=3 so planning covers the observed 3-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples, balancing service (longer coverage) against holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed vs. promised lead time. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the engine produce the base-stock and cap while accounting for the longer effective lead time and balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 (confirmed earlier), and multiple past lost/delayed shipments\u2014plan assuming L=3. Use L explicit=3 so the OR backend plans across the longer pipeline. Use mu_hat method=default and sigma_hat method=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing stable forecasts given long history; this balances service (profit=holding cost so q=0.5) while avoiding overfitting short fluctuations. Current pipeline (347) likely covers several periods of demand, so rely on backend caps to limit new orders.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical conclues show sustained 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals); earlier missing shipments resolved into a 3-period pattern. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time (promised=2 but arrivals consistently at +3). Demand recent regime: last 5 demands (Periods44-48) = 42,42,38,60,64 so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the current demand level/volatility. This yields (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility over the recent regime; with in-transit=347 > forecasted pipeline need this avoids unnecessary replenishment while accounting for the longer lead time and preventing stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, etc.). Given 3+ consecutive confirmations and long stretches of delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect realized behavior. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting it scale forecasts/uncertainty to the confirmed L=3. This balances service level (accounting for longer pipeline) against holding cost using full-sample statistics; current in-transit (347) will be counted as pipeline by the backend when computing orders.
