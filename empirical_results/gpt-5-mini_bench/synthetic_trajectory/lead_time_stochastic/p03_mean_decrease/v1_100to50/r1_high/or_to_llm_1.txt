Step 4 - Cost tradeoff & OR: Profit >> holding cost (19 vs 1) but incremental order now would increase holding cost across multiple periods and is unnecessary given coverage.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=16 + in-transit=484 = 500 units available when arrivals conclude. Recent period demands have been ~40\u201364 (last 6 periods: 42,38,60,64,16\u2192 sold 16 earlier but recent full-sales 42\u201364), so even under conservative demand (take 65 units/period) the pipeline covers multiple periods: 500 units \u2248 >7 periods of demand. OR recommended 0 units; given large pipeline, ordering risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) without increasing sales (demand limited). Action decision: place 0 order.
