Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "State & inference: On-hand=0, In-transit=436. Promised L=2 but past evidence shows variable/occasionally delayed lead times and some lost shipments; however no new sustained lead-time change since last carry-over insight. Demand estimate: use provided historical sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) \u03bc\u0304=109 units/period \u2192 (1+L)*\u03bc\u0302 = 3*109 = 327 units over review+lead. OR recommended 0 because its capped base-stock (using promised L) deems pipeline sufficient. Decision logic: In-transit 436 > required coverage 327, so pipeline likely large enough to cover (L+1) periods even allowing for variability. Ordering now risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) without clear need. Adjustment: follow OR and order 0 units. Inventory risk mitigation: monitor upcoming conclude messages for any non-arrivals (lost shipments) \u2014 if multiple outstanding units fail to conclude in coming periods, escalate ordering in future periods to restore coverage.
