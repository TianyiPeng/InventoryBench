{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=369. OR recommends 0 based on historical demand and promised lead time. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods (carry-over insight). Requirement: orders+on-hand+pipeline should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand because current-period demand occurs after decision and actual L=3. Estimate demand scale from history: recent periods average ~30\u201350 units, earlier samples show higher spikes, but 369 units in-transit already provide substantial coverage (369 / 40 \u2248 9 periods at a conservative 40 units/period). Placing any order now risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) without reducing stockouts. Therefore do not order this period and let in-transit inventory fulfill upcoming demand; monitor arrivals in subsequent conclude messages to confirm no losses and adjust if pipeline shortfalls appear.",
