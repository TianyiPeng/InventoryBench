Using the demand samples (mean=93, sd\u224837.8) and L=2 the OR base-stock target is ~279 units (\u03bc\u0302 = 3\xd793 = 279) with critical fractile q=profit/(profit+holding)=1/(1+1)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0, so safety stock \u22480. Pipeline (837) far exceeds the base-stock; ordering more would increase holding cost (holding cost = profit, so overstock is costly). There is a prior note about one possibly lost/delayed order, but given multiple concluded arrivals consistent with 3-period lead time and the very large pipeline, the conservative action is to place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost.",
