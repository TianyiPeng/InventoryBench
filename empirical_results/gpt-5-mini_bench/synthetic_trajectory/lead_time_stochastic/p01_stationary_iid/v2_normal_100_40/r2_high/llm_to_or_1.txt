  Mean: 93.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with on-hand=0 and no in-transit. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet (only Period_1 exists). Use promised lead time (default) = 2. Demand samples available (5 periods) will be used by backend default formulas: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high target fill) while avoiding explicit adjustments without evidence of demand or lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: recent observed demand samples have mean=93 units (Periods 1-5). On-hand=0, in-transit=156 (order from P1 not yet arrived in conclude \u2192 cannot infer actual lead time yet). Use promised lead time (default) to avoid prematurely changing L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline replenishment that covers review+lead demand while the in-transit order status resolves.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=317 (matches orders placed P1=156 + P2=161); no concluded arrivals yet for those orders (expected to appear in future concludes given promised L=2). Demand history samples (all periods) show mean=93, so using defaults keeps OR engine anchored to full-sample demand and promised lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised=2) and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level versus holding cost without overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=354, historical demand samples mean=93 (periods 1-5). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 show arrived=0 in their conclude messages, indicating delayed or missing arrivals but no concluded lead-time yet. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=2) because there are no concluded arrivals to reliably compute actual lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this balances service level using full-sample statistics while acknowledging the unsettled pipeline status. The chosen approach is conservative given the large in-transit volume (354) and ambiguous lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not conclude (arrived=0 in Period 1-3 conclude messages) \u2014 sustained lack of arrivals across 3 periods suggests delayed or lost shipments for recent orders.

Daily Profit: $1805.00, Daily Holding Cost: $98.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1707.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=98, in-transit=161. History shows delayed arrivals: Period 4 conclude reported arrivals from Period 1 (156 units, lead_time=3) and Period 3 (37 units, lead_time=1), indicating actual lead times deviate from promised=2. I choose L="calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times (uses all concluded lead-time observations). Demand parameters use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to anchor to full-sample demand (samples: 143,103,39,81,99) while the calculated L will expand the review+lead window to buffer against the observed delays and reduce risk of stockouts given in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods for at least one order (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4: P1\u2192P4, lead_time=3); observed lead-times so far = {3,1}.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1862.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=309; recent realized lead-times from concluded arrivals = {3,1} (avg=2). Demand has risen over the last 5 periods (demands: 3,17,81,95,114) so use recent data to capture the upward shift. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-times (avg=2). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 periods, capturing the recent demand increase. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance higher service needs after recent demand increase while respecting observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=410. History shows mixed lead-times observed in concluded messages: one order had lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4) and one had lead_time=1 (P3\u2192P4); some recent orders (P5,P6) have not yet concluded. Given this evidence I let the backend compute an average observed lead time (calculate) to capture the apparent variability. I use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies its base-stock formula using the inferred L while respecting pipeline inventory. This balances service (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise from mixed arrivals.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand samples (P1-5 = 143,103,39,81,99) show overall mean ~93. On-hand=0, in-transit=449 with some past delayed arrivals (orders from P1-P3 had long/no arrivals). Observed concluded lead-times = {3,1}; I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for the inferred lead time while the large in-transit quantity reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=79, in-transit=262. Historical concl: arrivals show mixed actual lead times = {3,1,3,1} (P1\u2192P4, P3\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P7\u2192P8) and earlier sustained delayed/no arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482. To capture the realized lead-time regime while letting the OR engine compute demand over review+lead, set L by calculating the average observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (accounting for longer realized lead time) against holding cost without overfitting recent noise.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10. Recent concluded history shows mixed lead-times: observed {3,1,3,1} \u2192 average 2 (matches promised). Demand samples (Periods1-5) have mean=93 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (several shipments previously delayed but recent pattern averages to 2). I choose L="calculate" to let backend use observed average lead-time; mu_hat="default" to set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures current overall demand level across review+lead); sigma_hat="default" to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using observed lead-time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and moderate demand.

Use calculated L to capture actual average lead time. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full demand samples; this balances service (higher base-stock for observed multi-period lead times) against holding cost while relying on the backend's capped ordering rule to limit order size given the sizable pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=2, in-transit=356. Historical concluded lead-times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (mixed but skewed toward 3). Recent demand samples show mean ~93 (samples: 143,103,39,81,99) with current low on-hand and large pipeline. I select L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures the mixed but elevated lead times). For demand and volatility I use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) with avoiding excessive holding given current large in-transit volume and observed lead-time variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=443. Concluded arrivals show observed lead-times = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3} (avg \u2248 2.29) indicating actual lead time is generally longer than the promised 2 and often 3. To let the OR engine infer the best consolidated lead time from observed concludes, I use L.method='calculate'. Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These settings let the OR engine raise target base-stock to cover the longer inferred lead time while using historical demand stats to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. History of concluded arrivals shows observed lead_times = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3} (recent majority = 3). Several recent shipments were delayed beyond promised 2, and pipeline is large (466) indicating many outstanding orders. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the mix but reflects the observed bias toward 3). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost given longer effective lead time and large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: recent realized lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (multiple concluded orders), demand has been high with frequent stockouts. On-hand=0, in-transit=398 (large pipeline but arrivals have been delayed historically). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized 3-period tendency). For demand I choose 'default' (1+L \xd7 mean of all samples) to anchor the forecast to full-sample mean scaled by chosen L; sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (higher L increases mu_hat) against holding cost given low on-hand and substantial in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods across multiple orders (evidence: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1110.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent history shows repeated 3-period arrivals for many orders (several P\u2192P+3 confirmations) with occasional 1-period outliers. On-hand=49, in-transit=364 (pipeline large). I choose to let the backend infer lead time from observed concludes (calculate) so L reflects realized behavior; use default demand and volatility (no recent regime detected in the five-sample series) so mu_hat and sigma_hat = backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps orders conservative given large pipeline and confirmed longer lead times while avoiding overreacting to short-lived demand noise.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=419. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (many P\u2192P+3) with occasional 1\u20132; average observed lead time ~2.4. To let the backend use observed lead-time history, set L="calculate". Demand history is small and no clear recent demand regime change, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base stock and cap consistently with inferred lead time. This balances service level (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20. Recent history shows multiple confirmed lead-times (observed set = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,1}, avg \u22482.45) \u2014 sustained predominance of 3-period arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=464 (large pipeline expected to arrive under longer lead time). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand forecast and uncertainty will use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base-stock consistent with estimated longer lead time while capping orders per its rule. This balances higher service level needed given frequent 3-period leads against holding cost since a large pipeline already exists.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

Several recent orders were delayed/lost but multiple confirms show a dominant 3-period lead time. I set L via 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time (captures mixed 1\u20133 observations). mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this balances service level against holding cost given elevated pipeline inventory and inferred longer lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=476. Historical concluded lead-times (from conclude messages) show multiple 3-period arrivals and some 1-2s; average observed lead time > promised 2. To account for the empirical lead-time, set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Demand estimates use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with large in-transit this lets the optimizer cap orders while the base-stock reflects the longer inferred lead-time and balances high profit vs low holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=476. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period deliveries (multiple P\u2192P+3 events) with some 1-2 period noise; recent history and carry-over indicate actual lead time is often longer than promised. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples (mean=93) scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); with large pipeline this avoids over-ordering while accounting for longer lead times.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead-times (mix of 3,2,1) but several confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier; shipments since Period_18 saw gaps and some late arrivals (risk of lost/delayed stock). I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to let backend average the most recent observed lead times and adapt to recent variability. Demand appears elevated and volatile recently (last 5 demands = 94,147,46,93,169; mean ~109.8), so I set mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes (1+L)-scaled recent mean and recent volatility, improving responsiveness to the current higher/variable demand while the recent_N L estimate accounts for lead-time drift. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost given current in-transit stock and delayed arrivals.

Historical concluded lead times observed = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,2} (11 samples) indicating frequent 3-period arrivals but some 1\u20132 period variation and occasional missing/delayed shipments earlier. Given large in-transit volume and mixed but majority-3 lead times, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average historical W). For demand forecasting and risk smoothing, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this lets the OR engine incorporate the inferred lead time while using full-sample demand stats. This balances service level (capturing longer observed lead times) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded lead-times = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,2} (avg\u22482.33) \u2014 majority are 3. Many recent periods show delayed arrivals but no new sustained regime change since Period_17. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time (captures multi-modal 1/2/3 signals). For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and large in-transit stock. No explicit adjustments to avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with predominantly 3-period lead times plus some 1\u20132 period events; observed lead-times average ~2.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=574 (large pipeline). Use calculated L to let backend infer average observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit quantity.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. History shows mixed observed lead times (many =3, some 1-2) and multiple recent periods with zero conclude arrivals despite large in-transit \u2192 evidence of variable/extended lead time but no new confirmed regime shift in demand. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded orders (captures the observed 3-period mode while accounting for 1-2 period cases). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2014 conservative approach given no sustained demand change and substantial pipeline that must be accounted for. This balances service level (higher L raises required pipeline cover) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Many past delayed shipments but multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals. I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times average (captures realized ~2\u20133 period behavior). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples; this keeps forecasting conservative while the backend applies the capped order logic to account for the large in-transit volume and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent history shows multiple confirmed lead times of 3 periods (several P\u2192P+3 arrivals) amid occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals and many delayed/no arrivals earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=574 (large pipeline that may include late shipments). I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time data (captures the frequent 3-period reality). For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively \u2014 conservative, data-driven estimates that let the capped ordering cap limit excessive replenishment given high in-transit inventory and holding cost sensitivity (profit $19 vs holding $1). This balances service level (accounting for true longer lead times) against holding costs and avoids over-ordering into the large existing pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period observations and some 1-2s; average of observed lead times is ~2.33, so use calculated lead time to reflect realized behavior. Demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand ~93, but we let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using chosen L so base-stock aligns with inferred lead time and existing pipeline. Methods chosen: L=calculate to capture observed lead-time > promised; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default let OR engine compute review+lead demand and volatility consistent with L, balancing service (profit high) vs holding cost (low).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Recent history shows many concluded lead-times clustered at 3 periods with some 1-2s; observed lead-times = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,2} (avg\u22482.27). Demand samples available (seed) have mean=93 units. With large pipeline (574) and confirmed multi-period delayed arrivals, I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual delivery behavior. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7overall sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which scales safety stock with the inferred longer lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. This balances service (higher L -> more inventory target) vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34. On-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (sustained); recent demand has settled around ~85-90 units (most recent 5 periods). I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times (will reflect confirmed 3-period behavior). I set mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 demand samples (captures current regime). I set sigma_hat='default' so backend uses overall-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level for confirmed longer lead times while avoiding excessive holding given large in-transit stock.

Recent long stretch of zero concludes before Period 34 indicates prior shipment delays/losses but current large in-transit (574) likely covers upcoming demand. I choose L=require backend calculation of average observed lead times to capture the confirmed longer lead-time regime. For demand parameters, use default aggregations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (accounts for longer inferred lead time) against holding cost given a large pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded arrivals show many lead-time observations (P1\u2192P4=3, P3\u2192P4=1, P5\u2192P8=3, P7\u2192P8=1, P9\u2192P12=3, P10\u2192P12=2, P11\u2192P14=3, P12\u2192P15=3, P13\u2192P16=3, P14\u2192P17=3, P16\u2192P17=1, P21\u2192P23=2). These 12 observed lead times average \u22482.33, so I use 'calculate' for L to reflect the empirical lead-time distribution (captures frequent 3-period delays and occasional 1-2 period arrivals). Demand history provided (samples: 143,103,39,81,99) has mean=93; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR engine compute base_stock consistent with the inferred lead time while preserving its cap calculation. This balances higher required pipeline coverage (due to longer empirical lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume; default stats avoid overfitting to short recent spikes and let the OR backend enforce the capped order size.

I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures the mix of 3,2,1). For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given higher inferred lead time while avoiding overconfidence amid missing arrivals and volatile demand.

Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times across many orders (evidence: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16 and carry-over notes). Several earlier periods showed missing/delayed shipments; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. I use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given the longer inferred lead time and current large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (several P\u2192P+3 events) alongside occasional shorter arrivals; this indicates actual lead time is longer than the promised 2. Set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this keeps the forecast anchored to full-sample demand while the longer inferred L increases pipeline coverage to protect service level given delayed shipments and large in-transit volume.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concludes show multiple confirmed lead_times (notably many =3), and recent long gaps/late arrivals earlier, so infer lead time from observed data rather than trusting promised. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples and subsequent periods) will be used by backend; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances using all available demand history while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time; large in-transit (574) plus default forecast avoids over-ordering given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead-times of 3 (several P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and some shorter arrivals; use 'calculate' so backend computes the average observed lead time. Demand shows no new sustained regime shift; use default demand/volatility methods ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). High profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) favors higher service level; defaults combined with calculate-L let OR backend set an appropriate base-stock while respecting observed lead-time behavior and existing pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Promised L=2 is unreliable; set explicit L=3 so OR backend plans across the longer pipeline. Demand has no clear recent regime shift requiring adjustment, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over samples). This choice aligns orders with observed arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded lead-times show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16) with some 1\u20132 period events; recent evidence favors a 3-period regime. I set L using recent_N (N=5) to bias toward the most recent confirmed lead-times while remaining robust to shorter anomalies. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the chosen L. This also accounts for the large in-transit volume when computing pipeline coverage.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead times (mostly 3 periods, some 1/2); pipeline is large but delayed. To reflect observed variability in lead time I use 'calculate' so backend averages all observed lead times. Demand history is long and no recent sustained demand regime change is evident, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These choices let the OR engine adjust base stock for the empirically estimated lead time while relying on full-sample demand statistics to balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: recent demand has been ~mid-high (last 5 demands = 87,117,97,76,113; mean\u224898). On-hand=0, in-transit=574 (large pipeline; some past shipments had long/variable lead times with confirmed 3-period deliveries). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 observations but reflects confirmed 3-period behavior). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most recent regime. This balances service (protects against recent elevated demand) while avoiding overreacting to older low samples; large in-transit volume reduces need for aggressive extra explicit orders.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=574. Historical concluded lead-times (from conclude messages) = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,2} \u2192 average ~2.33. Multiple sustained observations of 3-period arrivals earlier (Periods 4\u201317) and intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals; recent pipeline large but uncertain. I set L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the mix and longer-than-promised arrivals). I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the model inflate demand coverage for the longer inferred lead time and balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical conclude messages show many observed lead times of 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) with some shorter exceptions; therefore I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average (captures the sustained shift toward 3). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full demand history; this balances service level (captures higher effective lead time) while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy demands given large pipeline and holding cost.
