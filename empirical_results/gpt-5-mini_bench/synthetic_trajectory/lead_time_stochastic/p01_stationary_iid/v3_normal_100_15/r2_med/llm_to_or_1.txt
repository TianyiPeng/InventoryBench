Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical demand samples (88,133,93,108,110) give mean \u2248106.4. Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals yet to suggest a different lead time. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, providing a balanced base-stock against holding cost while we observe arrivals for lead-time validation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=136 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time; promised lead time remains best prior. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (leveraging full historical demand). This balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline (136 units) and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: On-hand=0, in-transit=268 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet (P1 and P2 both show arrived=0 in their conclude messages), but arrivals for P1/P2 will occur during Period_3 and only be visible in Period_4 conclude\u2014so do not treat shipments as lost. Demand history (all samples) mean=106.4. I use default lead time (promised=2) because there is no concluded evidence of a lead-time change. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, which balances service level and holding cost given no confirmed demand regime change or lead-time shift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (orders from P1-P3). Historical concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133, indicating delayed shipments. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean demand ~106. Default promised lead time is 2 but shipments are delayed; however actual lead time is not yet conclusively observed as a different fixed integer (no concluded arrivals to compute W). To keep OR backend aligned with contract and demand history while acknowledging delays, I select default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility estimators so the engine uses all samples to compute base_stock; this avoids overreacting to possibly transient delays while providing conservative ordering via backend cap. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given holding=1 and profit=4.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (total 335 units) have not arrived by Period_4 conclude; monitor for potential lost shipments or extended lead time.

Daily Profit: $468.00, Daily Holding Cost: $86.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=86, in-transit=132. History shows arrived orders with observed lead times 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4), indicating lead-time instability and at least one shipment with extended lead time. To account for actual lead-time evidence while letting the OR engine compute appropriate pipeline targets, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default and sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, providing a conservative base-stock reflecting the inferred longer lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=3, in-transit=261; recent demand samples mean = (88+133+93+108+110)/5=106.4. Observed lead times from concluded messages: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1 (avg=2). Promised L=2 but variability and a past delayed arrival motivate using calculated average lead time. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std, preserving statistical grounding while accounting for inferred lead time. This balances service (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given low on-hand and large in-transit.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=389. Historical demand samples mean=106.4 (Periods 1\u20135). Concluded arrivals show variable lead times: Period1\u2192Period4 (LT=3), Period3\u2192Period4 (LT=1). Some earlier shipments were delayed but later concluded; pipeline is large (389) so outstanding coverage is high. I select L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full sample history while letting L reflect actual observed lead-time behavior. This balances service (profit/holding implies a high target service level) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5): [88,133,93,108,110] with on-hand=0 and in-transit=429. History shows mixed actual lead times (P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1) and several outstanding arrivals (orders from P2,P5-P7 not yet concluded) suggesting lead-time variability and possible lost/delayed shipments. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability vs promised=2). For demand forecasting I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain lead time and sizeable pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=81, in-transit=260. Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,1} (avg 2). Pipeline is large so use inferred average lead time rather than promised to account for mixed delays. Set L to calculate (backend will use observed average). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Observed variable lead times with average 2 periods (evidence: P1\u2192P4 L=3; P3\u2192P4 L=1; P5\u2192P8 L=3; P7\u2192P8 L=1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concluded lead times observed: P1\u2192P4 L=3, P3\u2192P4 L=1, P5\u2192P8 L=3, P7\u2192P8 L=1 (avg=2). Several earlier orders were delayed but later arrived; pipeline is large (343) so risk of overstock exists. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect actual variability (method=calculate). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples (uses full history of samples Periods 1\u20135). This balances service level given mixed lead times while avoiding aggressive uplifts from short recent samples when substantial pipeline exists.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=421. Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (observed average \u22482) and several earlier delayed shipments (Periods 1\u20133 delayed). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): [88,133,93,108,110] with ongoing demands through Period 10 (see history). I choose L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variable/shifted lead times). For demand sizing I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 this balances service level (protecting against observed lead-time variability and in-transit stock) vs holding cost. This setup relies on backend's capped-order logic while acknowledging in-transit inventory; no explicit inflation of mu/sigma to avoid excessive holding given substantial pipeline (421 units).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent concluded history shows variable lead times but average = 2 (observed Ls: 3,1,3,1 \u2192 avg 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=432 (large pipeline). Demand history is noisy but no sustained recent regime shift (need 3+ periods of consistent change). Use calculated L to reflect observed average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) to set base-stock while respecting historical volatility. This balances service (given large in-transit) vs holding costs conservatively.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=79, in-transit=271. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence includes L=3,1,3,1,3,2) with a recent average ~2.25. Some past shipments were delayed/missing but recent arrivals confirm variable but centered near 2\u20133 periods. I set L via recent_N=4 to react to the most recent lead-time observations (captures recent variability while smoothing single outliers). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this scales demand and volatility for the chosen lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit bulk. This aims to avoid over-ordering if delayed shipments arrive and to maintain service through the lead window.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical sample set (used by backend) available; observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) so use inferred average lead time rather than promised to reflect variability. I choose L=calculate to let backend compute average observed lead time from concluded history. Demand forecast uses default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to leverage full sample set (stable recent demand without 3+ period sustained regime shift). Volatility uses default to reflect historical variability. This balances service level (using observed average lead time) against holding cost while recognizing many shipments were delayed but not definitively lost; no new sustained changepoint meets the carry-over threshold.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=415. Historical concluded lead times are variable (observed Ls = 3,1,3,1,3,2,3 \u2192 avg \u22482.29). Demand samples show stable mean around ~106.4 from provided samples and recent periods show typical demands near that level. To account for the observed variable/longer lead times, set L to be inferred from observed history (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine raise the base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time while the cap prevents excessive orders given volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=428. Historical concluded lead times are variable (observed Ls: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3 \u2014 avg \u22482.29). Demand sample history (5 samples) has mean=106.4; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Because lead time has shown persistent variability, use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let the backend infer the best L; retain default demand estimates using all samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances increased pipeline due to longer/variable lead times while avoiding overreaction to short-term demand noise.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=350. Recent demand (Periods 12-16) ~ [82,97,110,98,98] \u2014 stable around ~97. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133), so infer lead time from observed history rather than trusting promised. Set L to 'calculate' to use average of all observed lead times (backend will compute ~2.3). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (Periods 12\u201316) where demand is stable. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of near-100 demand) against holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_18. On-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical concluded arrivals show recent persistent 3-period lead times (multiple P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17 observations). To capture the recent shift toward longer lead times while keeping demand forecast anchored to available demand samples (Periods 1\u20135), I set L using a recent average of observed lead times (recent_N) to quickly reflect the confirmed longer lead-time regime. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples; this balances increased pipeline needs from longer lead time against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P9\u2192P12 L=3; P13\u2192P16 L=3; P14\u2192P17 L=3)

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=426. Recent conclude messages show a sustained lead-time of 3 periods (multiple orders observed with L=3 in Periods 12,16,17,18). Demand historical mean from provided samples ~106.4. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead, I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples \u2192 covers 4 periods) and default sigma_hat (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This biases orders toward higher pipeline to protect against confirmed longer lead times while letting the OR engine calculate service-level safety stock given profit/holding costs.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent concluded history shows sustained lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals since P9\u2013P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=429 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 but evidence supports using L=3 (explicit) to capture observed delays and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level given Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1 and the large in-transit volume. This reduces stockout risk given extended lead times while letting OR cap limit excessive ordering.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent demand samples (historical seed) mean=106.4; observed arrivals in concluded history show a sustained lead-time of 3 periods (Periods 9\u201318 evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (useful buffer but arrivals are only visible after conclude). Therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures the longer review+lead period and scales uncertainty); this increases target base-stock to cover 4 periods of demand while sigma scaling widens safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost given the higher perceived lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=434, recent sold/demand around 80\u2013130 per period. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed Ls = [3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3]; avg \u22482.44) and earlier carry-over confirmed L=3 in Period 18. Pipeline (434) is substantial vs typical per-period demand (~100), so risk of overstock if we assume shorter L; but evidence supports a longer-than-promised lead time. I choose to let backend infer average observed lead time (calculate) so orders account for variable/longer arrivals; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on samples) to keep forecasts tied to historical sample set and the inferred L. This balances service level (using measured longer lead times) while default volatility prevents overreacting to recent noise.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Recent concluded history shows persistent lead time = 3 periods (several P\u2192P+3 arrivals), and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=434. Historical sample mean demand = 106.4 units/period; with L inferred via concluded messages, pipeline (~434) already covers \u22484 periods of demand (~426 units) so no aggressive up-weighting of mean or variance is needed. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average concluded lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given elevated pipeline while avoiding extra holding cost buildup if some in-transit shipments are lost or further delayed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=429. Recent concluded history shows consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with L=3 since Period 9 and confirmed at Period 18). Promised L=2 appears incorrect for planning. I set L explicit=3 to align forecast horizon with observed arrivals. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=3, capturing full review+lead demand and empirical volatility. This addresses overdue/lost shipment risk by expanding the pipeline coverage to observed lead time, improving service level while backend caps orders to limit holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but predominantly 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations); average observed lead time \u22482.45. Several earlier periods showed missing/delayed shipments but recent concludes (including P23 arrivals from P20 with L=3) confirm extended lead times. I select L=calculate so the backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded history. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; with the large in-transit pipeline this balances service level vs holding cost without overfitting to short recent spikes. This approach handles possible lost/late shipments by letting observed lead-time data drive the lead-time estimate while using full-sample demand stats for stability.

To account for observed extended lead time and overdue shipments, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand/statistics so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), providing a conservative replenishment that balances service level and holding cost given longer lead time and currently large pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time stabilized at 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations through Period 18). Recent demand (Periods 22\u201326 = 105,86,100,86,81) averages ~91.6. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period actual lead time so arrivals are timed correctly. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (N=5 captures last five demands where behavior is consistent). This balances service (cover 4 periods of demand given L=3) versus holding cost by avoiding over-reliance on older data when lead time changed.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Recent conclude history shows persistent 3-period arrivals (Periods 9\u219212,13\u219216,14\u219217, etc.) and late/variable shipments earlier; treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Use L explicit=3. For demand, recent observed demand (~Periods in-game) centers near ~100; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the most recent regime while covering review+lead horizon (1+L=4 periods). This raises target base-stock and increases safety stock given inventory in-transit and shipment variability, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 100,86,81,96,119) averages ~96.4 units/period \u2014 demand remains near ~100. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline; several past shipments delayed but Period_18 confirmed lead_time=3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and observed arrivals (multiple P\u2192P+3). To size the review+lead demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean/vol reflecting the latest regime and avoids overreacting to older low-volume periods. Using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility. This balances higher service needs from long lead time against holding cost by relying on recent demand samples and the OR backend's capped ordering.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded lead times show mixed values (observations: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.45) and multiple delayed/lost shipments earlier; large in-transit suggests outstanding arrivals may cover upcoming demand but timing is uncertain. I select L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20133 period variability). For demand forecast I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and the existing large pipeline. These settings are conservative about lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical conclude messages show multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 repeatedly (P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) \u2014 recent sustained evidence confirms actual lead time = 3 periods, and many prior orders experienced delayed arrivals or temporary losses. To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and ensure pipeline covers the review+lead period, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 and lets the backend apply its capped ordering logic while accounting for the longer lead time and existing large in-transit volume.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical conclude messages show lead times stabilized at 3 periods since Period 18 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals); many earlier delays/losses but recent evidence supports treating actual lead time as 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine will order sufficiently far ahead. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (conservative, uses full history). This balances service (longer L to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost because the backend's base-stock and cap will account for profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical demand samples (periods 1\u20135) mean=106.4; recent five-period demand (P28\u2013P32) mean=99. Recent concluded arrivals frequently show a 3-period lead time; multiple later periods (P24\u2013P32) show no arrivals despite orders, and a large pipeline (431) is outstanding. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained evidence for 3-period actual lead time. I use mu_hat recent_N N=5 so the (1+L)-period demand forecast leans on the most recent regime (reduces forecast versus long-run mean). I keep sigma_hat default so the OR backend uses overall sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to match actual slower arrivals (avoid under-ordering) while tempering demand forecast with recent lower average to limit excess holding costs given holding=$1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments sustained from Period 24\u201332: no concluded arrivals for several orders while in-transit=431 units \u2014 risk of lost shipments or extended delays; treat actual lead time as 3 periods for planning.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=431 with many prior missing/delayed shipments; recent concluded history (Periods 9,12,14,16,17,23, etc.) shows frequent 3-period arrivals and sustained delays since Period 24\u201332. Treat actual lead time as 3 for planning to protect service level given large in-transit exposure. I set L explicitly to 3 (explicit lead time) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use a 1+L=4 review+lead horizon. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled for the 4-period demand window; this balances higher safety stock from confirmed longer lead time against holding cost, while relying on historical demand samples for stable forecasting.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=431, historical concluded arrivals show sustained 3-period lead times and prolonged missing shipments. To avoid under-ordering given observed L=3, set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the provided sample mean (88,133,93,108,110 => mean=106.4) across the review+lead window (1+L=4) => mu_hat=4*106.4=425.6 (explicit). Estimate demand volatility from sample std (\u224817.61) scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 => sigma_hat\u224835.22 (explicit). These choices increase pipeline cover for the longer confirmed lead time and raise safety stock to balance high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 36. On-hand=0, in-transit=456 with many past delayed/lost shipments and multiple concluded arrivals indicating a 3-period actual lead time. Use L explicit=3 to reflect sustained extended lead time (reduces stockouts from unseen pipeline delays). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history; this leverages all samples while the explicit L raises cover for the longer pipeline. Profit vs holding (4 vs 1) implies a high service quantile; default mu/sigma with L=3 balances service level and holding cost given current evidence of extended lead time and large in-transit quantity.

These choices bias orders upward to cover the extended lead time while letting the OR engine cap order size to control holding cost risks given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time (Periods 9\u201318 and Period 33 evidence). Using (1+L)*mean demand -> mu_hat explicit=425.6 units (4\xd7mean(88,133,93,108,110)=4\xd7106.4) to cover review+lead demand. Demand volatility from samples: sample std\u224817.61, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 gives sigma_hat explicit\u224835.22. These parameters increase order coverage for the longer observed lead time and balance higher service level vs. holding cost given significant in-transit backlog and lost/delayed shipment risk.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Multiple historical conclude messages (Periods 12,16,17,18,23,33) and carry-over notes indicate sustained extended lead times and prior confirmation to plan with L=3. Many earlier orders were delayed/lost; current large in-transit suggests shipments already en route but arriving with ~3-period lag. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time for planning. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, producing a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the longer lead time. This avoids under-ordering given the large in-transit and the observed 3-period arrivals, and lets the capped policy limit order sizes to reduce risk of excess holding given uncertain arrivals.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=431; historical concludes (Periods 9,12,14,16,17,23,37,39) and prior carry-over indicate sustained extended lead times and many delayed/lost shipments. Evidence supports planning with actual lead time = 3 (sustained since Period 18 and reinforced by Period 33 insight). I therefore set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer realized pipeline. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level increase needed for longer lead time against holding cost given high in-transit volume. This choice accounts for overdue/in-transit units and avoids under-ordering while the shipment-loss risk is monitored.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service (longer coverage for L=3) against holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. History shows sustained delayed/missing arrivals and prior conclusions that actual lead time is 3 periods (multiple orders confirmed L=3 and prolonged no-arrival windows). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering given large in-transit pipeline. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine will compute (1+L)-scaled demand mean and volatility consistent with L=3; this balances higher required replenishment for service against the $1 holding cost by letting the backend compute the base-stock and cap using the observed demand stats.

To ensure pipeline covers (1+L) demand and guard against lost shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples, giving a conservative increase in target base-stock to prioritize service given high in-transit uncertainty and high profit/holding ratio (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent realized demand averages ~106 units/period (historical samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline but many past delays); several prior periods confirm sustained extended lead time \u22483 and missing/delayed shipments, so plan with L=3 to be conservative. Set L via explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer actual lead time. Use mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures demand across review+lead period given limited sample set). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, preserving observed variability for safety stock. These choices balance high service level (profit>holding) while acknowledging delayed arrivals and avoiding further under-ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_47: demand context shows historically ~5-sample mean ~106.4 with frequent long delays and many missing/concluded arrivals; current on-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline with prior missing/delayed shipments). Multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 3 for planning. To protect service level given high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) and large uncertain pipeline, set lead time explicitly to 3 so m\xfb covers (1+L) periods; use default m\xfb and sigm\xe2 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances higher replenishment target against holding cost while acknowledging overdue/in-transit risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=431 with history showing sustained delayed/missing arrivals and prior conclusions indicating actual lead time \u22483. To avoid stockouts and because shipments have been delayed repeatedly, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using all samples (conservative pooling given no clear recent demand regime change). This increases pipeline coverage (1+3 periods) to balance high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) and mitigate lost-shipment risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=431; historical demand samples (seed) mean=106.4. Multiple concluded periods and prior carry-over insights confirm actual lead time has shifted to 3 periods and large in-transit volume suggests treating shipments as delayed but expected. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time (useful because promised=2 would understate pipeline). For mu_hat I provide an explicit (1+L)\xd7forecast = 4\xd7106.4 = 425.6 to cover current review+lead demand. For sigma_hat I provide an explicit volatility estimate = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(samples) \u2248 2\xd715.76 = 31.52 to reflect observed variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service level given extended lead time while the explicit sigma supports appropriate safety stock vs. holding cost tradeoff.
