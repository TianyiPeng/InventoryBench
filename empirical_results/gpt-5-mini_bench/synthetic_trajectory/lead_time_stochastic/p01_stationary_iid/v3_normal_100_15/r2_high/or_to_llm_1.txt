{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) and past lost/delayed shipments; no new conclusive lead-time shift since Period 11 insight. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=320. Recent demand history (Periods 20\u201349) clusters ~80\u2013130 units/period (roughly \u2248100 avg). OR recommends 22 using promised L=2, but OR cannot see delayed/lost shipments or that a large pipeline (320) already exists. Risk trade-off: ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) if the in-transit 320 arrives; not ordering risks stockout if a large portion of the pipeline is lost. Given substantial pipeline (320 \u2248 3.2 periods of demand at \u2248100/d), and observed frequent arrivals from in-transit in past periods, prefer to avoid adding inventory now to minimize holding cost. Final strategy: override OR by placing 0 units this period, monitor the Period 50 conclude for which in-transit units actually arrive to update lead-time/loss inference and adjust future orders.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 0 units (vs OR's 22) because a large in-transit pipeline (320 units \u2248 ~3.2 periods of demand) likely covers near-term demand and avoids extra holding cost amid variable/uncertain lead times.",
