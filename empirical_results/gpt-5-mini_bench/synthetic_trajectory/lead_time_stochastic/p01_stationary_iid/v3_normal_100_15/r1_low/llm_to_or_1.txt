Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand mean = 106.4 units/period (samples P1\u2013P5). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation: L default (promised=2). mu_hat default -> (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This conservative choice relies on full-sample statistics until we observe concluded arrivals or sustained regime changes; it balances service level (covers 3 periods of expected demand) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=136 (order from P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time not confirmed; use promised lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) will be used; choose default methods so backend sets mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: recent demands moderate (samples available). On-hand=0, in-transit=270 (orders from P1+P2). Two consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 but this is only 2 periods of missing arrival\u2014insufficient to confirm a lead-time change. Use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned and avoid overreacting. Therefore select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given current in-transit coverage.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Observed concluded history shows demand in concluded periods: P1=111, P2=126, P3=90. On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Promised lead time=2 but only P1 orders are overdue for arrival (order placed P1 should have shown up in P3 conclude and did not); this is a single overdue signal\u2014insufficient to confirm a sustained lead-time change or lost shipments. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available samples, letting it balance service vs. holding given profit=holding cost. This approach preserves pipeline coverage while avoiding premature regime changes based on a single missed arrival.

Daily Profit: $124.00, Daily Holding Cost: $72.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent concluded data shows arrivals from P1 (lead_time=3) and P3 (lead_time=1) \u2014 average observed lead_time = 2 which matches promised 2. On-hand=72, in-transit=134; note the P2 order (134) has not concluded and is overdue but single missed arrival is not yet a sustained pattern. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (88,133,93,108,110) shows no sustained regime shift; use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) and full-sample mean/std. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods of demand) against holding cost given profit=holding, and keeps policy conservative until more lead-time evidence accumulates.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6. Recent demands (P1-5) average ~106.4; on-hand=0, in-transit=271. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1) \u2014 average observed lead time = 2. Use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend sets (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full sample set (stable recent demands) and lets OR balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=407. Historical concluded lead times: order P1\u2192arrived P4 \u2192 lead_time=3; order P3\u2192arrived P4 \u2192 lead_time=1. No sustained shift in lead time (only two observations, conflicting). Several recent orders (P2,P5,P6) remain unconfirmed \u2014 possible delays or lost shipments; therefore be conservative but use observed average lead time. I choose L via "calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (uses evidence rather than promised). For demand forecasting I choose "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; with limited data and no confirmed demand regime change, this balances service level vs holding cost while letting the OR engine cap orders based on its statistical model. This approach acknowledges overdue shipments (high in-transit) by not reducing forecasted demand, avoiding stockouts if some in-transit arrive late.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=422. Historical concluded lead times: P4 shows arrivals for orders placed P1 (lead_time=3) and P3 (lead_time=1) \u2014 evidence of variable actual lead time. Recent orders (P5=137, P6=136, P7=15) have not concluded, suggesting possible lost/delayed shipments but not enough consistent lead-time increase to pick a fixed explicit L > promised. I select L.method='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures variability 3 and 1). For demand I use mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). Using calculate for L plus default demand/stat methods lets the backend adapt base-stock to observed lead-time variability while keeping demand forecast anchored in full-sample statistics. I note pipeline may be overstated if some in-transit shipments are lost; the chosen settings are conservative because they use observed lead times rather than promised and full-sample demand to avoid overreacting to short-term demand noise.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 5-7 (137,136,15 units) have not concluded by Period_8 (3 consecutive periods of non-arrival), indicating possible lost shipments or sustained delivery delays.

Period_9 start. Recent demand average = 106.4 (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). On-hand=66, in-transit=276; history shows some shipments delayed but concluded lead times observed = {3,1,3,1} giving average 2.0. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed behavior.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Recent conclude messages reveal variable actual lead times (observed 1 and 3 periods) and some delayed arrivals but current in-transit=349 with on-hand=0. I choose to let backend infer a data-driven lead time average from observed concludes (method=calculate) and use default demand aggregation and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula consistently while accounting for the inferred lead-time. This balances service level (handles lead-time variability) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

Several orders previously overdue suggest intermittent 3-period delays but not yet a sustained permanent shift. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding= $1), I use an L estimated from observed lead times (calculate) so the OR engine learns the effective lead time; I set demand and volatility using the most recent 10 periods (recent_N N=10) to capture current demand regime without overreacting to single-period spikes or delays.

Demand samples mean = (88+133+93+108+110)/5 = 106.4. To reflect observed variable lead time, I let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples; this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain actual lead time and large existing pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent mean demand = 106.4 (samples P1-5). On-hand=38, in-transit=270 (many outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2] (avg 2.0) so no persistent shift from promised L=2 but high variability (1\u20133). To balance service vs holding cost I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine uses full-sample stats and the inferred lead time; this keeps orders large enough to cover the (L+1) periods of demand while letting the cap constrain order size given pipeline. This approach is conservative given in-transit stock and past delayed arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=333. Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (from conclude messages P4,P4,P8,P8,P12,P12) indicating average lead time > promised 2. Use 'calculate' so backend sets L to the average observed lead time. Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift; use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock while accounting for the longer inferred lead time and existing pipeline. This balances service level (by increasing L-based coverage) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period_15: recent concluded history shows variable lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1,1,3,2} \u2192 avg 2.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand history (Periods1\u201314) mean \u2248104.6; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given the inferred L and full-sample demand statistics.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=374. Historical concluded lead times observed: {3,1,3,1,1,3,2} (avg=2.0). Demand sample mean (provided samples) = 106.4 units. Several prior orders showed multi-period delays/losses but observed lead times average to 2, matching promised lead time. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR engine reflect actual variability. I use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because no sustained demand regime shift is evident in the small sample set. This balances service level vs holding cost while allowing the OR engine to cap orders given in-transit pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=311. Recent concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time for multiple orders (P1->P4=3, P5->P8=3, P9->P12=3, P13->P16=3), so actual lead time appears to be 3 (promised was 2). Demand history (P1\u2013P16) mean \u2248104.7 units/period, stable around 90\u2013126 with no sustained demand regime shift. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery behavior so the OR backend will cover the longer pipeline; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L), which balances service level against holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time. Pipeline (in-transit=311) plus new orders should cover the 4-period demand horizon implied by L=3.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=382. Recent concluded lead times (Periods 12,16,17,8) = {3,2,3,3} indicate a shift toward ~3-period actual lead time; average of last 4 observed lead times \u22482.75, so I use recent_N for L to capture this. Demand history base samples (88,133,93,108,110) show mean \u2248104.4; no sustained demand regime change detected, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). Choosing a longer recent-N L biases orders to cover additional in-transit/delayed arrivals (reducing stockouts) while default mu/sigma keeps variability estimates stable to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=382. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time in multiple cycles (orders P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17). Demand history (samples provided) average ~106.4. To protect service given observed L\u22483 and high in-transit, set L using recent lead-time evidence (recent_N=3) so backend builds base-stock over (1+L) periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17)

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times: {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3} (multiple 3-period observations including recent P13->P16, P14->P17, P5->P8) indicating actual lead time > promised. I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. Demand samples mean=106.4; to let OR backend compute demand across review+lead I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default (uses all samples). This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to full-sample demand while letting inferred lead time adjust the (1+L) horizon, balancing service level given substantial in-transit pipeline vs holding cost.

To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7long-run mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7long-run std from the available demand samples; this balances service level (higher coverage for confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost and accounts for missing/delayed shipments by lengthening the coverage window.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) with some 1\u20132 period cases; average observed lead time \u22482.22. Several past shipments (Periods 5\u20137) showed prolonged non-arrival before concluding, so I let the backend compute an L from observed lead times (calculate) to capture that empirical mix. Demand samples mean=106.4; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain but empirically longer lead times.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period actual lead time (e.g., P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17, corroborated by arrival timing through Period 19). Several orders (Periods 5-7) showed prolonged non-arrival historically, so I use an explicit L=3 to match observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level (higher base stock with L=3) against holding cost given profit=holding. This addresses delayed/lost shipments by increasing the covered review+lead demand window.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed 3-period actual lead time (better aligns pipeline timing and avoids under-ordering). I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history (leveraging all samples to stabilize forecast). This balances service (higher L raises required pipeline coverage) against holding cost given profit=holding cost; using observed lead time prevents chronic stockouts while letting the backend apply its capped ordering policy.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: recent demand has been moderate (~95 units on average over last 5 periods) with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead times clustering at 3 (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17). To reflect the observed lead-time behavior I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). For demand I use the most recent regime (last 5 periods: P20-P24) where mean demand = ~95; so I set mu_hat method to recent_N with N=5 to focus the base-stock on current demand. Volatility likewise uses recent behavior, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices prioritize service given the long/variable lead time while limiting excess inventory by tying forecasts to the most recent observed demand regime.

Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201325 = 97,114,60,97,109,89) appears to represent the current regime (mean \u224894.3); use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L) periods of demand. Volatility appears stable but shifted vs earlier samples; use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects current variance. These choices align pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical conclude messages show multiple observed lead times, with repeated 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) indicating actual lead time \u22483. Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent pattern shows sustained 3-period lead. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand forecasting I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost using full historical demand given no strong recent demand regime shift. With on-hand=0 and large pipeline=423, the backend will cap ordering appropriately to avoid overstock while covering (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently show 3-period actual lead time (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17). Given the confirmed LT=3 and substantial in-transit stock, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts across the correct review+lead window. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend leverages full sample history; this avoids overfitting to recent zero-on-hand periods while the large pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk and holding cost tradeoffs.

LLM Rationale:

Given these confirmed lead-time observations, set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, preserving full-sample demand signal while accounting for the inferred longer lead time. This balances service (captures increased pipeline requirements when L>promised) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from full-sample variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 observations) so actual lead time > promised 2. Many recent periods show zero arrivals (possible delayed/lost shipments) but sustained evidence confirms actual lead time ~3. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average (captures confirmed 3-period pattern). For demand, no clear recent regime shift in the last 5-10 demand samples (samples span 88\u2013134, mean ~104), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service level (recognizing longer effective lead time) against holding cost; keeping default demand estimates avoids overreacting to transient zeros while L calculation forces larger pipeline cover for delayed deliveries. On-hand + in-transit (423) currently provides cover; using calculated L increases target pipeline to reduce stockouts if shipments are delayed/lost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time \u22483 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) and several missing/delayed shipments earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=423. I will let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) to capture the confirmed longer lead time, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples respectively. This balances service level (by raising pipeline cover when L>promised) against holding cost using backend's base-stock formula.

Because shipments have been delayed/lost previously but lead time is now confirmed as 3, I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR backend sizes pipeline for the longer delivery. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it scale forecasts and safety stock for L=3 while the explicit L handles overdue/lost shipment risk.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, etc.). Given confirmed LT=3, I set L explicit=3 so the OR engine sizes review+lead coverage correctly. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed from all historical demand samples; this leverages the full demand history (no sustained recent demand regime change detected) while the explicit L addresses observed delivery delays and prevents under-ordering. The large in-transit pipeline plus L=3 should reduce new orders until pipeline depletes, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but a sustained pattern of 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 events); several orders (Periods 5-7) were delayed/lost historically. I set L="calculate" so the backend infers average realized lead time from observed concluded messages (captures the persistent 3-period behavior rather than the promised 2). Demand samples (Periods 1-5: 88,133,93,108,110 and subsequent periods through 38) show no recent sustained mean shift requiring an explicit recent-weighted forecast, so I use default estimators for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This balances service level (accounting for longer realized lead time) against holding cost and leverages the backend's base-stock computation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. History shows repeated confirmed lead_time=3 (multiple concluded messages P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) and prolonged delayed/lost shipments earlier. Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the backend sizes pipeline for (1+L) periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the estimator incorporate full historical demand while accounting for the longer lead time.

Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time \u22483 periods repeatedly; several orders (Periods 5-7) experienced multi-period delays/losses but current pipeline is large. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time so the OR backend forecasts over a 4-period demand window. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples\u2014this balances service level (covers multi-period demand given L=3) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: recent on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed repeatedly through Period_19). Many past missing/delayed shipments were observed but current pipeline is large (423) so risk of stockout is low this period. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed reality; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) periods using the full sample history. This aligns ordering with the confirmed longer lead time and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost using the usual base-stock formula.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, etc.). Because lead time is confirmed longer than promised, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts demand over review+lead appropriately. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given longer lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand history (Periods 1\u201343) shows stable average ~100 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 \u2014 many in-transit units have not concluded, consistent with prior prolonged delays; historical concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 3 periods. To protect service given confirmed LT=3 and ~100 mean demand, I set L explicitly to 3 so the backend sizes the review+lead period correctly. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, which yields a base-stock that balances profit=holding cost (q=0.5) while accounting for full 4-period demand exposure. This conservative approach addresses overdue/possibly lost shipments by stocking to cover the longer confirmed lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with observed lead times (mostly 3 periods, some 1\u20132), average observed lead time \u22482.38; several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but later periods confirm longer lead times. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time from concluded messages. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and existing in-transit inventory. This lets the OR engine cap orders appropriately while accounting for the longer realized lead times.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals), while promised L=2; to protect against observed delivery delays I set L explicit=3. Demand history is limited; I let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using all samples (default) so base-stock=(1+L)*mean is applied over the 4-period review+lead window, increasing order targets to cover demand during the longer realized lead time while the backend's service-level cap limits extreme orders.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals (confirmed at Period 19) with some 1-2 period anomalies and earlier lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the sustained shift to ~3). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (uses full history to stabilize forecast and lets increased L raise required pipeline cover to protect service level given delivery delays).

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17), and there are prior missing/delayed shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time (promised=2 but confirmed 3). Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the base-stock and cap use demand history adjusted for the longer lead time. This balances higher pipeline coverage (to avoid stockouts given long/confirmed lead time) while letting the OR engine trade off profit vs holding cost.

I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period lead time).
