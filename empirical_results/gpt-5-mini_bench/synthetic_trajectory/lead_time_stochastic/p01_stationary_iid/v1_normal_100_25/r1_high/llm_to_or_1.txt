Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_stochastic\p01_stationary_iid\v1_normal_100_25\r1_high\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 100), ('Period_2', 69), ('Period_3', 92), ('Period_4', 77), ('Period_5', 111)]
  Mean: 89.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; promised lead time (2) is used. Historical demand samples available (100,69,92,77,111) will be used by backend to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. Using default methods keeps forecasts anchored to full-sample statistics given no evidence of a regime shift or delayed shipments. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost conservatively.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Promised lead time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=118 (order from P1), P1 conclude shows arrived=0 which is expected with promised L=2 (arrival during Period 3). No evidence of lost shipment or lead-time change yet. Historical samples show mean demand ~89.8; using default (1+L) aggregation keeps backend forecast conservative and leverages full history. Use default sigma to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service level (profit>>holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=239 (orders from P1+P2). Concluded messages show no arrivals yet (arrived=0 for P1 and P2 orders); this is insufficient (needs >=3 periods) to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Use conservative defaults so OR backend uses promised lead time and full historical demand samples to compute base stock. Defaults balance service vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=348, three consecutive concluded periods (P1\u2013P3) show zero arrivals despite orders placed. This signals shipments are delayed/lost; I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect extended effective lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples (robust aggregate forecast) \u2014 this raises the base-stock to cover the longer coverage period while letting the OR engine cap orders per its safety rule. This balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by increasing protection against stockouts given observed missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 produced zero arrivals in their conclude messages (3 consecutive periods) \u2014 indicates sustained delivery failure/delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1353.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead=3) and order from Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (lead=1). I therefore set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times. Demand history (samples mean \u224889.8) implies (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 demand across review+lead; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Current on-hand (148) + in-transit (217) provides coverage vs. expected demand; using calculated L and defaults balances service level (captures observed longer lead) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1852.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: observed mixed actual lead times in concludes (W=3 for P1->P4 and W=1 for P3->P4). With limited but conflicting lead-time evidence, I use the calculated average lead time to balance risk vs. holding cost. Historical demand samples (100,69,92,77,111) show no sustained regime shift; use all-sample default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This approach addresses prior missing arrivals by letting inferred average lead time reflect recent variability while avoiding overfitting short-term noise.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: recent demand samples (100,69,92,77,111) show mean ~91.8. Visible concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (large pipeline) with some prior delayed shipments\u2014risk of overdue/lost earlier orders exists but not enough consistent evidence to override sample-based demand. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (2.0) rather than promised blind value. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(samples), leveraging full sample set and smoothing demand estimation across the review+lead period. This balances service level (using observed lead-time info) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_8. History shows multiple confirmed lead times (observed W = 3,1,3 from concluded arrivals) indicating actual lead time differs from promised and averages >2. On-hand=0, in-transit=338 (large pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 3,1,3 pattern). Demand history (100,69,92,77,111) is stable without a sustained regime change, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps while respecting the inferred longer lead time. This balances higher replenishment coverage given delayed arrivals against holding cost while relying on observed pipeline to prevent over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent observed lead times from conclude messages = {3,1,3,3,1} (avg 2.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (pipeline large but arrivals have been delayed historically). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand samples (100,69,92,77,111) show no clear sustained mean shift, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances higher effective lead time (capture delayed deliveries) while keeping demand forecast anchored to historical samples.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1/3 pattern -> average 2). Demand samples (100,69,92,77,111) show mean=89.8; with L\u22482 use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean to reflect 3-period coverage and avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty. Volatility relatively low; use default sigma_hat to scale with \u221a(1+L). This balances service level (reduce lost sales) vs holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Demand samples available seed demand stats; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes base_stock consistent with historical demand while accounting for the review+lead period. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost and the known delayed-shipment history.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=139, in-transit=220. History shows multiple delayed/missing arrivals but concluded lead times observed = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2] (avg\u22482.125), so I let the backend compute an empiric lead time average. Demand sample mean=89.8 (samples:100,69,92,77,111); I use default demand/volatility aggregation across all samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) chosen by the backend. This keeps parameters data-driven: adjusting L to observed delays raises the (1+L) coverage and increases target base-stock (important given high profit $19 vs holding $1 to avoid stockouts), while default mu/sigma use full history to avoid overreacting to short spikes.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=66, in-transit=300. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W = {3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2}, avg\u22482.1) and earlier sustained missing shipments (Periods 1\u20133). I choose L=calculate so the backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures recent variability vs promised=2). For demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(samples) respectively using all historical demand samples; this balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit stock (300) and modest on-hand (66). No new explicit forecast or volatility override is warranted.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent demand has been moderate with historical samples (100,69,92,77,111). On-hand=3 and in-transit=367 (large pipeline outstanding). There were past sustained missing shipments (Periods 1\u20133) but subsequent concludes show mixed lead times. I choose L.method="calculate" to let the backend use the average of all observed lead times (captures the mixed/unstable deliveries).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical concluded lead times yield avg=2.0 (evidence in conclude messages across periods), and recent demand shows volatility but no sustained regime shift. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to base forecast on all samples (conservative given mixed recent spikes and dips). This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost by not overreacting to short-lived demand spikes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=361. Recent demand has been variable with occasional spikes (e.g., P15=142) but no new sustained regime shift (latest arrivals include mixed lead times). Past missing-shipment episodes are known but no new confirmed loss pattern. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses observed concluded lead times to estimate actual lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so demand forecast uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (using observed lead-time history) against holding cost without overreacting to short-lived spikes.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed values include 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,1) so I use the empirical average lead time to capture recent variability. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine calibrates base-stock and cap with the full sample set while accounting for inferred L. This balances service (large pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=454. Recent demand has stepped up: last 6 demand samples (Periods 13\u201318) = [73,63,142,108,148,109], indicating a higher recent mean (~107.5) vs earlier history. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times including confirmed 2-period average; earlier missing shipments occurred but later arrivals resumed. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures variable/confirmed avg). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained higher-demand regime. For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These settings raise target base stock to meet the higher recent demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior to mitigate prior missing-shipment risk.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded lead-times remain variable but were summarized previously as avg=2 (confirmed at Period 12); recent periods show arrivals interspersed with zeros but no new sustained lead-time shift or demand regime change (insufficient consecutive evidence >3 periods). In-transit inventory (503) already provides large pipeline cover vs. typical period demand; to avoid overreacting to intermittent missing arrivals, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its sample-based base-stock calculation. Therefore select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed samples avg \u22482.09) and earlier sustained missing shipments (Periods 1\u20133). Large pipeline suggests shipments are en route but arrival timing is uncertain. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses empirical average (captures recent 1\u20133\u2013variable lead times). For demand, I use default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because recent demand (samples: 100,69,92,77,111) shows no sustained regime shift; defaults balance service level and holding cost while letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using observed lead-time estimate. This approach hedges against delayed arrivals while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concludes show inconsistent but overall average lead time > promised (observed lead times list avg \u22482.18) and multiple lost/delayed shipments earlier; pipeline is large so be cautious but maintain backend awareness of longer effective lead time. I select L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average from concluded messages. Demand recently increased (last 5 demands: 148,109,62,102,107; mean=105.6) vs earlier samples \u2014 use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the current regime and capture the higher recent mean across the review+lead period. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to preserve service given delayed/larger lead times while relying on observed recent demand to limit excess holding costs.

Given observable variability, let backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals.

Demand history is limited and no sustained demand regime shift detected, so use default demand estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base stock and caps using standard sample stats.

LLM Rationale:
Period_26 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier and a confirmed average lead time ~2 at Period_12; to be robust I let the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded messages (method=calculate). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325 = 107,105,107,104,125) is higher than some earlier samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and volatility; this will scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std to keep pipeline sized for (L+1) periods of demand while limiting excessive holding cost given high holding penalty relative to profit.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: recent demand samples average ~100\u2013115 per period with volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Observed concluded lead times have varied (mix of 1\u20133), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend sets (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples; this balances service level given variable lead time while avoiding manual over/under-adjustment despite many overdue arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals since Period 10: orders placed in Periods 10\u201327 produced zero arrivals in their conclude messages (18 consecutive periods) \u2014 indicates likely lost shipments or severe sustained delivery delay.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with many prolonged missing arrivals since Period_10\u2192Period_28 indicating lost/delayed shipments; recent confirmed lead-time evidence (up to Period_17) averages ~2. I will let the backend compute an empirical lead time average from concluded arrivals to reflect observed variability (method=calculate). Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies its calibrated safety-stock formula; this balances service level against $1 holding cost given profit=$19. Explicitly: choose calculated average lead time to adapt to observed mixed lead-time signals while relying on default mu/sigma to leverage all historical demand samples and the backend's cap logic. I note 503 units in-transit may include lost shipments; choosing calculate lets backend average confirmed lead times rather than assuming promised 2.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead times include 3,1,3,3,1,1) and multiple prolonged missing arrivals from Periods 10\u201327 indicating lost/delayed shipments. I let the backend compute an empirical lead time average from observed concluded lead times (method=calculate) so L reflects actual observed delivery behavior. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies full-sample estimates while accounting for the chosen L; this balances service level versus holding cost given significant in-transit inventory and prior delivery instability.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows prolonged missing arrivals since Period 10 (many orders still not concluded), but concluded messages (earlier periods) imply average actual lead time ~2. To be conservative and let the OR engine use observed concluded lead times, set L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples \u2014 this uses all historical demand (Periods 1\u20135 sample set provided) to balance service level against holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows many concluded arrivals with observed lead times averaging ~2 and then a long run of missing arrivals (Periods 10\u201331) indicating lost/delayed shipments; pipeline contains undelivered units but arrivals have not concluded recently. I set L via calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 1/3-period variability without overreacting to missing conclude messages). I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) \u2014 this uses long-run demand evidence (~100\u2013145 per period) and avoids overfitting transient gaps. These choices balance service level (use observed lead-time average) against holding cost by not inflating demand forecasts from noisy recent zero-arrival periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical demand samples mean = (100+69+92+77+111)/5 = 89.8. Multiple prolonged missing arrivals observed in past (Periods 10\u201332 many zero arrivals) but concluded lead times (when observed) average ~2. Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample. This keeps policy simple, leverages observed lead-time estimate, and lets OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded lead times are mixed (observed values ~[3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,1], avg\u22482.18) and there is a long run of missing arrivals after Period 9. I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed variability around 2), and default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (uses observed lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging missing/delayed shipments in the rationale.

Prolonged missing arrivals noted earlier but no new sustained change since prior insights. Use calculated L to reflect observed average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR backend compute demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Demand has been consistently in the ~80\u2013145 range across history; on-hand=0, in-transit=503 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show intermittent lead-time realizations but overall average previously confirmed as 2; many prolonged missing arrivals earlier but no new sustained change since last recorded insights. To let the OR engine use its statistical view (promised L=2) while respecting the large existing pipeline, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples. This keeps orders driven by long-run mean and avoids overreacting to past missing shipments given substantial in-transit inventory, balancing service-level vs holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with many prolonged missing arrivals since Period 10; no new sustained demand regime detected. Use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to capture actual delivery behavior (helps backend size pipeline for longer/variable arrivals). For demand, use default (all-sample) forecasts since only the provided 5-sample demand history is available and there is no confirmed demand shift; sigma use default to reflect sample volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=503 and >25 consecutive periods with no conclude arrivals (sustained delivery failures). Historical concluded lead times include multiple 3-period observations, so I conservatively set lead time higher than promised to guard against further delays. I leave demand forecast and volatility to defaults so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders larger to cover the extended disruption while the backend's cap prevents runaway shipments.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows long runs of missing arrivals but concluded lead-time observations average ~2 periods (use concluded data only). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (matches observed avg ~2). Demand forecast and volatility use default (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine computes base-stock from full historical demand; this balances service level given observed lead-time variability while avoiding overfitting to recent apparent delivery disruptions that may reflect lost shipments rather than demand shifts.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows many prolonged missing arrivals since Period_10 and mixed observed lead times (samples from concluded messages yield avg ~2.18). I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures realized variability vs promised 2). Demand history for model is limited to the provided samples (mean ~89.8); I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to the historical demand while letting L reflect observed delivery performance; it balances service level (by increasing pipeline coverage if L>promised) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical conclude messages show intermittent arrivals and confirmed average lead time ~2 (Period_12). Many periods (10\u201343) had zero new orders/arrivals suggesting prolonged missing shipments, but we currently have 503 units in-transit to arrive in future concludes. Use calculated lead time based on observed concludes to capture actual shipping behavior; use default demand/volatility (all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across available demand history. This balances service level (using observed lead-time) against holding cost given current large pipeline; flags: 503 units in-transit likely cover multiple periods, avoid over-ordering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: demand history shows ongoing customer demand but long run of non-arrivals since Period 10 with in-transit=503 and on-hand=0 \u2014 indicates many outstanding/overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times (earlier periods) average ~2. Use L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average rather than promised; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable forecast despite missing arrivals. This balances service (accounting for observed lead time) vs holding cost given current large in-transit volume and high profit margin.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows prolonged missing arrivals since Period 10 but earlier concluded arrivals give observed lead times (multiple 1\u20133 periods). No new sustained demand regime. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed concluded lead times (~2.18) so the OR engine accounts for realized delays; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' to leverage all historical demand samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because no confirmed recent demand shift meets the 3+ period sustained threshold. This balances service (accounting for longer observed LT) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Recent history shows long run of zero concluded arrivals since Period 10, but previously lead time was confirmed as 2 at Period 12 and earlier arrivals were intermittent. On-hand=0, in-transit=503 (large pipeline). I choose L=default (use promised lead time=2) because historical concluded lead-time evidence is mixed and the backend expects promised L; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the large pipeline while avoiding manual overcorrections for possible lost shipments. These settings balance service level (covering current+lead demand) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent realized demand (seed samples) mean = 89.8 units/period; profit $19 vs holding $1 encourages high service. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=503 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals are only observed in conclude messages, so some in-transit may still be delayed/lost. Observed lead times history yields average ~2.0 (use calculate). I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat=default to scale (1+L)\xd7overall mean (\u22483\xd789.8=269.4) so base-stock targets multi-period coverage; sigma_hat=default to reflect pooled volatility (\u224826.3 after sqrt(1+L) scaling). These choices balance service (high profit) against holding cost and account for uncertain/delayed arrivals by sizing orders to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical conclude messages show variable but measurable observed lead times (examples: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,1) and many prolonged missing arrivals; to be robust I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). Demand history is noisy but no sustained recent demand regime shift meeting 3+ period threshold; use default (all-sample) demand forecast and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR engine can apply its base-stock formula while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (using observed lead-time average) vs holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. History shows a long-run delivery failure: many orders placed since Period 10 produced no conclude arrivals. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend averages all observed concluded lead times (uses only concluded messages) rather than trusting the promised 2; this adapts to observed variability. For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it balance service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given the computed L and demand stats. This approach flags the prolonged missing arrivals (in-transit may include lost shipments) while leaving numerical demand estimation to the OR engine which has full sample set.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals since Period 10 now extends through Period 49 (40 consecutive periods with no concluded arrivals for orders placed in P10\u2013P49); likely lost shipments or sustained delivery failure.
