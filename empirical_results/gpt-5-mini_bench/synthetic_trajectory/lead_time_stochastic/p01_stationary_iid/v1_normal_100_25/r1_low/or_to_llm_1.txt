Risk assessment: some past orders experienced delays but we have no sustained evidence of lost shipments beyond lead_time=3; holding cost equals profit ($1 each) so excess inventory is costly. OR recommended 0; given confirmed L=3 and pipeline > (L+1)-period demand, I will not order to avoid extra holding cost. Final decision: order 0 units for chips(Regular).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 0 units (agree with OR): confirmed actual lead time = 3 and in-transit 381 units already covers ~4 periods (~360 units) so no replenishment needed.",
