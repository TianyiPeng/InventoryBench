Required coverage target: with promised L=2 we need (L+1)=3 periods \u2248 309 units \u2014 pipeline (372) exceeds this. If actual LT=3 (occasionally observed), target becomes 4 periods \u2248 412 units, leaving a shortfall \u2248 40 units. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and intermittent LT=3 risk, place a small top-up to reduce stockout risk without large holding cost. Final strategy: increase OR's 0 by 40 units to buffer against occasional 3-period lead times and recent higher demand, but avoid large orders because sizable pipeline already exists and arrivals may materialize. Follow-up: monitor upcoming conclude messages to confirm when/if the 372 in-transit arrives and whether LT stabilizes at 2 or 3; adjust future orders accordingly.",

Given that, an order placed in Period 49 would arrive during Period 52 (visible after the game ends), so it cannot satisfy remaining near-term demand. Inventory analysis: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 415 (pipeline exists though ETAs are unobserved here); placing new stock that arrives after horizon only increases potential lost/unused inventory and holding cost beyond the simulation. OR recommended 0 units; I accept this because new arrivals from any order now would be too late to sell before the horizon and holding costs penalize end inventory. Final strategy: place 0 units this period to avoid ordering stock that will not arrive in time and to avoid unnecessary holding cost. Continue to monitor conclude messages next period for actual arrivals and update lead-time / pipeline beliefs.",

Treat actual lead time as 3 periods. Inventory & demand analysis: recent single-period empirical mean from provided samples \u224890 units. With actual L=3, decision should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand = 4\xd790 = 360 units. Current pipeline (in-transit) = 415 units and on-hand = 0, so pipeline + on-hand (415) already exceeds 360; no immediate replenishment needed. Risk notes: some past shipments were delayed/lost but many in-transit arrivals have later materialized, and we have no concluded evidence of these specific in-transit units being lost yet. Ordering now would only increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without increasing units_sold given existing pipeline. Therefore place 0 units order and monitor next conclude for actual arrivals before ordering.",
