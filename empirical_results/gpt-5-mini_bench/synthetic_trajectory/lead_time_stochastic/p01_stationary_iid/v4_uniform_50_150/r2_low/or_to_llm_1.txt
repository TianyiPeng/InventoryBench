Inspecting pipeline: remaining in-transit (503\u2212221=282) corresponds to orders placed P15(122), P17(70), P18(90). P15 is overdue (should have arrived by P17 but did not) and is effectively likely lost; P17 (70) should arrive during Period 19 (after my decision) and will only be visible in Period 20 conclude; P18 (90) would arrive later. Historical single-period mean demand = (130+88+64+58+129)/5 = 93.8 \u2248 94. OR recommends 0 because it trusts full pipeline (503) and uses promised L=2; that would understate effective stock because many shipments are lost. Given immediate on-hand =0 and high single-period demand (~94) I need at least one period's worth to avoid a lost-sales penalty now. Holding cost = profit, so over-ordering yields no expected net gain.
