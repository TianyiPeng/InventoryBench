Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No conclude history to infer actual lead time; promised lead time (2) is used. Historical demand samples (130,88,64,58,129) show no sustained regime shift (only 5 samples, no 3+ period consistent change). To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) I use defaults so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and variance with promised L=2. This avoids overfitting on sparse data and preserves service while controlling inventory.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=151 from Period_1 order which has not concluded (arrived=0) so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Demand history available but no sustained regime change detected. To avoid overreacting to a single missed arrival, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service vs holding given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=296 (orders from P1 and P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2 but no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 not enough consecutive evidence to confirm a lead-time change (need 3+ periods). Demand history (chips(Regular) samples) will be used with promised lead time to let the OR backend compute the base-stock and cap. Using default L and default demand moments keeps the model anchored to full-sample stats while accounting for the 2-period review+lead horizon; this avoids overreacting to apparent delays that may be transient or lost shipments.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=357. Concluded history shows three consecutive periods with zero arrivals for earlier orders (Period1\u2192arrived=0, Period2\u2192arrived=0, Period3\u2192arrived=0), suggesting delayed or lost shipments but not yet a confirmed lead-time > promised. Use default lead time (promised 2) so OR backend retains standard lead-time assumption. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast is (1+L)*mean and volatility sqrt(1+L)*std based on all provided historical samples (chips demand samples provided). This balances service-level targeting by the OR engine while acknowledging there is substantial in-transit inventory (357) to cover upcoming demand; if arrivals remain missing in future concludes, we'll update lead-time inference then.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133: three consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for those orders, indicating possible delayed or lost shipments (evidence: Period1 arrived=0, Period2 arrived=0, Period3 arrived=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $968.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start: on-hand=153, in-transit=168. Historical concludes show mixed lead times: Period1 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=3) and Period3 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=1); Period2 order remains unconfirmed. Demand samples recent: [130,88,64,58,129]. Given observed variability but limited samples, use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let OR adapt to actual behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting to short irregularities. This approach addresses missing/delayed arrivals by letting L reflect observed leads while keeping demand estimates stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1027.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Context: on-hand=94, in-transit=314. Concluded history shows mixed lead times (orders: P1\u2192arrived P4, lead_time=3; P3\u2192arrived P4, lead_time=1) indicating variability but limited samples. I choose L by "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability). Demand shows no clear sustained regime shift (samples: 130,88,64,58,129), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base stock with standard pooling of all data. This balances service level (accounting for observed longer lead_time) against holding cost given current substantial pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1426.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=18, in-transit=367. Recent demand dropped after Period_3 (P4-6 demands = 59,59,76) vs earlier high in P1-3 (95,71,136); evidence of a lower-demand regime so I base forecast on the most recent 3 periods. Observed concluded lead times include 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4) so average lead time \u22482; use backend 'calculate' to reflect observed variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new lower-demand regime and recent volatility, which keeps base-stock responsive while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=344. Recent concluded arrivals show variable but frequently 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) with one 1-period outlier (P3\u2192P4); average of last 3 observed lead times \u22482.33 so I use recent_N for L to capture current longer-than-promised lead behavior. Demand has been volatile with a recent uptick (P5\u2013P7 = 59,76,144); to react to the most recent regime and cover review+lead demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend builds base-stock and caps based on the latest demand profile. This balances higher service risk from delayed arrivals against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4; P4 order arrived P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2774.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=0, in-transit=365. Observed concluded lead times = {P4: ordered P1 -> 3, P4: ordered P3 -> 1, P7: ordered P4 -> 3, P8: ordered P5 -> 3} => average lead time = 2.5. Recent history shows shipments delayed earlier but multiple confirms of 3-period arrivals, so I use the calculated average lead time to reflect mixed evidence. I select default demand/statistics (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine can produce a base-stock that balances high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) while accounting for longer effective pipeline; this keeps service-level protection given substantial in-transit inventory and uncertain arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1353.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent history shows inconsistent arrivals with several delayed shipments but latest evidence averages to ~2.2 periods lead time (observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1). On-hand=91, in-transit=336 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=427 units, which comfortably covers the (1+L) demand forecast (~(1+2.2)\xd7mean_sample \u2248 300 units). To balance service vs holding cost I set L to be the average of observed lead times (captures realized delays) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves responsiveness to the confirmed longer lead times while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1329.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed mixed lead times with recent confirmations of 3-period arrivals (P1->P4,P4->P7,P5->P8) but occasional 1-period arrivals (P3->P4,P8->P9). To capture this recent variability I set L using recent_N with N=5 (average of last 5 observed lead times). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this balances service level (accounts for elevated recent lead-time) against holding cost. Note: history shows delayed/lost shipments earlier and a large in-transit pipeline (385) vs on-hand (20), so using recent lead-time average is conservative.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean=93.8. Concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,3,1 => avg\u22482.2) so I will let the backend compute the empirical average lead time. Use default demand and volatility scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula consistently given the chosen L. This balances service (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1273.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent conclude messages show mostly 3-period arrivals (several P\u2192P+3 observations) with some 1\u20132 period noise; average observed lead time calculated from concluded history is \u22482.29. On-hand=114 and in-transit=258 => pipeline=372 which already covers the (1+L) demand multiple given historical mean demand. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasting anchored to full history while respecting the inferred longer lead time and avoiding unnecessary new orders that increase holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=55, in-transit=323. Historical concluded lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,3,2] \u2192 average \u22482.29, indicating actual lead time slightly above promised 2 and variable. Demand samples (provided) are limited; no sustained demand regime shift detected. To let the OR engine adjust for observed longer lead time, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times. For demand and volatility I'll use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a baseline forecast that broadens safety stock for the longer estimated lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy periods.

To capture the empirically longer lead-time pattern I let backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). I use default demand scaling for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred L.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Recent conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P12\u2192P15) with occasional 1\u20132 period events; average observed lead time \u22482.38. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine uses empirical lead-time evidence. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given updated L and historical demand volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=370. Recent conclude history shows multiple arrivals with lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3} (9 observations) \u2014 majority are 3, average = 22/9 \u2248 2.444. Several earlier periods showed missing arrivals but later confirms indicate actual lead time has trended > promised 2 (dominant 3). Given nonstationary lead-time evidence, set L by averaging observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for longer/mixed lead times. Demand samples available (historical) are limited; use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma, allowing the OR engine to size base-stock with updated L. This balances service (capture longer lead times) against holding cost by increasing review+lead demand coverage without overfitting to recent volatile periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands P13\u2013P17 = 59,125,102,68,122; mean \u224895.2) and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods (repeated observed lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (large pipeline) so set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the latest regime (captures the recent higher mean and volatility). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples; this balances service level against holding cost given high profit and low holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) are: [3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1] (11 observations), avg \u2248 2.45 \u2192 use calculated lead time to reflect actual drift above promised 2. Demand samples (provided) mean=93.8; with L\u22482.45 the backend default mu_hat formula ((1+L)\xd7mean) is appropriate to cover review+lead demand without overreacting to short-term noise. Volatility will use default scaling (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine compute safety stock using observed variability. These choices acknowledge delayed shipments (in-transit large) while letting OR backend compute base-stock and cap; using calculated L aligns pipeline coverage with observed arrivals and reduces stockouts from underestimating lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_20, on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Historical concluded arrivals show many lead_time=3 observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17) but some 1s and a 2; overall average lead time ~2.36. Several earlier shipments were missing/delayed but many later arrivals confirm longer-than-promised lead times. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures the frequent 3-period delays). For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/longer lead times and avoids overfitting to short-run noise. These choices help the OR engine increase pipeline cover when empirical lead time exceeds the promise while letting its base-stock math set order targets.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Historical conclude messages show recurring 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3); several earlier periods had missing same-period arrivals but later concluded as LT=3. Recent demand history (samples and conclude demands) shows high variability with frequent stockouts (demand spikes to ~140+). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=3 signal). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes a base-stock reflecting the full review+lead demand while keeping volatility aggregated; this balances high profit vs low holding cost and leverages the inferred longer lead time to avoid stockouts given the large in-transit quantity and past delays.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) with some 1\u20132 period exceptions; average observed lead time is above the promised 2. To let the OR engine reconcile observed variability while leveraging its historical averaging, I choose L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135: 130,88,64,58,129) are limited but show mean ~93; I rely on default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend scales demand and volatility for the chosen lead time. This balances service (accounting for longer average lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging some shipments were delayed/lost \u2014 using calculated L and default demand stats keeps parameters consistent with observed lead-time behavior and lets the capped ordering rule limit large orders despite pipeline inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Historical concludes show recurring 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) with occasional 1\u20132 period anomalies and earlier missing arrivals. Majority signal confirms actual lead time \u22483; use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift; use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This setup acknowledges longer effective lead time (improves service) while relying on aggregate demand stats to limit excess holding given large pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 18\u201323) = [101,57,148,65,112,53]; I use a lead time L=3 to match observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime with higher variability. This balances service (longer inferred lead time) against holding cost given currently zero on-hand and substantial in-transit stock.

Several concluded messages indicate actual lead times vary and many =3. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures realized variability vs promised 2). I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 conservative given irregular arrivals and no new sustained demand change.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=481 \u2014 large pipeline but prior history shows variable/mostly 3-period lead times with some 1\u20132s and several lost/delayed arrivals earlier. Use L="calculate" so backend infers empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures confirmed 3-period mode while reflecting occasional 1\u20132s). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so demand forecast uses all available samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this is conservative given limited sample set and high pipeline uncertainty. These choices balance service level (accounting for longer empirical lead time) against holding cost by letting OR compute the appropriate base-stock and cap.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Recent conclude history shows many arrivals with mixed lead times (mostly 3, some 1-2); average observed lead time ~2.36. Given variable but multi-period delays and a large pipeline, I use calculated average lead time to capture actual behavior. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost while letting the backend cap orders based on its demand estimates. This also accounts for the need to cover (1+L) periods of demand given the observed lead-time variability and the current on-hand/pipeline position.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical demand samples (seed): [130,88,64,58,129] mean=93.8. Multiple concluded messages confirm frequent 3-period arrivals (evidence in history and prior carry-over insight), so I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained shift. With L=3 I use default demand/volatility rules so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the OR engine aligned with the longer observed lead time while leveraging the full sample set; large in-transit suggests limited immediate ordering needed but using default base-stock inputs lets the backend cap orders appropriately versus holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). Given sustained 3-period lead time and high pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 to reflect reality (promised=2 would understate pipeline). Demand history (samples: 130,88,64,58,129; mean=93.8) used with default aggregation over (1+L) periods: mu_hat default yields (1+3)*mean \u2248 375.2 to cover four-period demand including review+lead. Volatility is set to default so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) (sqrt4*~30.83 \u2248 61.66) to reflect observed variability. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service level given longer lead time while the OR backend caps ordering; they also rely on current large in-transit volume (481) to prevent over-ordering.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical conclude messages show a confirmed lead time of 3 in earlier periods (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and a recent long run of missing arrivals (many orders from P18\u2013P29 concluded with arrived=0). This suggests actual lead time \u22483 and/or lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. Demand parameters use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative aggregate forecast given noisy history. These choices aim to raise target pipeline to cover the extra lead period while letting the backend balance service level vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals from Period 18\u201329: 12 consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in P18\u2013P29, with current in-transit=481 \u2014 indicates probable lost or severely delayed shipments requiring conservative lead-time/pipeline handling.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=481, many consecutive conclude messages from Periods 18\u201329 show arrived=0 indicating probable lost/delayed shipments; historical observed lead times cluster at 3 periods from earlier concluded arrivals. To be conservative and let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time behavior and full-sample demand statistics, I ask the backend to (1) compute lead time from observed conclude messages (calculate) so confirmed 3-period patterns are captured, and (2) use default demand mean/volatility across all samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full historical demand pool ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (capture the multi-period lead-time) against holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty and lost-shipment risk.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concludes show frequent actual lead_time=3 for many orders and a long run of missing arrivals from P18\u2013P29 indicating lost/delayed shipments; backend promised L=2 is unreliable. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures prevalent 3-period behavior). Demand has shifted since P18 (sustained uncovered demand, recent periods 18\u201331 show ~100/unit demand); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (the recent regime length) so forecasts reflect the current higher-demand regime and its volatility. These settings bias orders upward to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand and compensate for delayed/lost arrivals, balancing service level versus holding cost given high profit ($19) relative to holding ($1).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent demand (P18\u2013P32) shows sustained, higher mean (~100\u2013120) with volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=481 but many conclues from P18\u2013P32 show arrived=0 indicating probable lost/delayed shipments. Historical conclues (P4,P7,P12,P15,P16,P17,P18\u2013P32) support actual lead time \u22483 rather than promised 2. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to match observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 demand periods (P18\u2013P32) so the forecast and uncertainty reflect the current high-demand regime and variance; this helps the OR backend raise base stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while acknowledging higher volatility. No explicit numeric overrides so backend applies its formulas with these inputs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 34, on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concludes show repeated delayed/lost arrivals and multiple observed lead times; confirmed earlier evidence of 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Given persistent delivery irregularity but clear instances of 3-period lead time, set lead time explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline covers additional delay. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance profit vs holding cost with the longer L.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201334 = 121,111,109,89,79) averages ~101.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=481 with long run of missing/concluded arrivals from P18\u2013P29 indicating lost/delayed shipments; earlier evidence also confirmed lead_time=3 in prior windows. To be conservative I set lead time explicit=3 (confirmed historically) so the backend sizes pipeline for a 4-period exposure (review+L). For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower regime (most recent 5 periods) and reduce reliance on older pre-gap data. For volatility I use recent_N=5 to capture recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting demand given large in-transit uncertainty while limiting excess holding cost by using recent lower mean.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=481, recent demand (Periods1-5 samples) and long stretch of zero arrivals indicate actual lead times have varied and many shipments were delayed/lost. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average > promised 2, so I let the backend calculate average observed lead time to capture realized delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine ties demand forecast to the chosen L and historical demand variability. This balances higher safety stock when lead time is longer while keeping volatility estimates grounded in full-sample history given no new sustained demand regime change.

Given repeated 3-period arrivals when shipments do arrive and pervasive delayed/lost shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. Use default demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine leverages full-sample estimates while the explicit L captures the confirmed longer lead time and forces larger pipeline targets to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=481. History shows a long run of missing arrivals beginning Period 18 and continuing through Period 37 (no arrivals for orders placed in P18\u2013P37). Earlier evidence confirmed occasional lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7), and the prolonged missing arrivals indicate shipments are delayed/lost; using a longer effective lead time (3) is conservative. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period arrivals and to avoid under-ordering given delayed pipeline. Demand appears to have shifted starting Period 18 (sustained nonzero demand with zero arrivals), so I use recent_N (N=20, covering Periods 18\u201337) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast across the review+lead period based on the most recent regime. These choices increase ordered coverage for upcoming periods while keeping volatility estimated from the recent demand regime so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals extended: Period 18\u201337 show 20 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0 for orders placed in P18\u2013P37; current in-transit=481 \u2014 indicates probable lost or severely delayed shipments requiring conservative lead-time/pipeline handling.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=481. Historical concludes show actual lead times often 3 and many missing arrivals since Period_18\u201337; to be conservative I set lead time = 3. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338 = 79,106,142,67,114) indicates a higher steady mean than the very early samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) to capture current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices increase pipeline cover (1+L periods) and reflect recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=504. History shows many delayed/lost shipments since Period_18 (concludes P18\u2013P39 show arrived=0 for those orders). Multiple earlier arrivals imply actual lead time often =3, but recent long run of zero arrivals suggests lost/severely delayed pipeline. I select L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures the frequent 3-period realizations). For demand I use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" (both use all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) \u2014 conservative aggregate forecast given uncertain arrivals and limited reliable recent sales data. These settings bias orders toward the OR engine's computed base-stock that reflects observed lead-time behavior while keeping demand estimate stable.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals extended: Period 18\u201339 show 22 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0 for orders placed in P18\u2013P39; current in-transit=504 \u2014 indicates probable lost or severely delayed shipments requiring conservative lead-time/pipeline handling.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed lead_times = [3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,1], mean \u22482.25) and many missing arrivals between P18\u2013P39 indicating unreliable shipments. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (capturing the multi-modal/lengthened pattern). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) review+lead period from all samples\u2014this is conservative given the noisy/lost arrivals and preserves standardization for the capped order policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=481 with long run of missing arrivals from P18\u2013P39; historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals earlier (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12). Given persistent lost/delayed shipments, I choose a conservative explicit lead time of 3 (captures observed 3-period arrivals and pads pipeline protection). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all samples scaled by (1+L), balancing service level vs holding cost given high uncertainty and existing in-transit units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=481. History shows earlier confirmed lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and many missing arrivals since P18 (large block of zero-arrival concludes), so promised L=2 is unreliable; use explicit L=3 to reflect observed faster-than-promised but persistent multi-period transit. Demand recently (Periods 38\u201342) averages ~87 units; to adapt to the most recent regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the OR backend builds a (1+L)-period forecast based on current demand trend, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings prioritize covering the next (L+1) periods of demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and high profit=$19, and they are conservative about pipeline shortfalls caused by past missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=481, long run of missing arrivals from P18\u2013P39 indicates unreliable deliveries though historical concluded lead times often =3. To protect service given observed arrivals and long delays, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (last 5 demand observations) rather than long history contaminated by lost shipments. These choices raise pipeline coverage for the longer effective lead time while keeping demand and volatility estimates responsive to recent realized demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=481, profit=$19, holding=$1. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (many W=3 events and several W=1/2) and a long run of missing arrivals since Period 18. I set L method to calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 1\u20133 period behaviour) rather than the promised 2, and I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost while letting the cap limit avoid over-ordering into a likely lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals extended: Period 18\u201343 show 26 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0 for orders placed in P18\u2013P43; in-transit=481 \u2014 indicates probable lost or severely delayed shipments requiring conservative pipeline handling.

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=481 with long run of missing conclude arrivals from Periods 18\u201343 indicating lost/severely delayed shipments despite earlier evidence of 3-period lead times. To be conservative and reflect observed arrivals when they did occur (multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals) set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples; this balances service (use longer lead-time multiplier) vs holding cost given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average rather than promised 2, and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) using the full sample history (conservative basestock reflecting observed variability and the extended effective lead time). This balances service (accounting for longer/uncertain lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=481, long run (P18\u2013P47) of concluded arrived=0 indicates many shipments lost/delayed\u2014do not trust promised L=2. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed occasional 3-period arrivals and to be conservative against further delays. Demand since P18 shows a sustained regime (30 periods) of nonzero demand; use recent_N N=20 to capture the most recent regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N capped at 20 per rules). These choices increase the forecasted pipeline (1+L)\xd7recent mean and variance, raising target base-stock to protect service level despite uncertain arrivals while keeping holding cost in mind because holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent history shows long run of missing arrivals since Period 18 with in-transit=481 and on-hand=0; earlier lead time was confirmed as 3 in prior windows. Given sustained lost/delayed shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (matches confirmed observations) so the OR backend increases pipeline coverage. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples, which balances service level versus holding cost while respecting the longer effective lead time and avoiding overreaction to short-term demand noise.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals extended: Period 18\u201348 show 31 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0 for orders placed in P18\u2013P48; in-transit=481 \u2014 indicates probable lost or severely delayed shipments requiring conservative pipeline handling.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=481, recent history shows prolonged missing arrivals since Period 18 (many orders conclude arrived=0) but earlier concluded lead times concentrate around 3 (with some 1s/2s). I set L to 'calculate' so backend will average observed concluded lead times (captures the historical ~2.25 mean rather than promised 2). Given large uncertain in-transit and no clear recent demand regime break, use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand while letting the backend adjust base-stock for the inferred lead time. This balances service-level (using observed lead-time evidence) against holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty.
