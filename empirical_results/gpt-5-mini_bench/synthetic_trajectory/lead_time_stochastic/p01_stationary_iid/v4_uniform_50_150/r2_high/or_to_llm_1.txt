Promised L=2 appears incorrect; use L_actual=3 for coverage planning. Empirical single-period mean from provided samples = (130+88+64+58+129)/5 = 93.8 \u224894 units. Required coverage = (L_actual + 1) \xd7 mean = 4 \xd7 94 = 376 units to cover current period plus lead-time pipeline. Current pipeline + on-hand = 416 + 0 = 416 units, which exceeds the 376 target by ~40 units. Ordering now would risk unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while existing pipeline should satisfy demand. OR recommended 0 units; I follow that recommendation given sufficient in-transit inventory and confirmed longer lead time. Action: place 0 units.",
