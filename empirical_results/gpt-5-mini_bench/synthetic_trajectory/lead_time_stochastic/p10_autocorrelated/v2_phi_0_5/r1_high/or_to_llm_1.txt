Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=547. Historical sample mean demand = (75+138+134+122+111)/5 = 116 units/period. Using the conservative cover rule (L+1) periods demand with promised L=2 \u2192 (2+1)*116 = 348; using actual confirmed longer lead time (3) would give (3+1)*116 = 464. In-transit 547 > 464, so pipeline is large enough to cover multiple periods of demand even if actual lead time is 3. Risks: there is documented risk of lost/delayed shipments since Period 18, but current in-transit volume is sizable; ordering now risks additional holding cost ($1/unit/period) and potential overstock while awaiting uncertain arrivals. OR recommendation = 0 (capped policy) aligns with the inventory/pipeline check. Decision: place 0 orders to avoid unnecessary holding cost given sufficient pipeline coverage. Will monitor concluded arrivals next periods to detect lost shipments or need to react.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR (0 units): in-transit 547 units exceed four-period demand (~464), so no new order needed despite past shipment risk.",
