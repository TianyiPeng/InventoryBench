Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unknown; use promised lead time. Historical demand samples mean = 116 units (Periods 1-5). With promised L and limited history, choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This preserves the backend's statistical base-stock while the system collects arrival evidence; high profit-to-holding ratio (4:1) favors service, so defaults avoid premature inventory cutting.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=158 (order placed P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; possible shipment still in-transit. Historical demand samples (chips Regular) show no sustained regime change. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies its standard base-stock with full-sample mean/std. This balances service vs holding cost conservatively given uncertainty about arrivals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand ~116. Total on-hand=0, in-transit=311 (orders from P1/P2 haven't concluded yet). No concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use default promised lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances high profit (profit/holding = 4) with holding cost using the OR engine's service-level mapping.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=359, and no concluded arrivals yet (Period_3 conclude shows arrived=0). Promised lead time used because there is no concluded evidence of a lead-time change or lost shipments. Demand history available (all 5 samples) will be used by default statistics. To keep backend supply-safe given zero on-hand and large pipeline, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $499.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrivals in Period 4 reveal heterogeneous actual lead times: an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3), and an order placed in Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). The order from Period 2 (153) has not concluded and is overdue or possibly lost. Promised L=2 may not hold consistently, so I ask the backend to compute L by averaging observed lead times (method: calculate). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect the full review+lead demand based on all 5 historical samples (mean=116). Sigma_hat uses the default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)) to reflect observed variability. These choices balance service (by letting the OR engine adapt L from observed arrivals) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory (153) and on-hand (65); overdue/lost shipments are flagged in rationale so backend can account via its capped ordering rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=306. Concluded arrivals show two observed lead times: P1\u2192P4 = 3 periods and P3\u2192P4 = 1 period (avg=2). Promised L=2 but lead times are variable; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history available across periods; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Current pipeline (306) appears sufficient to cover upcoming (1+L) periods of demand, so no explicit increase to mu_hat is needed now.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_7. On-hand=0, in-transit=456. Historical concluded lead times observed: one order (P1\u2192P4) had lead_time=3, another (P3\u2192P4) had lead_time=1 \u2014 mixed evidence. Several recent orders (P2,P5,P6) remain unresolved in concludes. Given limited, non\u2010sustained lead-time shifts, use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand samples available for Periods 1\u20135; no clear demand regime change, so use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively) so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock computation while accounting for the inferred lead-time behavior. This approach is conservative given overdue shipments: it avoids overreacting to a single long arrival while letting backend balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. Observed concluded lead times: orders from P1 arrived in P4 (LT=3) and from P3 arrived in P4 (LT=1) -> mixed actual lead times. Recent concluded demands (P3-P7): 84,141,107,105,75 (mean=102.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (pipeline large). To balance service vs holding cost, set L to calculated average of observed lead times so backend can reconcile promised vs observed variability; use a recent demand window (last 5 concluded periods) to reflect the current regime including the recent high in P4. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while acknowledging pipeline stock and possible delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5): [75,138,134,122,111], mean=116. On-hand=90, in-transit=303 (total pipeline 393). Observed concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3 periods) but average ~2. To reflect observed lead-time variability I set L=calculate so backend uses average observed lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; with L average \u22482 this produces a 3-period demand forecast that balances service (covers current+lead periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio. No shipments appear lost; pipeline (393) comfortably covers several periods of demand, so no aggressive upweighting of mu_hat is required.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed over 4 observed arrivals: Period4 arrivals -> ordered P1 lead_time=3, ordered P3 lead_time=1; Period8 arrivals -> ordered P5 lead_time=3, ordered P7 lead_time=1; average observed lead_time = 2.0 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=2, in-transit=364. Historical demand samples mean = (75+138+134+122+111)/5 = 116. Total pipeline is large so avoid aggressive up-weighting of recent demand. Four concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3,1,3,1 \u2192 average 2.0 periods. Choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level given the large in-transit inventory and equal observed lead time to the promised value.

To reflect observed lead-time behavior and keep backend aligned, set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed average. Demand history available; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost and accounts for the 1+L review+lead coverage requirement.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: recent demand has averaged roughly 96 units/period (observed demands: 90,79,84,141,107,105,75,79,88,61,69). On-hand=0, in-transit=447 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) with average ~2 periods; use calculated average lead time so backend aligns with observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set \u2014 this leverages all data while letting L reflect observed lead-time behavior. This balances service (high pipeline + increased effective lead time) against holding cost by relying on the OR engine's safety-stock formula rather than forcing extra explicit inventory.

Daily Profit: $532.00, Daily Holding Cost: $11.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $521.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent concluded history shows mixed lead times (1 and 3) but average observed lead_time = 2 (matches promised). Recent demand history (samples: 75,138,134,122,111) has mean 116 units/period. On-hand = 11, in-transit = 303 \u2192 pipeline is large relative to typical demand (\u2248116), so no urgent upward correction needed. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (2), and use default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to mixed-but-centered lead-time observations.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with average observed lead_time = 2.0 periods (use calculate to let backend adopt observed average). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical demand samples (conservative pooling) to compute base-stock and cap given the chosen L. Current pipeline (326) comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand, so no aggressive up-weighting of mean or variance is needed. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or lost shipment beyond prior observations.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=453 (large pipeline). Historical demand samples avg=116 units/period (samples: 75,138,134,122,111). Several concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) so I let the backend calculate average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Given the large in-transit volume, use default demand/volatility rules ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula while the cap limits excess ordering. This balances service (profit$4 vs holding$1) while acknowledging observed lead-time variability and existing pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent realized arrivals show variable lead times but average ~2.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=455 (large pipeline). Use calculated L to let backend infer observed average lead time from concluded arrivals history. Demand samples (historical seed) show moderate mean; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend computes base-stock consistent with observed demand and chosen L. This keeps orders aligned with pipeline volume while balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1). No explicit adjustment for lost shipments\u2014calculate L lets backend adapt to observed lead-time evidence.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 decision. Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed arrivals with 1 and 3 periods, average ~2). On-hand=0, in-transit=434 (large pipeline). To reflect observed lead-time variability I ask backend to compute L from observed arrivals (method=calculate). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full sample history while letting OR engine scale for the inferred lead time. This keeps orders conservative given sizable in-transit stock and potential lost/delayed shipments: backend will cap orders vs. pipeline and balance profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $491.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent demand has been elevated (~Periods12-17 avg \u2248131) with current on-hand=5 and large in-transit=343. Observed concluded lead-times (multiple P arrivals) imply mean lead_time \u22482. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I let the engine compute L from observed arrivals (calculate). I set demand estimates using the most recent regime (last 6 periods) to capture the sustained higher demand (recent_N, N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap against the current high-demand regime and large pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=502. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with average = 2. Demand has trended up recently (last 5 concluded demands avg \u2248131.6 vs longer-run mean \u2248116). To reflect confirmed lead-time behavior use calculated average lead time; to capture recent demand increase use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base_stock for the (1+L) review+lead window and higher recent mean/volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by limiting adjustments to the most recent regime.

Recent demand has risen vs earlier samples; use the last 5 periods (P16\u2013P20) to capture the current regime: recent mean demand \u2248124 units; with (1+L) periods this yields a higher replenishment target and sigma based on recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (profit $4 vs hold $1) while reflecting observed lead-time variability and avoiding understock from the recent higher-demand regime.

Demand has moderated recently (~Periods17-21 mean \u2248110); use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting near-term demand with the large in-transit pipeline while keeping safety stock responsive to the latest demand pattern.

Several past orders experienced 1 or 3 period arrivals but average =2 and no new sustained shift (recent missing arrives but pipeline abundant). To avoid overreacting and because pipeline already covers multiple periods of demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level given high in-transit against holding cost.

Demand history (Periods 1-5 samples) is limited but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, ensuring orders target coverage for (L+1) periods and balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history mean (Periods 1-5) =116; with L\u22482 the default mu_hat (=(1+L)\xd7mean) is appropriate and conservative given no recent sustained demand regime change. sigma_hat use default to reflect historical variability scaled by review+lead. Profit/holding (4/1) implies a high target service level, so defaults with observed L keep service while avoiding extra explicit overstock given large in-transit.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) averaging 2; use lead-time inference rather than promised. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which yields a conservative base-stock covering (L+1) periods of demand given current pipeline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=558 \u2014 large pipeline but recent concludes show variable lead times (1,2,3) with average near 2. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses empirical average (captures 1/3/2/3 patterns). Demand history (periods 1\u201327) shows no sustained shift beyond normal variability; therefore use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (using observed longer average lead time) against holding cost given already-large in-transit stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Recent concluded history shows multiple arrivals with mixed lead times (1 and 3) whose average = 2. Given substantial pipeline and confirmed lead-time variability, set L using observed average so backend uses actual lead-time signal. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples) to keep forecast anchored to historical demand while letting OR engine compute safety stock. This balances service (accounting for longer average lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Demand history shows no clear sustained recent regime shift (high variability across periods), so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility. These choices let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) using the empirically inferred lead time while avoiding overreacting to noisy recent swings or possible lost-but-unconfirmed shipments.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: recent demand history (Periods 1-5 samples mean=116) shows typical weekly demand ~110-140. On-hand=0, in-transit=558 \u2014 large pipeline but no recent concludes since Period_30, suggesting either long/variable lead times or delayed shipments; however prior observed arrivals (4 samples) gave average lead_time=2.0. To be conservative and align with observed lead times, set L by calculation (use observed average). Use default demand scaling (1+L)*mean of all samples for mu_hat and default sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute safety stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (use observed L=2) while avoiding overreacting to recent arrival gaps which could be lost shipments.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Recent realized demand has fallen vs early history (last 5 periods demands: 43,10,89,71,57 -> avg ~54). Prior carry-over confirmed average observed lead time ~2 \u2014 no new sustained lead-time change. With a large pipeline I keep promised lead time to let backend use L=2, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding. This balances service (pipeline already large) against holding cost by lowering the forecasted (1+L) demand and reducing safety stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Historical arrivals show average observed lead_time ~2.0 (matches promised), but recent demand has declined sharply since Period_24 (highs 155\u2192 recent samples much lower). To be responsive to the recent low-demand regime while acknowledging confirmed lead-time behavior, set L by calculating observed lead times; set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 24\u201332, 9 samples) so the OR engine targets a smaller base-stock and reduces holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

Multiple concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample lead times: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,1 \u2192 avg \u22482.22), indicating actual lead time > promised sometimes. Use L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, yielding base-stock consistent with observed demand and inferred lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this leverages all demand data to set base-stock while the large in-transit pipeline already provides coverage. This avoids overreacting to transient arrival variability and balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples\u2014this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting short-term noise. The large in-transit volume (558) likely covers multiple periods of demand, so conservative defaults avoid excess additional ordering while backend caps orders appropriately.

Demand forecasting uses 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of provided samples) and volatility 'default' so the OR engine computes base-stock and cap with consistent statistics.

Use explicit L=2 to align forecast window with observed arrivals. Pipeline (558) is large relative to recent demand history, so use default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples; this avoids overreacting to recent noise while honoring observed lead-time. Default sigma lets backend scale variability with (1+L). These choices balance service (capturing confirmed L=2) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent history shows variable lead times with confirmed observed average \u22482.0 over four concluded arrivals; on-hand = 0, in-transit = 558 (large pipeline). To reflect the empirically observed lead-time variability I request L by "calculate" (backend will average observed lead times). Demand forecast and volatility will use all available demand samples so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat with "default" (i.e., (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample demand while letting L capture actual lead-time experience so orders + pipeline cover the (L+1) demand periods and the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

I choose L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility use default (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because there is no new sustained demand regime change; defaults provide a balanced base-stock target given profit=4 and holding=1 and the large pipeline already in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=0, in-transit=558 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but average observed lead time = 2.0 across recorded arrivals \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples, ensuring base-stock covers the review+lead horizon and balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Observed concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but average observed lead time = 2.0 across arrivals \u2014 use calculate to let backend adopt observed lead time. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the calculated L accounts for realized lead-time variability and ensures pipeline + order coverage for (L+1) periods given large in-transit stock.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=558 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple periods but arrivals are delayed historically. Observed lead times (from concluded messages) average 2.0 periods (evidence in history), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend use that empirical average. Demand history shows no recent sustained new regime beyond earlier samples, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed average = 2.0 across multiple arrivals). I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u201325 sample series provided) will be converted to (1+L)\xd7mean by using default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base stock and cap from full-sample stats. This choice accounts for confirmed lead-time variability while leaving demand estimation to the backend's full-sample defaults given no recent sustained demand regime shift. Large in-transit inventory suggests upcoming arrivals will cover demand; using calculate for L helps avoid over-ordering if actual lead time is near observed average.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: recent concluded history shows observed lead times averaging 2.0 periods (see prior arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=558 units which already comfortably exceeds a 1+L demand coverage at expected demand levels. Profit/Holding => q=4/(4+1)=0.8 (high service priority). I choose to let the backend compute L from observed arrivals (calculate) so it uses confirmed lead-time variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This yields conservative stocking given high profit and large existing pipeline while letting OR engine cap orders appropriately and avoid unnecessary holding costs.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Promised lead time=2 but concluded arrivals (Periods 4,8,12,17) average to 2.0 \u2014 no strong recent demand regime shift visible from provided samples. Pipeline is large (558) so use inferred average lead time to align review+lead forecasting while letting backend compute base stock from full-sample stats. Chosen L=calculate to use observed lead-time average; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend apply (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, keeping service focus given high pipeline and profit/holding balance.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49. On-hand=0, in-transit=558 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) averaging ~2.0; no sustained demand regime change since many later periods had zero arrivals. To reflect observed lead-time variability I set L by calculating the average observed lead times. Use default demand and volatility estimation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this leverages full history while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgency to inflate forecasts. This balances service (using inferred L=2) versus holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=558. Recent concluded history (up to Period 9) shows variable lead times averaging ~2.0 periods; many subsequent periods show no arrivals despite in-transit volume so we remain cautious. I select L='calculate' so the backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level (profit vs holding) using full demand history given the uncertain arrival pattern.
