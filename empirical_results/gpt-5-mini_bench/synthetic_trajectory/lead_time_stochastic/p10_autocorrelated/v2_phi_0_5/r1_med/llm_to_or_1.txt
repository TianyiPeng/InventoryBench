Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No 'conclude' messages yet so no evidence of lead-time or demand regime change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all provided samples to let OR backend compute base-stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=158 (order placed P1) and Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2192 no concluded lead-time evidence yet (cannot infer actual lead time). Historical demand samples mean=116 units/period. Using promised lead time (default) keeps alignment with contract and lets OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample stats. mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so backend will scale demand and volatility by (1+L), preserving service-level tradeoff while accounting for current in-transit inventory. This addresses the outstanding P1 shipment (treat as in-transit) and avoids overreacting to a single missed arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=315 (orders from P1=158,P2=157) and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time=2 but actual lead time not yet observed. Historical demand samples mean=116 units/period; using default methods keeps OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Choosing default L uses promised lead time (2). mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean leverages full-sample mean to cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std uses full-sample volatility. This is conservative given overdue but unconfirmed arrivals; if arrivals fail to conclude in future periods, switch to explicit/recent_N for L.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical demand samples mean=116 (samples: 75,138,134,122,111). Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded as arrived by their expected arrival windows, indicating delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative, set lead time explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. Use default demand/volatility methods so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this raises target base-stock to protect service level given missing arrivals while relying on full-sample demand stats (no clear demand regime change).

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived by their expected windows (no arrivals concluded), suggesting persistent delivery delay or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $280.00, Daily Holding Cost: $149.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_5. Recent concludes show mixed actual lead times (Period1\u2192Period4 = 3, Period3\u2192Period4 = 1) and missing/late arrivals (Period2 order still not concluded). On-hand=149, in-transit=265. To balance service vs holding cost I set L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR engine adapt to realized variability (method: calculate). Demand forecast uses default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all 5 samples) to leverage full historical demand (stable sample mean=116) and avoid overreacting to short-term noise; sigma_hat uses default population scaling to reflect overall observed volatility. These choices hedge against delayed/lost shipments by increasing the effective review+lead demand coverage without over-inflating safety stock from very recent noisy samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent realized demand samples (Periods 1-5) avg=116 units/period. On-hand=80, in-transit=320 (pipeline=400) \u2014 pipeline large relative to demand; earlier periods showed delayed arrivals but concluded arrivals give observed lead times of 3 and 1 (avg=2). Given mixed evidence (some delays but average matches promised) I set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times so backend can use empirical avg. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are applied consistently to all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline and demand history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical demand samples mean=116 (n=5) with recent demands showing variability (75\u2013138). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (one LT=3 from P1\u2192P4, one LT=1 from P3\u2192P4) so I use calculate to average observed lead times to capture actual behavior without overfitting to a single arrival. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L from calculate this gives a multi-period forecast that leverages all data. This balances service level (uses observed longer LT) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory (376 units) and no on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: recent history shows variable but elevated demand (historical samples mean=116 units). Observed concluded lead times: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1, P4->P7 = 3 (avg observed \u22482.33). On-hand=0, in-transit=356 (large pipeline). Due to confirmed multi-period delays (some arrivals showing LT=3) I set L to be the average of observed lead times so the OR backend accounts for longer effective lead time. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the larger L and the current large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_9. On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead times observed: 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7), 3 (P5->P8), 1 (P7->P8) \u2014 recent pattern skews to longer deliveries (many 3-periods). Demand recent 5 periods (P4\u2013P8) averaged \u2248108.4, showing elevated demand versus earlier. To protect service given delayed arrivals, set lead time using recent observed lead times (recent_N, N=5). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime and volatility so the backend computes base_stock covering (1+L) periods and the cap appropriately. This balances higher service level due to delayed/lossy shipments against holding cost given in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8)

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand samples mean=116; using default mu_hat with L allows backend to scale (1+L)\xd7mean across all data for robust baseline. Use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices maintain service while limiting extra holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=487. Recent demand has shifted up since Period 6 (periods 6-10 = 127,124,152,165,152) vs earlier lower samples. Observed concluded lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,1], average = 2 so I use global average for L to let backend reconcile mixed signals. For demand I detect a recent higher-demand regime (Periods 6-10, length=5) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to protect service during sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock reflecting recent variability. This also accounts for the large in-transit volume when backend computes final order.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=569. History shows mixed but recent lead times vary (1 and 3); demand has trended up around Periods 7-10 then dipped in P11. Profit/holding implies high target service level (q=0.8) so preserve coverage for (1+L) review+lead window. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent mix of observed lead times (gives an average ~1.8 periods). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base the forecast on the last 5 demand observations (captures the recent elevated demand around P7\u2013P10). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (avoid lost sales given large in-transit uncertainty) while letting the OR engine cap orders per its cap calculation.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: recent demand has been variable with a short spike around Periods 8\u201310 but reverted\u2014no sustained demand regime change detected. On-hand=177, in-transit=295; some past shipments were delayed but recent concludes confirm multiple 3-period lead time observations. I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period pattern while accounting for occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively \u2014 conservative choice given lack of a sustained demand shift. This increases pipeline cover for the slightly longer inferred lead time, improving service while avoiding aggressive extra safety stock since holding cost is nontrivial.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision. Recent concluded lead times average \u22482.125 (observed series: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2) so I use 'calculate' to let backend set L based on observed data. Demand history (samples mean=116, std \u224825) implies (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248362.5; current on-hand+in-transit=377 roughly covers that forecast, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap. This balances service (cover multi-period demand under variable lead times) versus holding cost while accounting for the confirmed irregular lead-time pattern.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 context: on-hand=68, in-transit=296. Historical conclude messages show multiple observed lead times (3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3) indicating actual lead time is often \u22653; some 1\u20132s exist but several 3s and recent arrivals (P9->P12, P11->P14) support longer delays. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures realized variability and recent 3-period pattern). For demand, use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) based on provided historical demand samples (mean=116) \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given longer inferred lead times. Sigma_hat='default' lets backend scale std by sqrt(1+L) to reflect increased uncertainty over the longer review+lead period. This combination addresses missing/delayed shipments by increasing pipeline cover while relying on overall sample mean to avoid overreacting to short spikes.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=388. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages): 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3 (avg \u22482.22). Several shipments were delayed or took 3 periods frequently, but there is variability. Use lead-time estimate computed from observed data (calculate) so backend averages actual observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this balances service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit pipeline and observed lead-time variability. This addresses possible missing/delayed shipments by letting the backend increase the review+lead demand coverage accordingly.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=458, recent demand elevated (Periods 12-16: 97,95,96,124,141). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14). To protect service given delayed/lost shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime (mean of last 5 periods \u2248110.6; (1+L)=4 \u2192 target demand across review+lead). This raises order targets to cover upcoming 4-period demand and keeps safety stock responsive to recent volatility while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=325. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but persistently delayed lead times (observed 11 arrivals since P4). I set L to "calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures the mix of 1\u20133 period delays). Demand samples (75,138,134,122,111) are limited and show mean=116; I choose mu_hat "default" so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) to scale forecast across review+lead period. Volatility is left to backend with sigma_hat "default" (sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)). This balances service (accounts for longer observed lead times) while avoiding explicit overstock given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as persistently variable with mean \u22482.18 periods (11 observed arrivals since P4); 6 of 11 observed arrivals had 3-period delays, indicating frequent 3-period lead times.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=475. Historical concluded lead times (last 11 observed): [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,1] -> variable but skewed to 3. Recent demand (Periods 14-18) = [96,124,141,169,146], mean=135.2 (elevated). Many overdue/lost shipments earlier but recent arrivals confirm multi-period (often 3) lead times. Choose L=recent_N (N=11) to capture actual variable lead-time distribution. Set mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base order-up-to on the most recent elevated demand (covers review+lead). Set sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices increase safety stock to protect service given frequent 3-period delays while using recent demand to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=536; recent history shows variable lead times with mean \u22482.18 and frequent 3-period delays (11 observed arrivals since P4). Demand has shifted upward vs the initial small sample; I use an L estimated from observed lead times (calculate) to capture the true delivery behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the latest 5 demand observations (captures current higher demand regime). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the (1+L) review+lead forecast and recent volatility, which increases the base stock to protect service given delayed/variable arrivals while avoiding excess long-term holding since holding cost is non-trivial.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=547. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (11 observed: mean \u22482.18, frequent 3-period delays). Recent demand has risen vs early-sample set; last 5 observed demands (P16\u2013P20) = [141,169,146,119,118], mean\u2248139. To account for actual lead-time variability use the data-driven average (let OR engine compute average observed lead time). For demand and volatility use the most recent regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent demand and short-term variability; this balances service (protect vs late arrivals) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 22, on-hand=0, in-transit=547. Historical concludes show variable lead times with many 3-period arrivals and an overall mean >2; however this is already recorded in carry-over. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed arrivals to estimate actual average lead time from concluded history. Demand historically (samples provided) shows no clear recent sustained regime shift that meets the 3+ period threshold, so use default demand and volatility computations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time. This keeps orders responsive to the backend's statistical estimate while accounting for the observed delayed arrivals via the calculated L.

Observed lead times in concluded history are variable (mean \u22482.18, frequent 3-period delays), so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed arrivals (method: calculate) to capture actual delay patterns. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all respectively; this ties the order-up-to to the inferred lead time while keeping demand pooling across available samples.

Default demand/volatility scaling is appropriate while letting the backend use its (1+L) scaling once L is set to the observed-average. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures persistent multi-period delays). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead times and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. History shows variable but persistently >2 lead times (carry-over mean \u22482.18); many 3-period delays and intermittent lost arrivals. I set L explicit=2.18 to reflect observed mean actual lead time so the OR backend orders for a longer effective pipeline. Recent demand (Periods 22-26 = 94,103,80,109,116) shows a stable recent regime; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, focusing on latest demand behavior. This balances service (longer L reduces stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost by using recent demand estimates rather than inflating demand from older samples.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=536 => large pipeline but no visible arrivals this period; history shows frequent 3-period delays and variable lead times (carry-over already records mean\u22482.18). To capture actual lead-time uncertainty use calculated average lead time from observed conclusions. Demand history is noisy; use default demand & volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. These choices let the OR engine inflate base-stock for the inferred longer/variable lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times with frequent 3-period delays (carry-over records). Large in-transit stock reduces urgency to inflate orders, but actual lead time variability suggests using an empirically inferred L. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times average (captures the documented ~2.18 mean and frequent 3-period delays). Demand appears stable-to-rising versus the initial seed samples; to be responsive to recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) so the base-stock forecast and safety stock reflect the latest demand regime while avoiding over-reacting to single-period spikes. This balances service level (accounting for longer/variable lead time and recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_30. On-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concludes show variable lead times with many 3-period arrivals; carry-over already records mean\u22482.18. I let backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) to capture persistent variability. Demand recently is elevated (last 5 periods demands: 109,116,137,150,113 \u2192 mean\u2248125); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat so (1+L)\xd7recent mean is applied. Volatility should reflect the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N=5. This balances higher recent demand against holding cost by tying forecasts to the most recent regime while letting L reflect confirmed lead-time variability.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical conclues show actual lead time is variable with mean \u22482.18 and frequent 3-period delays (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Because lead time has materially drifted from the promised 2 and many concluded arrivals exist, set L by averaging observed lead times so the OR engine uses the empirically confirmed lead-time. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend combines the full historical demand signal with the inferred L; this balances service level (given long/variable lead times) against holding cost while the large in-transit position will be reconciled by the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

LLM Rationale:
Period_32. On-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times with many 3-period delays and a recent mean \u22482.18 (carry-over). To let backend use observed lead-time history I choose L.method="calculate" (avg of observed lead times). Recent demand (Periods 27\u201331 = 137,150,113,96,114) shows a slightly elevated and variable regime; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 demands, which balances responsiveness to the recent regime while accounting for pipeline in-transit stock and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33. On-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical arrivals show variable lead times with frequent 3-period delays; therefore let L be computed from observed lead-times (backend can average observed arrivals). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile; use the most recent 5 demand periods to capture current regime for both demand mean and volatility. This balances service (keep orders sized for recent higher demand) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Demand recent window (Periods 29\u201333) is stable near ~110 units. To capture true lead-time behavior use calculated average from observed arrivals (let backend infer mean lead time). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the latest demand regime (~110 units) and avoid being skewed by early high-variance samples. This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead times) against holding cost by basing base_stock on recent demand and observed lead-time average. No explicit correction for possibly lost shipments because arrival history will let backend compute L via 'calculate'.

To let the backend infer the empirical lead-time distribution from concluded arrivals, I select L=calculate. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples (leveraging full history) \u2014 this balances service level given variable lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent zero-inventory stretches. No explicit inflation of demand forecast because recent long stockouts make short-run sample means unreliable; letting backend use all samples is more stable.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical demand (seed samples P1\u2013P5 mean=116) and long run history show confirmed variable lead times with mean \u22482.18 and frequent 3-period delays. Pipeline is large (536) so do not inflate demand forecast; instead set L to reflect observed lead-time average and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples. This balances service (accounting for longer, variable LT) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and avoids over-ordering when many units are already inbound.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical arrivals show persistent, variable lead times with prior analysis confirming mean \u22482.18 periods and frequent 3-period delays; multiple earlier orders were delayed or lost. To account for the observed longer/variable lead time I set L explicitly to 2.18 so the backend computes demand across the correct multi-period pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, ensuring safety stock and order caps are scaled using the inferred longer lead time while leveraging full sample history. No new sustained pattern beyond previously recorded lead-time variability.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concludes show lead time persistently variable with mean \u22482.18 (multiple confirmed 3-period delays); overdue shipments earlier imply using a longer-than-promised lead time. I set L explicitly to 2.18 to capture the observed average delivery delay. Demand in the most recent five concluded periods (P37\u2013P41: 123,152,134,109,132) averages 130; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat so the (1+L) review+lead demand reflects the latest regime. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service given longer effective lead time while avoiding overstock from older, lower-demand regimes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with mean > promised (carry-over notes mean \u22482.18); several past periods had long/3-period delays and earlier missing shipments. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures actual \u22482.18). Demand history for the SKU is limited to the provided samples, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base-stock consistent with observed demand and the inferred lead time. This balances service (higher L increases mu_hat safety stock) vs. holding cost given large in-transit pipeline; on-hand is zero so replenishment should cover (L+1) periods of demand but avoid excess by relying on observed lead-time average.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent variable lead times with mean \u22482.18 and frequent 3-period delays; many orders previously delayed or lost. To reflect observed longer/variable delivery while keeping OR backend demand-driven, I set L explicitly to 2.18. Demand in recent periods has been higher than early-sample means, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (last 5 demand observations). These choices raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) versus holding cost given limited remaining horizon.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concludes show variable lead times with confirmed mean \u22482.18 (sustained across many arrivals) and frequent 3-period delays; large in-transit pipeline likely contains many outstanding late shipments. I set L explicitly to 2.18 to reflect the observed actual lead-time distribution rather than the promised 2. This makes the backend compute (1+L)-period demand targets using that lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/volatility scaled by (1+L); this balances service level given high in-transit inventory while avoiding overstock from uncertain arrivals.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical concludes show variable lead times with many 3-period delays; use calculated average lead time to capture this. I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed arrivals to set average lead time (\u22482.18 from history). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while letting the OR engine incorporate full historical demand variability. High in-transit suggests upcoming arrivals may cover several periods; using calculated L helps reconcile expected arrivals with pipeline and reduces risk of under/over-ordering given variable lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Recent history shows long run of zero on-hand with sustained positive demand (many periods of 80\u2013166). On-hand=0, in-transit=536 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past orders showed variable/long lead times (frequent 3-period delays). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average observed lead times (captures the persistent >2-period reality). For demand I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while relying on full-sample demand stats given no recent regime change evidence. This approach acknowledges delayed arrivals via calculated L and keeps demand estimates conservative.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=536. Historical conclues show variable actual lead times (many 3-period delays; carry-over notes mean \u22482.18). Given persistent variability in arrivals but a large pipeline (536 units) I ask the OR backend to infer average observed lead time (calculate) so ordering reflects actual fulfillment delays. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively (backend will apply full sample history). This balances service (accounting for longer effective L) against holding cost since pipeline already supplies near-term need.

Use lead-time inference from concluded arrivals (calculate) so backend averages observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L).

To reflect observed reality rather than the promised 2, set L via calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Demand historical samples are limited in the environment snapshot; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) given the inferred lead time and observed demand dispersion. This choice keeps parameters consistent with the confirmed variable lead time and leverages full-sample demand statistics while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.
