OR recommends 88 using promised lead time and historical demand; however OR cannot see the large in-transit pipeline. Strategy: Do not order now (order=0). Rationale: the 354 units in-transit, if they arrive, will cover multiple periods (reducing stockout risk) and ordering now risks creating excessive holding costs if the in-transit shipment still arrives. Given high profit/low holding cost, OR leans toward replenishment, but the immediate priority is to wait one more period to observe whether the overdue 354 arrives (we'll learn this in the next conclude).
