{
  "rationale": "Observed evidence: concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (carry-over insight). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=441. Recent realized demand (Periods 46\u201349) averages \u2248150 units/period. If lead_time is 3, we must cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand before new order arrivals are visible: target coverage \u22484 \xd7 150 = 600 units. Pipeline + on-hand = 441, so shortfall \u2248159 units. Ordering 160 units closes the gap while keeping inventory growth moderate (holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit). This increases service probability vs OR's 0 recommendation which used promised L=2 and historical averaging; I override to reflect observed longer lead time and recent higher demand. No other sustained pattern changes to record now.",
