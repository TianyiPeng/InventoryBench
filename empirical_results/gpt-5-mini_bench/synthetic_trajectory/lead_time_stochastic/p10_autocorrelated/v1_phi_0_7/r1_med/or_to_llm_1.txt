Current state: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 411 units. With L=3, an order placed now (Period 44) would arrive during Period 47 and only be available for demand in Period 47 onward. Demand outlook: recent realized demands when stocked average ~100 units/period; even using a conservative mean of 100, remaining periods (45\u201350) = 6 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248 600. However many historical periods show lower demand too; OR recommended 0 because it uses promised L and historical averages; its cap is driven down by pipeline. Inventory economics: holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to profit $4/unit; carrying large ending inventory across multiple remaining periods will erode profit. With 411 units already in-transit, we should avoid ordering now to prevent excess holding cost and possible leftover inventory at the horizon. Risk assessment: pipeline 411 is likely insufficient to meet all remaining demand, but any order now arrives too late to affect demand in Periods 45\u201346 and will incur holding cost for remaining periods; marginal benefit of ordering now is small compared to immediate holding penalties. Decision: follow OR (order 0) to avoid overstock and holding-cost losses given large in-transit volume and late arrival timing.
