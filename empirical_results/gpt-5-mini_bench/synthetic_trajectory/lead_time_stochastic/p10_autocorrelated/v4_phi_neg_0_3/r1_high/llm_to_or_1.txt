Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean = (74+108+88+98+134)/5 = 100.4. Use promised lead time (default L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this balances service level against holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=138 from Period_1 order which has not concluded (no observed lead-time). No evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 3*100.4 = 301.2 to cover review+lead demand based on full history. Use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) versus holding cost given high profit relative to holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=272, no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed (promised L=2). Use default lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Demand history available but no clear changepoint; use default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves service level given large pipeline while avoiding overreaction to unresolved shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded by their promised arrival windows (promised L=2): P1 order did not arrive by Period_3 conclude; P2 and P3 also show no arrivals yet. This suggests actual lead time is longer than promised or some shipments are lost. To be conservative and ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicitly to 3 (one period longer than promised). Demand forecasting uses default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap with the increased review+lead period. This increases ordered coverage to protect against delayed arrivals while relying on historical demand stats for central tendency and variance.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 beyond the promised 2-period lead time; evidence suggests lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1605.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. On-hand=124, in-transit=269. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W=3 for P1->P4 and W=1 for P3->P4); average observed lead time = 2, so use calculate to let backend set L accordingly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, respectively, preserving full-sample demand signal while the lead-time estimate is clarified. This keeps a balanced service level (covers review+lead demand) without overreacting to short noisy lead-time samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision with on-hand=48 and in-transit=352. History shows mixed observed lead times (Period4 conclude: P1\u2192P4 lead_time=3, P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1) implying variable delivery timing but average around 2. Several recent concludes show some orders arriving late or not arriving on promised schedule. I choose L via "calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures reported variability). For demand and volatility I use the defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages all available demand history while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead aggregation. This balances service (by reflecting longer observed lead times) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and recent arrivals variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demands volatile (98,83,136,91,76,115). On-hand=0, in-transit=419 \u2014 large pipeline likely from prior orders; some past shipments were delayed (P1\u2192P4 had lead_time=3). I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures actual variability). Demand forecast and volatility use 'default' so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this balances service vs holding given large pipeline and uncertain lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $905.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_8. Observed concluded arrivals show variable but now consistently multi-period lead times: observed lead times = 3 (P1\u2192P4), 1 (P3\u2192P4), 3 (P4\u2192P7) \u2192 average \u22482.33. On-hand=83, in-transit=336 (large pipeline). Given multiple confirmations of 3-period arrivals and some 1-period noise, I set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained, >=3-period regime shift in demand, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute the base-stock while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service level (protecting against multi-period lead time) vs holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period4 order arrived in Period7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1742.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=120, in-transit=248. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period4 order arrived in Period7). Given confirmed LT=3, I set L explicitly to 3. I use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) which scales historical demand stats for the longer replenishment horizon. This increases target pipeline to cover 4 periods of demand and reduces risk of stockouts given delayed arrivals while keeping parameters grounded in the full sample history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period4 order arrived in Period7)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1773.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed: 3,1,3,3,1,1 -> average 2.0). On-hand=70, in-transit=296 (large pipeline). Demand history (periods 1-5) mean ~100.4. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (2) so the OR backend accounts for actual delivery behavior. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are applied, leveraging full-sample stats while the large in-transit reduces urgency to over-order. This balances service level (captures multi-period demand) against holding costs given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=372. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) indicating actual lead time longer than promised; recent periods include some 1-day arrivals but the sustained evidence supports L=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time and ensure pipeline covers extra delay. Demand samples (Periods1-5 mean=100.4) are limited and show no clear sustained mean shift, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This increases order coverage for service level given delayed/lost shipments while relying on historical demand stats to limit overstock.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7) and intermittent 1-period arrivals; several earlier orders were delayed or lost causing late inventory spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained evidence of 3-period lead time; mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR engine computes demand over the review+lead period using all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This biases orders to cover a 4-period demand window, reducing stockouts given delayed arrivals while letting the backend balance service vs holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent concludes confirm most arrivals follow a 3-period lead time (multiple P1\u2192P4 and P4\u2192P7 observations) and several earlier delayed/lost arrivals. Current on-hand=21, in-transit=286 (large pipeline). To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and sizable pipeline, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default) and default volatility (sigma_hat default) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full sample history while the explicit L ensures orders cover the longer replenishment horizon and limits understock risk despite overdue shipments.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand samples (74,108,88,98,134) show mean ~100.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=427 \u2014 large pipeline likely includes multiple outstanding orders (some previously delayed to ~3-period lead time). Given multiple concluded observations showing lead times of 3 (and some variability), I use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level (via base-stock) against holding cost while accounting for the inferred longer average lead time. No new missing-shipment pattern added here.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical concluded lead-times show a persistent 3-period mode (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P11\u2192P14) with occasional 1\u20132 period outliers; pipeline is large so avoid underestimating L. I set L using recent_N (N=5) to bias toward the recent 3-period regime. No clear, sustained demand mean/variance shift in the sample series, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap; this balances service-level (capture 3-period lead risk) versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed persistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15). On-hand=0, in-transit=434. To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand pattern, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent demand regime (Periods 11\u201315 demands: 110,150,77,127,103) so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap to cover (1+L) periods under current demand and volatility while accounting for delayed arrivals/missed shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=76, in-transit=403. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent shift to ~3-period lead times in recent arrivals (many observed lead_time=3 for orders placed P9\u2013P13). I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time regime (N=5). Demand has been elevated vs the earliest 5-sample snapshot; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (Periods 12\u201316). These choices let the OR backend size base stock for the current longer effective lead time and recent demand while capping orders per its policy to control holding cost given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2163.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=79, in-transit=289. Historical concludes show repeated 3-period arrivals (many orders with lead_time=3) and earlier missing arrivals, so actual lead time is persistently longer than the promised 2. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed operational lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use the backend default ( (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples ) so mu_hat scales with L and historical mean (samples: 74,108,88,98,134). Sigma_hat uses the backend default to scale variance with sqrt(1+L). These choices increase pipeline cover for the extra lead time and reduce stockouts given observed delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine compute safety stock consistent with profit vs holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent demand has been high and variable (last 5 demands: P14\u2013P18 = 127,103,65,118,133; mean\u2248109). On-hand=0, in-transit=398 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.), so I treat lead time as 3. I set L explicit=3 to align the OR model with observed 3-period delivery reality. For demand forecast I use a recent_N=5 window to capture the current regime (1+L=4 review+lead periods \xd7 recent mean), giving the backend a near-term-focused mu_hat. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (higher base stock via recent higher mean and longer confirmed lead time) while the large in-transit quantity tempers immediate ordering.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20. Recent concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=527 (large pipeline). Several earlier orders arrived later than promised or were delayed, so I treat lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples using L=3; this provides a conservative base-stock over the full lead+review horizon while letting the backend cap orders to limit overordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=527 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed by L=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to capture the confirmed longer lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, increasing order coverage for the longer lead time while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,7,12,14,16,17 etc.) consistently show actual lead time = 3 for multiple orders (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16), and several earlier promised-2 arrivals were delayed or lost. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the correct pipeline, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples, aligning demand coverage with the explicit longer lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages show many orders arriving with lead_time=3 repeatedly (Period4,7,8,12,14,15,16,17), mixed with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; average of observed lead times is ~2.25. To capture persistent longer-than-promised shipments while letting backend compute base_stock with observed average, set L using calculate (average observed lead times). Use default demand/statistics aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances higher safety stock for longer/more variable lead time while relying on full sample demand evidence.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_24: recent history shows confirmed lead time = 3 (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=527 (covers future demand under L=3). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed, sustained 3-period lead time and avoid under-ordering due to promised L=2. Demand has stabilized recently around ~104 units (periods 19\u201323 mean=104.4); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime and compute demand over the review+lead horizon (1+L=4). I use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend to target a base-stock appropriate for the 4-period demand horizon under confirmed longer lead time, balancing service (profit is high) against holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages show many arrivals with lead_time=3 (multiple confirmations) though some 1s/2s exist; recent long gaps and prior confirmed evidence support treating actual lead time as different from promised. I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixture of 1/2/3 observations). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples \u2014 this leverages full history while letting the averaged lead time scale the review+lead demand. This balances service level (using observed lead-time evidence via calculate) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory (527) and current zero on-hand; default demand stats avoid overfitting to short-term volatility or recent zeros which could be shipment-related.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=527 \u2014 sufficient to cover multiple periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed lead time and avoid underordering due to promised L=2 being incorrect. I use default demand/volatility scaling so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); with L=3 the pipeline (527) comfortably exceeds the resulting (1+L)-period demand forecast, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=527, recent history shows repeated arrivals with lead_time=3 (confirmed in prior concludes). Demand samples average ~100+ with variability. Many past shipments experienced 3-period lead time; use calculated L to reflect observed lead times so pipeline coverage accounts for longer transit. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L) scaled mean and sqrt(1+L) scaled std) so the OR backend incorporates the longer effective review+lead horizon while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.) indicating actual lead time > promised 2. Pipeline (527) likely covers several future periods but arrival timing uncertain; to let the OR backend infer the realized lead time from concluded history, I request L using calculated average of observed lead times. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility so the backend applies its base-stock formula consistently with the inferred L. This balances service level (by adopting backend's demand aggregate over the review+lead period) against holding cost given the large current pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16), so use calculated average lead time to capture that shift from the promised 2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given the chosen L; this balances service level (captures longer lead time) against holding cost while leveraging full historical demand data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed arrivals at W=3) though some W=1/2 exist; average observed lead time \u22482.31. Many consecutive periods (11\u201330) had no arrivals despite orders, suggesting lost/delayed shipments but recent concluded evidence supports longer lead time. I select L='calculate' so backend uses average observed lead times (captures the mix of 3s and occasional 1s/2s). Demand across 30 periods has mean ~99.8; I'll use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L. This balances service level (accounting for empirically longer lead times) against holding cost while letting OR engine apply its capped policy given observed variability and the large in-transit quantity.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals Period11\u201330: many consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 despite orders, indicating possible lost shipments or longer-than-observed lead times; current in-transit=527 units (needs monitoring).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32. On-hand=0, in-transit=527 units; historical concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals with some 1\u20132s \u2014 average of observed lead times = 2.25. Several periods (11\u201331) show prolonged zero arrivals (possible lost shipments) so be conservative on lead-time estimate. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the empirical average lead time (captures observed 3-period pattern). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples, letting OR engine combine service-level target with holding cost. This balances higher safety stock needed for longer inferred lead time vs. holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. History shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3) and many prolonged missing arrivals earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=527 so pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed/lumpy. To reflect observed lead time I set L explicit=3. Demand has shifted above the initial small-sample baseline so I use recent data to forecast: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent regime and keep orders responsive given delayed arrivals and high pipeline. These choices reduce understock risk under the longer lead time while keeping the OR engine's cap constraint responsive to recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical concludes show actual lead time=3 periods repeatedly and many missing arrivals earlier; some in-transit may still arrive but shipments have been unreliable. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed observed lead time (addresses lost/delayed shipments by lengthening pipeline horizon). Demand recently has been around ~120 units; to focus forecast on the most recent regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 demand samples, concentrating safety stock on current demand volatility while limiting overstating long-term variability.

To reflect observed lead-time regime I set L='calculate' so backend uses averaged observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order size; this balances higher required pipeline for longer lead time while keeping holding cost penalized by the backend formulas.

Period 37. Recent history shows prolonged missing arrivals earlier (Periods 11\u201330) but multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead times around 3 periods (several P->P+3 arrivals) with some variability; latest conclude shows a 2-period arrival (Period34->36). On-hand=0, in-transit=527 (large pipeline). To let the OR engine infer the effective lead time from observed arrivals while keeping demand estimates simple and robust, set L to calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this uses full demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples provided) and scales appropriately for the inferred lead time. This approach balances service level (by letting averaged L drive longer coverage) against holding cost given the large existing pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show arrivals lagging the promised 2-period lead time, with multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7) and many missing arrivals earlier\u2014this warrants treating lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Demand since Period 11 has shifted to a higher regime (many periods of ~120\u2013150); I use recent_N=5 to capture the current demand level and volatility for the review+lead period. Choices: L explicit=3 to match observed lead-time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to set (1+L)*mean over latest 5 demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase pipeline cover for the longer observed lead time and raise safety stock to balance high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=607. History shows many delayed/lost shipments but concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with multiple confirmations of 3 and some 2s; overall average lead time should be used to reflect this variability. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed lead times (~2.23) rather than the promised 2. For demand, no sustained regime change detected in recent samples (last 5 demands show fluctuation but not a sustained shift), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base stock while accounting for the calculated lead time. This balances service level (accounting for observed longer lead times) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. History shows variable actual lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12) plus occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals recently (P34\u2192P36 lead=2, P38\u2192P39 lead=1). There have also been long stretches of missing concludes indicating lost/delayed shipments. I choose L.method='calculate' so the backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures multi-modal/shifted lead times). For demand I select mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of available demand history, allowing the base-stock computation to reflect the inferred L while leveraging full-sample demand statistics to balance service level vs holding cost amid arrival uncertainty.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=527. History shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead-time arrivals earlier and many prolonged missing arrivals; recent individual arrivals show 1\u20132 but shipment losses continue. To be conservative and cover delayed/lost shipments, set L explicitly to 3 (matches earlier confirmed regime). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample history; this balances higher safety stock for the longer effective lead time while keeping volatility estimation simple given noisy/lost arrivals.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, etc.). Many late-period arrivals and prolonged gaps suggest promised L=2 is wrong for this supplier; use L=3 explicitly. Demand has risen compared with the very early samples; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Set L using explicit estimate 3 to align pipeline timing with observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand average across the review+lead period and keep orders responsive to current demand (~recent mean ~117). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing. These choices align pipeline coverage with observed 3-period arrivals and adapt mean/volatility to the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding over-reliance on much older low-demand samples.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=573. History of concluded arrivals shows variable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) with multiple delayed/lost shipments earlier; recent concluded lead-times (most recent observations across concl messages) average longer than promised. I select L via recent_N to reflect recent realized lead-time behavior (captures recent delays). Demand has been elevated and more volatile in later periods (many demands ~115\u2013150); I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand regime from the most recent 5 demand observations. These choices increase the forecasted review+lead demand and its uncertainty so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service level against delayed arrivals while controlling excessive holding by using only the recent window.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=573. Historical concluded lead-times are mixed (observed 1\u20133 periods) with earlier sustained missing arrivals (Periods 11\u201330). To be conservative about service, let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history (method=calculate). Demand recently (Periods 39\u201343) averages ~105 units over 5 periods; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast reflects the latest regime and avoids contamination from the long zero-arrival window. This balances service (captures recent demand) vs holding cost by limiting the lookback to recent stable observations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=573. History shows repeated actual lead_time=3 (many concl: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and long stretches of missing arrivals; shipments currently in-transit likely subject to 3-period lead time or partial losses. To ensure pipeline covers demand during review+lead, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative pooling given mixed historical regimes). This supports a higher base-stock to protect service levels given observed multi-period delays while keeping backend caps intact to limit excessive orders.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times contain many 3-period observations; average of observed lead times ~2.25, so I use calculate to let backend infer actual lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain but elevated lead time.

To reflect observed reality I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine uses the empirical average lead time. For demand I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to long-run demand while the calculated L increases cover for delayed arrivals and the pipeline. This balances service (larger base stock when lead time is higher) against holding cost given the high in-transit volume.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48. On-hand=0, in-transit=527; many concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period delays (examples: orders placed P1->arrived P4, P4->P7, P11->P14, P42->P45). Recent pattern and prior carry-over evidence point to an effective lead time of 3 periods (promised=2 but arrivals repeatedly at +3). To ensure pipeline covers the longer effective lead time and avoid stockouts given high pipeline and historically >100 period demands, I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, letting the backend produce a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost using the estimated longer lead time.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=527; history shows multiple concluded arrivals with consistent 3-period lead times and many delayed/missing shipments earlier. Pipeline is large but uncertain due to past lost shipments; to hedge I will let the backend infer empirical lead time from observed concludes. Demand has trended higher than the initial 5-sample seed; use a recent-window demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime while keeping variance estimated from the same recent window. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (~2.2 observed); mu_hat='recent_N' N=5 to reflect recent demand level across the review+lead period; sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (capturing longer observed lead time) against holding cost by using a short recent demand window rather than inflating forecast from all historical low samples.

On-hand=0, in-transit=527 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been delayed historically. To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and outstanding pipeline, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples; this keeps forecasts grounded in full-sample stats while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and reduces risk of under-ordering.
