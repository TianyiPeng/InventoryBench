Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change from the limited history. Use promised lead time and population moments to let OR backend compute base-stock: set L=default so lead time = promised 2; use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (samples mean=54.8). This balances service against holding cost given no detected changepoints and zero pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=162 (order placed Period_1) and no arrivals have concluded yet \u2014 cannot confirm lead-time change or loss from a single missing arrival. Use promised lead time to let OR backend apply its assumed L=2. Demand history (Periods 1-5 samples) will be used in aggregate to set replenishment: choose default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), respectively. This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for additional conclude messages to detect any real lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Promised lead time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=345 (orders from prior periods exist but concluded arrivals for those orders are not yet observable for lead-time confirmation). Historical demand samples (all available) have mean=54.8 units; no sustained changepoint or seasonal signal detected. I therefore use the promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level using the full history while avoiding premature adjustments given missing arrival confirmations.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=429 (orders from P1-P3). Concluded history shows no arrivals for orders placed in P1-P3 (arrived=0), so promised L=2 appears to be underestimating delivery delay. I set L explicit=3 to conservatively cover delayed arrivals. Demand history (58,163,41,0,12) is limited and noisy; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples with the chosen L, balancing service level against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed on Periods 1-3 have not arrived by their promised lead time (promised L=2); suggests actual lead time >2 or lost/delayed shipments (evidence: P1-P3 conclude all show arrived=0 for those orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4214.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: on-hand=23, in-transit=279. History shows mixed actual lead times: observed lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4) and lead_time=1 (P3\u2192P4); several early orders missed promised arrivals, so actual lead time is variable. To balance service and holding cost I set L to the average of observed lead times (lets the OR backend account for observed variability). Demand shows no sustained regime shift (samples: 58,163,41,0,12) so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples). This keeps targets responsive to the full sample while letting the backend cap orders to avoid excessive inventory given holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=499. Recent concludes show variable actual lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4, W=1 for P3\u2192P4) and a delayed arrival pattern for later orders (P5 conclude: arrived=0). Demand has stepped up in recent periods (Periods 3-5 demands = 87, 223, 138) indicating a regime shift to higher demand. To balance service and holding cost: set L to be calculated from observed lead times (let backend average observed W values). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 3 periods' demand history), so the base-stock reflects current demand spike while sigma uses short-run volatility for safety against delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand has been higher and more variable (Periods 4-6 demand = 223, 138, 151). On-hand=0, in-transit=762 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P1\u2192P4 = 3, P3\u2192P4 = 1 \u2192 use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (Periods 4-6) so the OR backend sizes base_stock for the current higher-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and substantial in-transit) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent concluded arrivals show variable but elevated lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3). On-hand=76, in-transit=738 \u2014 pipeline is large but past orders showed delayed arrivals and at least two 3-period lead times. I choose L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (captures realized delays vs promised 2). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples; this is conservative given pipeline size and uncertain lead-time. This balances service (higher L raises base_stock) against holding cost by relying on data-driven L and default demand moments rather than overreacting to recent noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1952.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9: on-hand=252, in-transit=446. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) indicating actual lead time > promised. Demand recent history (Periods 4-8 = 223,138,151,20,116) reflects the current regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the confirmed longer lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast across the review+lead horizon using the most recent demand regime and its volatility, which balances higher service needs from longer lead time against holding cost given substantial on-hand+pipeline coverage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8), so actual lead time is confirmed at 3. Current on-hand=241 and in-transit=508 (sufficient pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) capturing long-run demand (uses historical samples provided). sigma_hat set to default to reflect observed volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align OR base-stock with the confirmed longer lead time while avoiding overreaction to recent low-demand noise.

Current on-hand=167, in-transit=508 (pipeline total=675) which comfortably covers a (1+L)-period demand forecast. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use default demand/volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; with large pipeline inventory, this avoids unnecessary extra ordering while preserving service level given profit vs holding cost tradeoff.

Current on-hand=144, in-transit=508 (total pipeline=652) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand under a 3-period lead (1+3=4). To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); with ample pipeline this avoids over-ordering while the backend\u2019s service-level calc (q\u22480.95) is respected. No evidence of a new demand regime or volatility shift, so defaults are appropriate.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 start: on-hand=38, in-transit=446. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period actual lead time (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12). Pending pipeline is large (446) so do not inflate demand forecast; use population-wide stats. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time and ensure the OR backend plans across the correct review+lead horizon. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, which balances service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and avoids overreacting to recent variability while pipeline clears.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=555. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (evidence: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12), so actual lead time is longer than promised. Set L explicitly to 3 to capture observed arrival lag. Demand has recently been variable but last 5 periods (P9\u2013P13 demands 11,74,23,168,109) reflect the current regime; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime. This raises target base-stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time while sizing safety stock to recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=555 \u2014 significant pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed by 3. To reflect confirmed lead-time I set L=calculate so backend uses observed lead times average (captures confirmed 3). Demand shows no clear sustained regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given the longer lead time and current large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=577. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12); recent shipments consistently arrive after 3 periods, so use explicit L=3. Demand has recently been higher and more variable (Periods 11-15 demands = 23,168,109,43,53); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the latest regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase forward cover for the longer confirmed lead time while sizing safety stock to recent demand patterns and limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=468. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time \u22483 (multiple orders observed with 3-period delay), and several 1-period arrivals; I choose to let the backend compute an average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (calculate). Demand has varied but no sustained recent regime shift (sales have alternated between stockouts and normal sales), so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine combine all samples. This balances service (by reflecting observed longer lead times) against holding cost by not overreacting to short-term spikes.

Use calculated lead time to reflect observed LT>promised. Recent demand has been moderate-high (most recent 5 demands: 109,43,53,109,95); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and risk reflect the current regime and keep pipeline coverage = (1+L) periods. This reduces stockouts given delayed shipments while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving with W=3 since Period 4, most recent sequence P9->P12, P13->P16). Recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 43,53,109,95,123) appears a new regime with mean ~84.6. To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand regime I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times, and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. These parameters prioritize service (higher base stock for L=~3) while keeping volatility measured from the same recent window.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

Several earlier promised arrivals at L=2 were delayed, indicating shipments take 3 periods rather than promised 2. Decision: set L explicit=3 to match observed lead time so the OR engine sizes pipeline for the true delay. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to full historical demand while the explicit L corrects for delayed arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_21. On-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16). Demand recent window (Periods16-20) = [109,95,123,114,119], mean=112. I set L to be data-driven (average observed lead times) to capture the confirmed shift from promised L=2 to actual ~3. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest regime (most relevant to upcoming replenishment over review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand level while avoiding over-weighting early, obsolete samples. In-transit 564 units will be counted by backend as pipeline; using recent demand ensures orders balance service level vs holding cost given longer L and high in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (additional observed arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16).

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent across multiple observed orders through Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=564 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers several review+lead periods. To reflect confirmed longer lead time and recent demand level, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest demand regime (Periods 17-21 show sustained ~100-125 demand), which keeps base-stock responsive while the large pipeline limits aggressive ordering and reduces holding cost risk.

I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand has shown a new regime since early periods and recent realized demands are more relevant, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent data; this balances service (capturing recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and confirmed longer lead time.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16), and several late arrivals/lost shipments earlier justify using L=3. With profit=19 and holding=1, use default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (longer confirmed lead time requires larger (1+L) demand coverage) against holding cost; relying on backend defaults avoids overfitting to recent zeros given mixed arrivals and preserves capacity to absorb in-transit stock (564 units).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly. On-hand=0, in-transit=564 \u2014 with L=3 the review+lead horizon is 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 20-24) = [119,101,109,116,72], mean \u2248105.4; 4-period demand \u2248421.6, so pipeline is sufficient but risk of stockouts if shipments are lost. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base forecast on the most recent stable demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters guide the OR engine to target ~4-period coverage tuned to current demand while avoiding excessive holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Large in-transit suggests existing pipeline will cover several periods; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and reduces risk of under-ordering given lost/delayed shipments evidence.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=564. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time ~3 periods (consistent with prior carry-overs). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine forecasts over the correct review+lead horizon. Recent demand (Periods 22-26 = 109,116,72,109,80) shows a stable higher-demand regime vs early sparse samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most relevant recent periods. This produces (1+L)-scaled demand and volatility over the 4-period coverage, balancing higher service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1) while avoiding over-reliance on old low-demand data. The large in-transit (564) will be accounted for by the backend when computing order quantity.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times clustering at 3 periods (multiple confirmed P->P+3 arrivals across history) though some 1-period arrivals exist; average observed lead time is ~2.43 but majority mass is 3. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=564 (pipeline large). To reflect sustained longer lead time evidence while letting backend compute precise average from observations, set L via calculate. Demand since Period 4 has been stable around ~80\u2013120; to capture recent regime and smooth noise I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 samples. These choices align safety stock with the longer realized lead time and recent demand variability while avoiding overreaction to early volatile samples and accounting for the large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time \u22483 (multiple P->P+3 confirmations), and many earlier promised L=2 shipments arrived with 3-period lag. Demand recent window (Periods 24-28 = 72,109,80,91,107) indicates a stable recent mean ~91.8. To reflect confirmed longer lead time and recent demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans for a 4-period coverage (1+L). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the most recent demand regime; this balances service level (capturing higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=564 (large pipeline). To align OR with observed reality I set L explicit=3 so backend computes review+lead demand over 4 periods. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L); this leverages full demand history while the explicit L corrects for the longer lead time and avoids under-ordering given the overdue/larger pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 31. On-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical concludes repeatedly show orders arriving with a 3-period lag (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) \u2014 actual lead time is stably 3. Recent demand (Periods 14\u201330, 17 samples) shows a sustained regime around ~75\u2013123 units. To align the OR engine with observed reality and the recent demand regime, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent stable regime, balancing service level (capture current demand) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations across history). On-hand=0, in-transit=564 (pipeline substantial). Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to capture confirmed LT=3. Demand has a sustained higher-regime since ~Period 6 (roughly 26 periods); use recent_N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable demand regime and reduce influence of early low samples. Use recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet service with confirmed longer LT while controlling holding cost using recent regime statistics.

On-hand=0, in-transit=564 \u2014 substantial pipeline already exists but arrivals reflect LT\u22483 not promised 2. I choose L="calculate" so the backend uses observed lead-time data to set L (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand forecast I select mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L), balancing service level and holding cost given the longer lead time and existing pipeline.

To ensure pipeline covers current + lead periods, set L explicit=3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages full history while the explicit L corrects for delayed arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Many intervening periods showed no arrivals suggesting either longer lead times or intermittent lost shipments, but evidence through concluded arrivals supports L=3. I choose to let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) so the OR engine uses realized lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and substantial pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent demand (Periods 14\u201335) settled around ~100 units/period after early volatile periods; in-transit backlog (564) stems from prior orders that have been concluding with 3-period lead times. Multiple concluded arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, etc.) confirm actual lead time \u22483. Set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed 3). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (20 most recent periods), balancing service level against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use default (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to leverage full history given no recent sustained demand regime change. This balances service (using realized lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Recent demand from Period_14\u2013Period_39 is a stable higher-regime (roughly 70\u2013110 units/period); I select recent_N with N=20 to capture this recent regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20 is the regime length capped at 20). This ensures the OR engine sizes the base stock to cover review+lead demand under the confirmed LT=3 while using recent demand mean/volatility to balance service level versus holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals); many earlier promised L=2 shipments were delayed. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delivery timing so arrivals in-transit are expected 3 periods after order. Demand samples (Periods 1-5 then 12-40) show a stable average near ~100 units; I use default \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given the longer effective lead time. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit volume (564) and the high profit/holding ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect real arrival timing and avoid stockouts. Demand has been in a stable higher regime since Period_6 onward (roughly 70\u2013110 units/period); to capture the recent stable demand and its variability I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This increases service coverage for the longer observed lead time while keeping holding exposure controlled given holding cost = $1 vs profit = $19.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). Pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed by 3 periods, so set lead time to 3. Recent demand (Periods ~23-42) is stable ~75-110; to capture the current regime I use recent sample-based forecasts. Chosen methods: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=20 and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent 20 periods, which balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical conclude messages (P4,P7,P12,P16 etc.) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observed orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16). Because actual lead time is persistently 3 (not the promised 2) I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes orders for the correct pipeline duration. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages the full demand history while the explicit L corrects for the confirmed longer lead time and helps avoid under-ordering given the large in-transit volume and prior delayed arrivals.

Some early promised-L=2 shipments were delayed but later arrivals confirm sustained L=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality so the OR engine sizes pipeline correctly. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples (stable demand history since Period 12), letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and large current in-transit volume.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16), so treat L=3 to account for delayed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand from Period_26\u201345 is stable (~70\u2013118 per period); I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This ensures base_stock covers the (1+L) review+lead window using current-demand behavior while acknowledging in-transit stock and preventing excess holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent sustained pattern). On-hand=0, in-transit=564 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering due to promised L=2. Demand recently stabilized ~80-110 units; to focus the forecast on the most recent regime I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples. This balances service level (capture recent higher steady demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16), indicating actual lead time is 3 (promised=2 but shipments arrive after 3). To ensure pipeline covers the true delay, set L explicit=3 so backend computes demand over review+lead correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (this leverages full history while adjusting for the longer lead time), which balances higher service level (covers extra transit time) against holding cost given holding is low ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical conclude messages show a consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3 across history). Pipeline (564) implies substantial arriving supply but arrivals are only visible after conclude; given repeated confirmed LT=3, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses the empirical avg (\u22483). Demand history since Period 4 is stable ~70\u2013135 units/period (no recent changepoint); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost while relying on observed LT. No new evidence of lost shipments beyond earlier confirmed LT=3.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time \u22483 (many observed W=3 arrivals across history), and several early-period anomalies only; shipments now reliably arrive after ~3 periods. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (capturing the confirmed 3-period reality). Use default demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full historical demand (including steady ~80\u2013120 recent demands) while letting the backend incorporate the inferred L. The large in-transit quantity (564) plus L averaging should prevent immediate stockouts while controlling holding costs.
