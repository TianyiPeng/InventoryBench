{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P40\u2192P43, P41\u2192P44). Inventory & demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=416. Recent demand (Periods 45\u201349) = [105,63,128,105,91], mean \u224898 units/period. With actual L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand \u2192 need \u22484\xd798=392 units. Pipeline (416) already exceeds this requirement, so placing additional order risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) with no profit benefit. OR recommended 0; I agree and place 0 to avoid unnecessary holding given sufficient pipeline and confirmed 3-period lead time. No evidence of lost shipment requiring emergency ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 confirmed actual lead time is 3 and existing in-transit 416 units already covers ~4 periods of current demand (~98/day), so ordering would add unnecessary holding cost.",
