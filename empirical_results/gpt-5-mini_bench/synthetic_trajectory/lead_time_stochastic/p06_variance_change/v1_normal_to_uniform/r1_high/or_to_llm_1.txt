{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows supplier lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier). Orders placed in recent periods are still in-transit and will arrive with 3-period latency (visible one period after arrival). Current inventory state: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 658 units. Timing: We are in Period 29 decision phase; in-transit units include orders placed up through Period 28 and, given L=3, will start arriving during Periods 30\u201331 and be observed in conclude messages thereafter. Demand assessment: Historical realized demand when stocked averaged roughly 100\u2013140 units/period; several recent periods show large unmet demand due to stockouts (periods 23\u201327), indicating true demand is at least as high as pre-stockout levels. Ordering policy logic: Because actual lead time is 3, we must cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand in pipeline+on-hand. Pipeline already holds 658 units which covers ~4\u20136 periods at expected demand rates (658 / ~120 \u2248 5.5 periods). Placing additional orders now risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) and reduced profit per R_t. The OR baseline recommended 0 units; given sizeable in-transit stock that will arrive under confirmed L=3 and uncertain recent demand (partly unobserved due to stockouts), I defer to the OR recommendation and place no new order to avoid overstock and holding cost.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows multiple orders arriving 3 periods after ordering (Period 1\u21924, 4\u21927, 9\u219212, 11\u219214, 13\u219216, 27\u219229, 28\u219230, 31\u219232, 34\u219236). Carry-over insight already records lead time = 3. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=463. Using recent baseline demand (historical sample mean from early snapshot \u224898.2 units/period) and L=2 promised but observed L=3 (so coverage horizon = L+1 = 4 periods), expected demand over 4 periods \u2248 393 units. Pipeline (463) exceeds that requirement, so additional ordering risks excess holding cost. OR recommended 0 units; given strong in-transit coverage and confirmed longer lead time, I follow OR and place no order to avoid overstock/holding cost. Strategy: order 0 to let in-transit arrivals fill expected demand; monitor next conclude messages for actual arrivals (to detect lost shipments) and only order if pipeline falls below ~4\xd7single-period mean or if concluded arrivals show different lead-time/loss patterns.",
