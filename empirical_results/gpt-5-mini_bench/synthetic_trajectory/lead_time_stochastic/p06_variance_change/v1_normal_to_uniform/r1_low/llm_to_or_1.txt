Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No arrivals/concludes observed yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 2 but no evidence to change it. Historical sample mean = (122+121+60+83+105)/5 = 98.2. Using default methods: L=promised (2) and mu_hat=(1+L)*mean covers 3 periods of demand (3*98.2\u2248294.6). sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to capture observed variability. These settings provide the OR engine a standard base-stock reflecting historical demand and the promised lead time, balancing service level vs. holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: observed Period_1 conclude shows ordered=142 still in-transit and demand in Period_1 was 118 (sold=0, on-hand remained 0). Promised lead time is 2 and we have no concluded arrivals to contradict it, so use default lead time to avoid premature adjustments. On-hand+in-transit (0+142) currently covers upcoming demand; keep demand estimate and volatility tied to full-sample defaults so the OR backend computes base-stock using all available demand history. This balances service level (use promised L and full-sample demand mean) against holding cost given holding=profit, avoiding overreacting to a single-period signal.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=285, no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1/P2 still in-transit). Promised lead time=2 remains plausible because arrivals from P1/P2 would conclude later; no sustained evidence of lead-time change. Use default lead time to let OR backend assume promised L=2. Demand history (samples provided) shows no confirmed regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend compute base stock while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=328. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded (arrived=0 in Periods 1-3 conclude). This indicates actual lead time is longer than promised 2 or shipments are lost. To be conservative, set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delays and avoid underordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine size orders with the increased lead-time assumption while preserving its service/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >=3 periods: orders placed on Periods 1-3 have not arrived by Period_3 conclude (arrived=0).

Daily Profit: $117.00, Daily Holding Cost: $68.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=68, in-transit=261. History shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 4 with lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4), so actual lead time appears longer than the promised 2. Several earlier shipments were delayed but some later orders showed shorter arrivals (P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1), so evidence is mixed; however the confirmed 3-period arrival is material for coverage. I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure orders cover the longer observed transit. For demand I use the default aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, keeping the forecast grounded in full-sample history. Sigma uses default to reflect full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This raises target inventory to protect service given observed prolonged transit while letting the OR backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: on-hand=0, in-transit=381. History shows mixed actual lead times (P1->P4 W=3, P3->P4 W=1) and recent arrivals/delays (P5 ordered=120 not yet arrived). Given this variability I let the backend compute an average observed lead time to capture recent heterogeneity (method=calculate). Demand samples (122,121,60,83,105) yield mean\u224898.2; I use default forecasting ((1+L)\xd7mean) so mu_hat is set via default to scale with the chosen L. Volatility likewise left to default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its capped ordering rule while accounting for observed lead-time uncertainty and current large in-transit position.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand samples (P1-5): [122,121,60,83,105] with last observed demands P4-6 showing 83,105,98 indicating moderate variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=443 (large pipeline; several past shipments pending/overdue). Concluded lead times observed so far: 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4); average=2. I select L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average (2) to reflect mixed but recent 3-period delay evidence. I select mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding cost given current large in-transit volume and profit/holding equal ($1/$1). Using defaults lets OR cap orders given pipeline to avoid overstock while accounting for inferred lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=71, in-transit=325. Historical demand samples: [122,121,60,83,105] (mean=98.2). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 3 periods (P1->P4, P4->P7) and one 1-period outlier (P3->P4). Pipeline is large (325) and shipments have been delayed historically, so infer recent lead-time behavior rather than trusting promised value. I choose L via recent_N to capture the observed recent lead-time samples (3 most recent observed lead times = [3,1,3]) to let the OR engine size orders for the longer effective lead time. For demand, no sustained regime change detected, so use default (all-sample) forecast for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat. These settings bias orders toward covering the multi-period demand implied by observed lead times while relying on historical demand mean to avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period4, Period4 order arrived Period7)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Historical demand samples: [122,121,60,83,105], mean=98.2. Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 3 periods. Current on-hand 108 + in-transit 227 = 335 units; (1+L)*mean = 4*98.2 = 392.8, so pipeline+on-hand is slightly below the 4-period expected demand\u2014params aim to reflect confirmed L=3 and use full-sample demand stats so OR backend raises orders to restore cover. Methods: set L explicitly to 3 (confirmed), use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 (confirmed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Current on-hand=7, in-transit=281 (total pipeline=288). To protect service given confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly=3. I forecast demand over review+lead (1+L=4) using recent full-sample mean scaled \u21d2 mu_hat \u2248 430 units (explicit) to cover expected 4-period demand. Demand volatility (std of historical demands scaled by sqrt(4)) \u2248 61.5 units (explicit) to set safety stock; these parameters steer the OR backend toward higher replenishment now to utilize large in-transit stock while reducing risk of stockouts given 3-period actual lead time.

On-hand=0, in-transit=423 \u2014 substantial pipeline expected to arrive given LT=3; no single-period spike in demand (historical samples: 122,121,60,83,105).

Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12. On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed in history), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Demand history (Periods 7-11: 47,83,123,92,119) suggests a recent regime with higher variability than earliest samples; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime. With L=3, using recent 5-period demand stabilizes the (1+L) forecast and the volatility estimate so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given delayed arrivals and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=134, in-transit=205 provide coverage but overdue/lost orders have occurred historically; using explicit L=3 ensures the OR engine plans for the longer realized pipeline. I select mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=3, giving a conservative base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost under confirmed longer lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14. History shows actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (arrivals from P1\u2192P4 and P4\u2192P7). Current on-hand=32, in-transit=279 \u2014 ample pipeline but long lead time and recent demand variability (samples: 122,121,60,83,105). To ensure the OR engine accounts for the confirmed longer lead time, I explicitly set L=3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1). This keeps orders sized to cover the 4-period demand window while letting the OR cap limit excessive single-period orders.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. Recent observed actual lead times cluster around 3 periods (confirmed at Period_8) though promised=2; pipeline is large (381 in-transit) and on-hand=0. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the persistent 3-period reality). Demand has been ~100 units recently (last 5 periods mean \u2248105); to reflect the most relevant demand regime I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility across the review+lead period. This combination signals the OR engine to target a base-stock aligned with the higher effective lead time while using recent demand to avoid overstock given substantial in-transit units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) average 98.2 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=386. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals since Period 4\u2014treat actual lead time as 3 to be conservative. With L=3, (1+L)=4 so target demand across review+lead ~4\xd7mean \u2192 backend default mu_hat is appropriate. Pipeline (386) is ~7 units short of 4-period expected demand (~392.8), so using L=3 and default variance allows the OR engine to size orders to restore cover while balancing profit vs holding cost.

To ensure orders cover the full review+lead horizon, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and available historical demand samples.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent demand stable but volatile; on-hand=31, in-transit=290 (ample pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (arrivals observed P4 and P7). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 13-17 demands = 102,130,123,139,107) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent5). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock to the observed 3-period lead time and recent demand, avoiding underordering given long lead time while limiting excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (several P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) with occasional 1\u20132 period events; average observed lead time \u22482.3. I set L by 'calculate' so the OR engine uses the empirical average lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u201318, mean \u2248107.83) is stable without a recent sustained regime shift, so I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices let the optimizer size the base-stock to cover the review+lead demand implied by observed lead-time while relying on the engine's cap to limit excessive orders given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded lead-time observations show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple P4/P7/P8/P12/P16/P17 evidence). Recent demand has declined over the last 5 periods (P15-P19: 123,139,107,78,66). To balance service vs holding cost I estimate lead time using the most recent 5 observed lead times and base demand and volatility on the most recent 5 demand samples so the OR engine reacts to the recent downward demand trend while respecting observed longer lead-times and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

To ensure pipeline covers the review+lead horizon and because lead time is confirmed longer than promised, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from all demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this keeps the OR engine's base-stock/backlog cap logic intact while the explicit L ensures orders target a 4-period demand horizon and mitigates stockouts from prolonged delivery times.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Recent demand has declined from earlier peaks; last 5 demands (P17\u2013P21) = [107,78,66,49,75], mean=75. To respect confirmed LT=3 and recent lower demand, I use L=explicit 3 and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods so the OR engine sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current lower-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility. This keeps service reasonable given long lead times and avoids excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead times vary but average >2 (several confirmed 3-period arrivals). Use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let backend adjust review+lead horizon; use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes demand over (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the large pipeline while balancing holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 20\u201324 = 49,75,121,182,122) shows a higher and volatile regime; I use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last five periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 this increases coverage for the elevated recent demand while letting the capped-order cap limit extreme orders and control holding cost.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed-average lead time (captures recent mix of 1\u20133 period arrivals). With L\u22482.3, default mu_hat and sigma_hat use all five demand samples (mean=98.2) scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this yields an expected demand across the review+lead period \u2248324 units. Pipeline (440) comfortably exceeds that, so no aggressive ordering signal is needed. Using defaults balances service (meets ~expected demand over lead) while avoiding extra holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=440 (covers future demand but arrivals will be observed with one-period delay). Recent demand has increased starting Period 23 (periods 23-26: 182,122,179,154) \u2014 I forecast using the most recent regime to avoid underordering. Therefore set L explicitly to 3 to match observed actual lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent N=4 periods (most recent sustained regime) so the backend targets service while limiting holding given high holding cost equal to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 23: Periods 23-26 demand = [182,122,179,154], average=159.25 over 4 periods (sustained 4 periods)

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: recent history shows a confirmed lead time of 3 periods (arrivals observed consistent with L=3) and a sustained demand regime since Period_23 (Periods 23-27 mean \u2248162.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=637 (covers upcoming arrivals but may include long pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher regime (Periods 23-27) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while accounting for confirmed longer lead time to avoid stockouts; using recent statistics keeps safety stock aligned to current regime and the OR engine will cap orders per its policy to limit excess holdings.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observed 3-period arrivals). Demand regime shifted starting Period 23 (Periods 23-26 avg=159.25); recent variability includes a low outlier in Period 28 (26). On-hand=0, in-transit=649 which is ample to cover (1+L)=4 periods at the elevated demand. I set L explicit=3 to capture the confirmed longer lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-changepoint regime while smoothing the Period 28 outlier. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend size base stock for the sustained higher demand while using observed lead time so pipeline calculations avoid under-ordering given many overdue/lost shipments historically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-105.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=151, in-transit=452. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple 3-period observations and a recent 2-period arrival (Period27\u2192Period29). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 23 (avg ~159 over P23\u2013P26). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5), I use an L estimate based on all observed lead times (calculate) to let the backend average evidence. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N (N=7 covering Periods 23\u201329) so mu_hat reflects the newer higher-demand regime while still including the most recent low observations. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to capture volatility in the recent regime. These settings make the OR engine raise base stock for higher recent demand while using observed lead-time history to moderate pipeline assumptions and avoid excessive overstocking given holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Recent conclude messages show lead times have converged to ~2 periods (most recent arrivals: orders placed P27\u2192arrived P29 LT=2, P28\u2192P30 LT=2) after earlier 3-period episodes. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 23 (sustained); recent demand is best represented by the last 8 periods since the changepoint. I choose recent_N for L using the last 6 observed lead-time samples to capture the recent shortening to 2, and recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the post-changepoint demand mean and volatility. These settings instruct the OR engine to size base-stock for the higher recent demand while using a lead-time estimate that reduces unnecessary overordering given in-transit stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=446. Historical concludes show lead time recently shortened to ~2 (orders P27->P29 and P28->P30 both had lead_time=2) after earlier 3-period events. Demand regime shift began Period 23 and has persisted; recent regime covers Periods 23-31 (9 periods) with elevated and volatile demand. To reflect the recent faster arrivals, set L via recent_N using the last 4 observed lead-time realizations to emphasize the recent 2-period pattern. For demand, use recent_N over the 9-period post-changepoint regime to capture the new mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast and risk buffer. These choices help the OR backend target service under the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime increase earlier (Periods 23-26 avg\u2248159) but volatile demands since. On-hand=0, in-transit=463 (ample pipeline). Recent observed lead times vary (1\u20133). To adapt quickly to recent variability I set L based on recent lead-time observations and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent demand samples (responsive to regime shifts) so the OR backend targets higher base stock while avoiding excessive holding given current large pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=440 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period realizations earlier but mix of 1\u20133 recently; use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. Demand shows a regime shift around Periods 23\u201326 but recent realized demand (Periods 29\u201333 = [46,187,134,15,86]) is more representative of current volatility; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on latest demand. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent high-variance sequence while relying on pipeline (in-transit) to cover outstanding demand and avoid over-ordering given holding cost = profit.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (1,1,2,2 most recently) so I set L to recent_N with N=4 to capture the current shorter average (~1.5). Demand has a past regime spike (Periods 23-26 avg=159) but recent realized demand (Periods 29-34 = [46,187,134,15,86,123]) is volatile; I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current demand level/volatility and avoids overreacting to isolated spikes. This balances service (use pipeline + short inferred L) versus holding cost given large in-transit stock and profit=holding cost parity.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133), recent concluded lead times lean shorter (last 4 observed = 2,2,1,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). Demand showed a sustained regime shift in Periods 23\u201326 but recent demand is volatile; to be responsive I use short recent windows. I set L via recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent realized lead-time behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime while remaining responsive to recent spikes. These choices aim to align the backend base-stock with recent realized lead times and recent demand, avoiding overcommitment given large in-transit inventory (440) and equal profit/holding costs which favor balanced service vs. holding risk.

Demand has shown a past regime shift around Period_23 but recent history is mixed; with a large in-transit position I keep demand forecasting method conservative. Set L by calculating the average observed lead time to reconcile promised vs. actual delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*overall mean and sqrt(1+L)*overall std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given the sizable pipeline while avoiding overfitting to short recent noise or zeros in on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Recent concluded lead-times vary (1\u20133); most recent concluded lead-times show a mix including two 2s and several 1s/3s. To be responsive to recent variability I set L by averaging the most recent lead-time observations. Demand shows high variability and a prior regime shift at Period 23; I'll forecast using the last 5 demand samples (Periods 35\u201339) to capture latest pattern. Using recent-N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses safety stock on current volatility while L recent_N captures recent lead-time behavior. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable lead-times) against holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical arrivals show mixed lead times (many 3s, some 2s and 1s); average observed lead time ~2.07. Demand experienced a sustained higher regime around Periods 23-26 (recorded previously). Given substantial pipeline (440) and confirmed variability in lead time, I select L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR backend adapt the review+lead horizon; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost while accounting for inferred longer-than-promised lead times.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods (Period1\u2192P4, Period4\u2192P7, Period9\u2192P12, etc.), and a demand regime shift was detected starting Period 23 (Periods 23-26 avg=159.25). To ensure pipeline covers the longer realized lead time and to reflect the higher recent demand regime, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use a recent_N=4 forecast window (the sustained regime of Periods 23-26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the higher-demand regime and increased service, while the cap will limit extreme over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but frequently 3-period actual lead times; use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. Demand exhibited a sustained regime shift starting Period 23 (Periods 23-26 avg=159.25); to capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses most recent sustained regime). Sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (by sizing orders to the confirmed higher demand regime) against holding cost by relying on backend volatility and calculated lead-time estimate.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=440 units (large pipeline). Historical conclues show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (notably P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) though some shorter arrivals exist; I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect mixed history (method=calculate). Demand history shows a sustained regime shift around Periods 23\u201326 but overall high variance thereafter; with a large pipeline I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock using full-sample stats while respecting averaged lead time. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while leveraging the substantial in-transit inventory to limit new orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concludes show multiple lead-time=3 observations (Periods 4,7,8,16,17,29) so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = [177,88,70,150,115]) is the best indicator of current regime volatility; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap reflect the last-5 demand mean and variability. This balances service (capture recent elevated & variable demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume. No new sustained changepoint detected.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period 46. On-hand=0, in-transit=440 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show mixed actual lead times but average observed lead time \u22482 periods. Demand history shows recent sustained higher regime detected earlier (Periods 23-26). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed-average lead time (captures variable arrivals). With L\u22482, using mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean demand and volatility from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and large in-transit inventory. This avoids overfitting short-term noise while recognizing the longer effective lead time and existing pipeline to prevent excess ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concluded lead times are mixed (confirmed 3 in early periods, 2 observed at P27->P29); no recent sustained shift away from promised lead time=2. Demand history since Period1 is variable with a known regime shift around Periods 23-26 already recorded. To let the OR engine apply its statistical policy using promised lead time and full-sample statistics, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This handles the mixed lead-time evidence conservatively while the large in-transit position will be reconciled when arrivals conclude.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Recent demand is variable; past sustained regime shift (Periods 23-26) noted but recent five demands (Periods 43-47 = [150,115,8,38,103]) show a lower/variable short-run mean. Several historical arrivals show lead times of 1\u20133 periods; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let backend infer current effective L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the last 5 periods' demand pattern while accounting for pipeline via backend. This balances service (profit=holding so equal weight) against holding cost given large in-transit stock (440) \u2014 relying on calculated L lets backend scale (1+L) properly and recent demand stats avoid over-ordering for stale high-demand regimes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical lead-time observations average ~2 periods (mix of 1\u20133), so use calculated L to reflect realized delivery timing. Demand has been volatile and regime-shifted earlier (Periods 23\u201326), so I use a recent_N forecast (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level/volatility and to size orders to cover (L+1) periods while limiting holding cost given high holding=$1/unit.

Pipeline (440) is already large relative to recent demands, so I use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overfitting short-term noise while letting the OR engine cap orders appropriately. This balances service (large pipeline) against holding cost and accounts for possible longer actual lead times inferred from history.
