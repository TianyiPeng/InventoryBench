  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows most arrivals have actual lead_time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P14\u2192P17). A one-off P38\u2192P39 (lead_time=1) exists but is not sustained; therefore continue to assume effective lead_time \u22483. Inventory & demand analysis: empirical single-period mean from provided samples (Periods 1\u20135: 132,74,101,90,135) = 106.4 units. With effective L=3, planning horizon is L+1 = 4 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248 4 \xd7 106.4 = 425.6 units. Current position: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 490 units, so pipeline exceeds the 4-period coverage target by \u224864.4 units. Cost trade-off: holding cost = $1/period vs. profit $4/unit favors avoiding unnecessary ordering when pipeline already covers the review+lead demand. OR recommended 0; I accept that recommendation because pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand even under the longer observed lead time. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid extra holding cost and because arriving pipeline already likely fulfills upcoming demand; monitor conclude messages to detect any further lost shipments or sustained lead-time changes.",
