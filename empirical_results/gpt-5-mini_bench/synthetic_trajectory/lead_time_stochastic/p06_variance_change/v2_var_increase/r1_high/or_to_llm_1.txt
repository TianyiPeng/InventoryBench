Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Demand outlook: recent realized demand (Periods 43\u201347 = 124, 101, 156, 24, 113) averages \u2248104 units/period; (L+1)=3 periods demand \u2248312 units. OR recommended 0 units because it uses pipeline + promised L; with 431 in-transit we already expect coverage for the next 3 periods (431 > 312) so ordering risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is high but not worth stocking excess. Risk check: if a portion of the 431 were lost, we'd need to see \u2265119 units lost to justify ordering now (431\u2212119=312); we have no concluded evidence of such a large new loss. Decision: place 0 units to avoid extra holding cost and follow OR recommendation.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=431 units. Demand outlook: historical sample mean \u2248106 units/period (from provided samples and recent observed demands), so (L+1)=3 periods' demand \u2248 318 units. Decision logic: OR recommends 0. Pipeline (431) comfortably covers the (L+1) coverage target (\u2248318) and exceeds the OR base-stock cap rationale, so placing additional order increases holding cost without improving profit (profit >> holding cost but excess inventory ties up capital and incurs per-period holding cost). Risk check: if some in-transit units are later revealed lost, we would need to react, but current concluded messages do not indicate new losses.
