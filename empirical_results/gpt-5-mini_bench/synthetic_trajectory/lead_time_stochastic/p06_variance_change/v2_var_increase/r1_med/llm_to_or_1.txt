Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Using promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all provided historical samples (no changepoint or seasonality signals). This ensures the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples to balance service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=151 (order from P1), Period 1 concluded that P1 order arrived=0 so no confirmed lead-time change yet. Use promised lead time (default) because we have no concluded arrivals that contradict it. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5: 132,74,101,90,135) show no sustained regime shift; use default forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and outstanding pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: no concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=296 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time is 2 and there is no evidence to override it. Use default lead time so backend assumes promised L=2. Demand history (Periods 1-5 samples) shows mean ~106.4; with L=2 use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (covering 3 periods of demand) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline and unresolved arrivals.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (arrived=0 each conclude) despite promised lead time=2; this suggests shipments are delayed or lost. To be conservative, set lead time L explicitly to 3 to cover longer transit. Use default demand forecast (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) and default volatility (backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This increases pipeline coverage (1+L periods) to protect service level given missing arrivals while letting OR backend balance profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not arrived by Period_3 conclude (arrived=0 for P1,P2,P3); indicates sustained delivery delays or potential lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $332.00, Daily Holding Cost: $109.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=109, in-transit=235. Historical demand samples mean=106.4 (Periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); average = 2, so set L by calculate to capture actual observed mean lead time. Use mu_hat default to compute (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples, giving the OR engine a 3-period demand forecast anchored to full history. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These choices balance higher safety stock due to confirmed delayed shipments while letting OR engine apply its service-level cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 6. On-hand=44, in-transit=310. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed actual lead times (P1 order arrived in P4 -> lead_time=3; P3 order arrived in P4 -> lead_time=1) and P2/P5 orders remain missing/delayed. To be conservative about variable/occasionally long lead times, I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (method=calculate). Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained regime shift; use default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat using all samples and the chosen L. These choices balance service (by recognizing longer observed lead times) and holding cost (by using overall historical mean/variance rather than overreacting to recent noise).

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=364. History shows arrivals with variable lead times (P1->arrived in P4 => LT=3; P3->arrived in P4 => LT=1) and several recent orders still outstanding (ordered in P4\u2013P6 with no arrivals). Given mixed observed lead times, use calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Demand samples (historical dataset) will be used by default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat to produce (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, keeping forecasting simple while the backend adjusts for the inferred LT. This balances service (by increasing review+lead coverage when LT rises) against holding cost and acknowledges possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times: 3 (P1\u2192P4), 1 (P3\u2192P4), 3 (P4\u2192P7) \u2192 use average of observed lead times to capture actual delivery behavior. On-hand=0, in-transit=319 so immediate stock exists but arrival confirmation lag/risk persists; no urgent replenishment. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to emphasize latest demand regime while including enough history. Keep sigma_hat as default to reflect overall demand volatility for the chosen lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9. On-hand=0, in-transit=257. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1,3,3,1} from concluded messages), average ~2.2 periods. Demand history (periods 1-8) shows no sustained 3+ period shift (single large spike at Period 8), so I will let the backend compute demand forecast using the full sample set while adjusting lead time to reflect observed average. I choose L by "calculate" (uses average observed lead times) so the OR engine accounts for the realized slower deliveries; mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" so the backend uses all samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead times. This approach reconciles the sizable in-transit stock and avoids overreacting to a single demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,3,1,1 \u2192 avg 2.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=348. Using L=calculate lets backend use observed lead-time history (avg=2) which matches promised. Demand history sample mean=106.4 (from provided historical samples); with L=2 the (1+L) multiplier=3 so expected 3-period demand \u2248319.2 and current pipeline (348) exceeds that, so no urgent upward adjustment. I select default demand/volatility methods to let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given sufficient pipeline inventory and confirmed average lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_11. On-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical concluded lead times show multiple observations (1 and 3 periods) averaging ~2, so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 6\u201310) is clearly higher than earlier periods; I base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods to capture the new regime. These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N N=5, sigma_hat recent_N N=5) ensure the OR backend targets stock for the recent higher-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} (6 observations), average = 2 periods; actual lead time alternates between 1 and 3.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=506. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times alternating 1 and 3 (observed set {3,1,3,3,1,1}, avg\u22482). Several early orders were delayed but recent pattern confirms variability around mean 2. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine uses empirical average (captures alternating 1/3 pattern). For demand I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the backend compute the base-stock using full-sample stats and the inferred lead time. This balances service (capture longer occasional 3-period delays) vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Recent demand samples (132,74,101,90,135) have mean 106.4; on-hand=105, in-transit=267 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (1 and 3) with average ~2; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Set L=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecast = (1+L)\xd7overall mean and volatility = sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std \u2014 conservative aggregate estimates given mixed lead times and no clear demand regime change. This balances service level (coverage for L+1 periods) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=322. Recent observed lead times (from concluded messages) alternate 1 and 3 with average ~2; shipments have been delayed intermittently but recent pattern (last 6 observations) best reflects current variability. Demand last 5 concluded periods (P9\u2013P13) average ~118.6 \u2014 use recent demand to capture current regime. Choices: L set by recent_N (N=6) to reflect observed alternating 1/3 lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat set by recent_N (N=5) to base forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (covers review+lead via backend). This balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given existing large in-transit volume; using recent windows avoids contaminating estimates with early-period anomalies and delayed arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=394. Historical demand samples (periods 1-5): {132,74,101,90,135} and later observed demands through P14 show persistent demand near 100-135 with occasional spikes. Multiple shipments experienced delays (lead times observed = {3,1,3,3,1,1}, avg\u22482) and some long delays/lost arrivals early. To be conservative about lead time uncertainty I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method='calculate'). Given large in-transit inventory, use default demand aggregation so backend sets mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using observed avg lead time) against holding cost given substantial pipeline; defaults let the OR engine apply its capped ordering logic to avoid excessive new orders while covering (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=428. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times {3,1,3,3,1,1} with average = 2 periods; multiple past missing arrivals indicate intermittent delays but average lead time centers on 2. Given large pipeline (428) and no new sustained demand regime detected (demand samples consistent with historical series), set L by calculate (average observed lead time=2) and use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level (accounting for longer average lead time) while avoiding aggressive extra stocking because substantial inventory is already in-transit.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20133 periods) with average \u22482 and intermittent 3-period delays; several shipments were delayed earlier causing large pipeline. I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures realized variability rather than promised=2). Demand history is limited to provided samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given significant pipeline and lead-time uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent history shows actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3 with average \u22482 (evidence in conclude messages P4,P7,P8,P12,P14,P16,P17). On-hand=22, in-transit=284 so pipeline is large; some past orders were delayed/lost early but recent pattern supports mean lead time ~2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average (captures the 1/3 alternation). For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full sample set (Period_1..5) and the inferred L. This balances service level (profit>holding cost) with current high pipeline and avoids overreacting to short-term spikes or earlier lost shipments.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=405. Historical arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries with intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals; recent history (11 observed lead times) sums to avg \u22482.45. There are sustained delivery delays/loss risk earlier (multiple long gaps). I choose L=calculate so backend uses the observed average lead time rather than the promised 2; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine size base-stock using full-sample stats while accounting for the longer effective lead time. This balances service (capturing longer lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit volume and zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed longer/variable than promised: 11 observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3], average = 2.45 periods; deliveries frequently 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: demand history shows moderate, variable weekly demand with recent stockouts and confirmed variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 \u2014 substantial pipeline but several past orders experienced 3-period delays, so use observed lead-time average to capture variability. Set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 21: recent demand has been volatile with large recent values (Periods 16-20 demand = 115,118,42,76,150). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (large pipeline but many past orders had delayed/3-period arrivals). Lead time has varied historically between 1\u20133 periods; use backend-calculated average to capture this. To respond to the recent higher and variable demand while respecting lead-time uncertainty, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime (Periods 16-20). This balances service (cover near-term spike) vs. holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=439. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (many lead times =3) and an average >2; shipments often arrive after 3 periods. To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers demand during delayed deliveries, set lead time L=3 (explicit). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging full-sample demand statistics scaled for the longer lead+review period). This increases ordered pipeline to protect service level given observed multi-period delays while the large in-transit quantity will temper orders via the capped policy.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (many orders with lead_time=3) and multiple lost/delayed shipments earlier; pipeline is large now but promised L=2 appears optimistic. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed frequent 3-period actual lead times so the OR backend plans across a longer pipeline. For demand, historical sample mean = 106.4; using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled volatility consistently with chosen L, balancing service level vs holding cost given the higher effective lead time and large in-transit volume.

Large pipeline outstanding \u2014 avoid manual L shortening that would inflate orders. Use lead-time inference from observed history so backend averages actual lead times (calculate).

Demand sample mean=106.4 (samples:132,74,101,90,135). I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (captures variable/longer real LT). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (captures longer LT via L) against holding cost while the large in-transit stock will naturally limit new orders via the capped policy.

Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (many lead_time=3 observations and large in-transit stock without recent arrivals), so actual lead time appears longer than promised. I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline (review+lead = 1+3 periods). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, increasing target base-stock and safety stock to protect service level given delayed deliveries while letting the capped order cap moderate order size to control holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times with many 3-period deliveries and an average >2; several orders were delayed/lost earlier so pipeline is large but uncertain. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time from concluded history. Demand recently elevated and volatile (recent demands: 56,150,83,167,52); to capture the current regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the review+lead demand forecast and volatility reflect the latest pattern while the backend balances service vs holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. History shows highly variable/lengthened lead times (many 3-period arrivals, average ~2.45) and intermittent lost/delayed shipments; demand has been volatile with many stockouts. Use L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times (captures realized variability). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for full-history demand and the inferred longer lead time while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical concluded lead-times show high variability with many 3-period deliveries; average lead time \u2248 2. Use 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (captures the alternating 1\u20133 pattern). Demand history provided in dataset is limited (five samples); use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all respectively. This keeps forecasts grounded in the provided sample set while letting the backend account for the empirically observed lead-time when sizing orders. High in-transit inventory noted \u2014 this should reduce orders automatically when pipeline covers (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=442. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries (many observed lead_times = 3) and recent average >2; shipments are often delayed beyond promised 2. To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain/long arrivals, set L explicitly to 3 (conservative). Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (captures all historical demand: mean of [132,74,101,90,135]=106.4 \u2192 (1+3)*106.4=425.6). Use sigma_hat default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) reflecting increased uncertainty over longer review+lead period. This balances higher service level (avoid costly lost sales given volatile/long lead times) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, large in-transit=472 units, recent history shows variable/long lead times (many 3-period deliveries; carry-over notes avg ~2.45). To let the OR engine use observed lead-time history, set L to calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand while accounting for the inferred lead time and large pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=442. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with many 3-period and some 1-2 period deliveries (multiple observations through Period_32). Given this sustained variability and past evidence that actual lead time averages >2, I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so L reflects observed variability. Demand samples (132,74,101,90,135) are limited and no clear recent regime shift is detected, so use default forecasting: mu_hat and sigma_hat set to "default" so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std respectively. This balances service (using empirical L) against holding cost while avoiding overfitting to transient arrival noise.

Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=442. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (multiple periods with lead_time=3; avg \u22482.45) and many late/lost shipments earlier. To be conservative I set explicit lead time L=3 to force the OR engine to plan for longer arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand and accounts for observed variability while the large in-transit helps satisfy upcoming demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=474; historical demand samples mean= (132,74,101,90,135)=106 (seed) but recent periods show higher volatility. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times frequently 3 and average >2 (carry-over). Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times (captures observed 1/3 alternation and frequent 3-period deliveries). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to focus on the most recent regime (Periods 30-34 demands = 66,92,135,115,52) and scale by (1+L) internally; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (accounting for longer/variable lead time) while keeping safety stock tuned to recent demand to limit holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures observed variability and longer deliveries). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and vol scaled by sqrt(1+L); this balances service level given variable lead time while avoiding aggressive explicit overstock given large in-transit quantity.

Numerous delayed deliveries and mixed observed lead times (1 and 3 periods) \u2014 evidence favors using observed lead-time average rather than promised. Choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use all observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging full history to balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Current Period 39. History shows variable/long lead times (many concluded arrivals with W often 3; prior analysis avg ~2.45). On-hand=0, in-transit=442 so pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed/variable. I select L='calculate' to have the OR backend use the observed average lead time (captures the confirmed variability > promised 2). For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting conservative given uncertain lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term demand spikes. These settings prioritize recovering service level while controlling holding costs given the existing large in-transit volume and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_40: recent demand is high and volatile (last 5 demands ~55,113,137,62,184; mean \u2248110). On-hand=0, in-transit=442 (large pipeline, some shipments overdue historically). Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period deliveries and average >2; to protect service level I set lead time explicitly to 3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current regime (N=5) so the OR backend will size base-stock and cap to cover (1+L) periods under the higher recent mean and volatility. This balances avoiding stockouts (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess holding given large existing pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=532. Historical arrivals show variable/long lead times (many 3-period deliveries; average >2). Demand recent run (Periods 36-40 = 113,137,62,184,156) has mean ~130.4, above the long-run sample mean. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (reflects observed variability and frequent 3-period deliveries). For demand I choose recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent higher-demand regime across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Sigma_hat left as default so variability is computed from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). Given large in-transit (532) no explicit inflation is needed now, but using calculated L and recent demand mean ensures base-stock and cap reflect longer/more-variable lead times and recent elevated demand to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=532. Historical concluded lead times remain variable with many 3-period deliveries; pipeline large so avoid aggressive new orders. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures variability around ~2\u20133). Demand recently elevated/variable (last 5 concluded demands: 137,62,184,156,186) \u2014 use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock targets reflect the latest regime while the large in-transit prevents over-ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=601 \u2014 large pipeline but many past orders experienced 1\u20133 period lead times with frequent 3-period delays; recent concluded arrivals (up to Period_36) give average observed lead time ~2.13 periods. To account for empirical lead-time variability I ask backend to use calculate (avg observed lead times). Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained, recent regime shift in demand; use default demand/variance calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances higher effective lead time (better service) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume and holding=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=511 units. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with many 3-period deliveries (recent observed avg \u22482.45, frequent 3s). Pipeline is large so avoid explicit mu/sigma tweaks; set L to be inferred from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend accounts for the longer/variable lead time while leveraging full sample history. This balances service (capture longer lead times) vs holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=511. Recent demand (Periods 40-44) = [156,186,90,124,101], mean \u2248131.4 and volatile. Historical concluded lead times remain variable with frequent 3-period deliveries; promised L=2 but variability persists. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor to the last five high/variable periods and avoid dilution by older low samples. Sigma also recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. This ensures base_stock targets current demand level while accounting for observed lead-time variation and avoids overreacting to distant history. Current in-transit 511 provides multi-period cover (~3.9 periods at recent mean), so parameters will let OR cap orders appropriately and reduce excess holding costs.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=463. Historical concluded arrivals show highly variable/long lead times (many 3-period deliveries; average >2). To account for this persistent lead-time variability I ask backend to calculate L from observed lead times so the OR engine uses realized lead-time history. Demand samples (provided) are limited; use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps forecasting anchored to the full sample while letting the backend adjust the review+lead horizon using the calculated L; given large pipeline we avoid explicit over-ordering while the backend caps orders.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=463. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (many orders observed with lead_time=3; recent history average lead_time >2). To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable/long actual lead times, set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level (longer L increases required pipeline) against holding cost. No single-period arrival confirmations available this period; parameters chosen to cover (L+1) periods of demand with conservative L to hedge delayed shipments.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (many 3-period deliveries and some 1-2), so infer lead time from observed history rather than trusting promised. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to capture this variability; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across review+lead using full sample history and balances profit vs holding cost.

To capture actual variability I request the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples given the chosen L; this balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while letting the engine account for increased safety stock if L>promised.
