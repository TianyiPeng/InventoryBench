Using initial samples from train.csv: /shared/share_malatown/OR-Agent-GPT5mini-benchmark/examples/benchmark/synthetic_trajectory/lead_time_stochastic/p06_variance_change/v2_var_increase/r2_high/train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 132), ('Period_2', 74), ('Period_3', 101), ('Period_4', 90), ('Period_5', 135)]
  Mean: 106.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. chips(Regular) profit=$19, holding=$1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and demand stats from all available samples (Periods 1\u20135) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect full history. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to the historical mean/variance while avoiding premature adjustments from insufficient evidence.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=151 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed; treat promised lead time as default. Demand context: historical samples show mean ~106.4 units/period; with promised L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods so default mu_hat and sigma_hat are appropriate. Using defaults keeps the OR engine's baseline forecast and lets it account for pipeline while we wait for arrival confirmation. No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=304 (orders from P1+P2). No concluded arrivals yet (period concludes for P1/P2 show arrived=0 but those orders are scheduled to arrive during Period_3 arrival phase and will be visible in Period_4). No sustained signal of lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and demand forecast based on all historical samples. This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat to cover review+lead period (1+L)\xd7history mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7history std, balancing service level (high profit) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=422, and concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20133 show arrived=0 despite orders placed; demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean=106.4. I will keep L as the promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrival shows actual lead time yet. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding given current uncertainty and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/missing shipments suspected: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have arrived=0 in conclude messages while in-transit=422 units remain (suggests actual lead time > promised 2 or potential lost shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1931.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=159, in-transit=153. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1} \u2192 avg 2), indicating actual lead time around 2. Historical demand samples mean=106.4 (Periods 1-5). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed-average lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of demand) against holding cost while accounting for recent evidence of delayed shipments.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=36, in-transit=305. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4), indicating variable lead time but average \u22482. Demand history mean=106.4 (samples:132,74,101,90,135). To balance service vs holding cost and let OR backend account for promised lead_time while reflecting observed variability, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std (backend will compute), which targets (1+L) periods of demand coverage and keeps cap logic intact given in-transit stock and potential lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=456. History shows intermittent arrivals: observed lead_times = 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); several recent orders (P5,P6) have not yet arrived. Given mixed evidence of actual lead time and uncertain lost shipments, I let the backend compute an average observed lead time from concluded messages (calculate) and use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (captures increased lead-time observed) while avoiding overfitting to sparse recent arrivals.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=525. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (order P1 -> arrived P4 => lead=3; order P3 -> arrived P4 => lead=1). Some orders (e.g., P2) remain unconfirmed and may be delayed or lost. To be robust to variable lead time while avoiding overreacting to limited samples, I let the system infer an average observed lead time (method=calculate) and use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. This balances service (by letting L reflect observed variability) against holding cost (by not inflating demand or safety stock from short-term noise).

Daily Profit: $2489.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2399.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: demand samples show recent mean ~106.4 units/period (samples:132,74,101,90,135). Visible conclude messages indicate mixed lead times: observed lead_times = {3 (P4 from P1), 1 (P4 from P3), 3 (P8 from P5), 1 (P8 from P7)} giving average=2. On-hand (90) + in-transit (304)=394 units currently in pipeline. I select L by "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (matches observed 1/3 pattern average=2). For demand and volatility I choose "default" mu_hat and "default" sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively\u2014this balances service level and holding cost given confirmed variable lead times and the available pipeline stock. This approach is conservative given the intermittent delayed arrivals and substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time pattern confirmed: observed lead_times in concl. messages = 3 (orders from P1 and P5) and 1 (orders from P3 and P7); average observed lead_time = 2 periods (evidence: P4 arrivals: P1->3, P3->1; P8 arrivals: P5->3, P7->1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=434. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) with average \u22482; recent demand samples (Periods1\u20135:132,74,101,90,135) and later periods show continued similar demand (~100\u2013135). Given confirmed average lead time \u22482 and no new sustained demand regime shift, use calculated average lead time so backend captures observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring base-stock reflects full review+lead demand and variance for service level versus holding cost tradeoff. This also accounts for sizable in-transit inventory when computing order-up-to target and lets OR engine cap orders appropriately given promised lead-time assumptions.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=520. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times of 3 and 1 (P1->3, P3->1, P5->3, P7->1) averaging 2 periods. I select L by calculating the average observed lead time to reflect actual behavior rather than the promised value. Given L will be set from observed data, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; with in-transit=520 this pipeline already exceeds the (1+L)-period demand estimate, avoiding aggressive replenishment and balancing service level vs holding cost.

To reflect confirmed average lead time and use full-sample demand statistics, set L via calculate (backend will compute average observed lead time), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=80, in-transit=304. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.17) so actual lead time centers around 2 periods but with variability and some 3-period delays. I select L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) using all demand samples; this balances service level and holding cost given uncertain but confirmed ~2-period lead time and volatile arrivals. No clear new sustained demand regime or loss pattern to record.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=1, in-transit=440. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (avg\u22482.17) so I use calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time. Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level given elevated pipeline and avoids overfitting to recent noisy periods or lost-shipment anomalies.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=514. Historical concluded lead-times show mixed 1 and 3 period arrivals with average \u22482 \u2014 align L with observed average. Demand samples (provided) are limited and show no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand estimate across all samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (use observed average lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=514. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (1,2,3) with evidence of delayed arrivals and some periods with no arrivals; to let backend compute a data-driven lead-time estimate use 'calculate'. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting backend incorporate all observed demand history. This balances service (by using observed average lead time) vs holding cost (default safety stock formula).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=95, in-transit=378. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) with average observed lead time \u22482; several delayed arrivals occurred earlier but recent pattern supports mean = 2. No sustained demand regime change detected (recent demands ~100\u2013140). Set L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect realized behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine apply full-sample demand stats; this balances service (accounting for the longer realized lead time) against holding cost given relatively high profit margin.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=83, in-transit=346. Historical concluded lead_times show frequent 3-period arrivals (P1->4, P5->8, P9->12, P13->16, P14->17) with occasional 2s and 1s. To let the OR engine internal defaults use observed lead-time behavior and full-sample demand statistics, I request the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand scaling and volatility ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (captures longer realized lead times) against holding cost without overreacting to short single-period anomalies.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: arrivals with lead_time=3 observed for orders placed on Periods 1->arrived P4, 5->P8, 9->P12, 13->P16, 14->P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=427. Concluded arrivals through Period 18 show a consistent lead-time pattern of 3 periods for multiple orders (Periods 1,5,9,13,14 arrivals had lead_time=3) \u2014 recent evidence supports treating actual lead time as 3. To protect service given delayed/lost shipments, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend plans over a longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving sample-based forecast and letting the capped policy limit orders vs. inventory risk.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=514. Historical conclude messages show repeated lead_time=3 arrivals (Periods 1->4,5->8,9->12,13->16,14->17) \u2014 actual lead time elevated vs promised. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean=106.4; with review+lead (1+L)=4 this yields forecast mu_hat=4\xd7106.4=425.6 (explicit) to cover the extended coverage window and preserve service while accepting holding cost. I leave sigma_hat as default so backend computes volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level due to longer, variable lead times against holding cost given current large in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concl. messages show a sustained pattern of 3-period arrivals (confirmed in Period 18), so use explicit L=3 to reflect actual lead time rather than promised 2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this captures full-sample demand while scaling safety stock for the longer lead time and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated lead_time=3 (multiple orders P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17 and Period 18 confirmation). Promised lead_time=2 appears unreliable; I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality so pipeline coverage accounts for longer arrivals. Demand has increased recently (last 5 demands = 86,129,41,133,192; recent mean ~116). To capture this upward shift without overreacting to a single spike, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service level against holding cost given longer lead time and recent demand rise.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=651. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,8,12,16,17,18) show repeated lead_time=3 arrivals; lead time confirmed as 3 periods. Demand recent tail (Periods 18-22 = 129,41,133,192,97) shows elevated and volatile demand; use recent 5-period stats to capture current regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality so pipeline calculations cover true transit. Set mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean = 4\xd7recent_mean, giving orders sized for four periods of current demand. Set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=74, in-transit=519. Historical concl. messages show mixed lead times (1 and 3), with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier; pipeline is large (519) so treat lead time based on observed history. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times from concl. messages. Demand baseline uses all samples (mu_hat='default') to keep forecast stable given limited clear recent demand regime shift; volatility likewise uses all samples (sigma_hat='default'). This balances service (large pipeline + calculated L) vs holding cost by not overreacting to recent mixed arrivals.

Demand historical samples (132,74,101,90,135) will be handled by default population stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this keeps forecasting conservative given uncertain lead time and large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=514. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times (1,2,3) but recent pattern leans >2. I set L via recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent lead-time behavior (avg \u22482.4) so the OR engine accounts for longer/mixed delays. Demand forecast uses default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) because available seed samples are limited and show no sustained, >3-period regime shift; sigma_hat default to let OR compute volatility over all samples. This balances higher protection for delayed arrivals (longer L) against holding cost via OR's capped ordering.

Given mixed but persistent lead-time evidence (multiple 3s and some 1\u20132s), I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding given high in-transit inventory and modest holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=532. Historical concluded lead_times show a mix of 3,2,1 with multiple 3-period observations (sustained); demand samples mean = 109.0 (periods 1\u20135 baseline) and recent demands are variable. Large in-transit balance and prior evidence of multi-period delays motivate estimating L from observed lead times rather than trusting the promise. I select L="calculate" so backend uses the average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default population estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine raises base stock to cover review+lead demand while default volatility avoids overfitting to short-term noise. This balances higher service level given in-transit inventory and the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, In-transit=514. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample lead_times = [3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,2,2,2], avg\u22482.23) indicating actual lead time slightly above promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures delayed shipments). For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while respecting the longer inferred lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=521, recent high demand spikes (e.g. Periods 21,30). History shows mixed actual lead times (1\u20133) with prior confirmation of 3 in Period 18; multiple outstanding in-transit units suggest longer/variable lead time or delayed arrivals. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures mixed/shifted LT). For demand I use mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 conservative aggregate forecast given variable lead times and large pipeline. This balances service (by letting backend inflate base_stock when avg LT>promised) versus holding cost risk from the large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=532. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead_times (1\u20133) with multiple confirmations of 3-period arrivals but overall average \u22482. To account for observed variability and let the OR engine compute pipeline coverage using observed lead times, set L by 'calculate' (backend averages observed lead times). Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std use all available demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average all observed lead times from concl. messages (captures realized variability vs promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, giving a robust baseline demand forecast and volatility that adapts to the calculated lead time while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (1\u20133) with computed average \u22482.14; several multi-period delayed arrivals observed, so use the empirically observed average lead time rather than promised. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use average observed lead time. For demand, I use default ( (1+L)\xd7mean of provided samples ) and default volatility so the OR engine applies its base-stock formula with the inferred lead time \u2014 this raises target pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time while default mu/sigma keep demand forecast anchored to the sample mean/variance, balancing service level and holding cost given high profit vs low holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (1\u20133) recently; most recent five observed lead_times \u2248 [1,2,2,2,1] indicating a short but variable lead time. Demand has been high in the last five periods (Periods 30\u201334). To capture recent lead-time variability and the recent high-demand regime, I set L using recent_N on the last 5 observed lead_times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 5 demand samples to bias forecasts toward the recent high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from estimated variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: recent demands are high and volatile (historical samples mean ~110s\u2013130s, spikes up to 192, recent periods demand 176,101,135,147,167,131). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with prior confirmation of 3 in multiple cases, so use observed lead-time average rather than promised. Set L="calculate" so backend uses average observed lead times. Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given profit vs holding cost while smoothing volatility and covering (L+1) periods of demand given the large in-transit position.

Historical concluded lead_times (observed across concludes) average \u22482.06 \u2192 use calculated average to capture the mixed 1\u20133 period arrivals rather than trusting promised=2 blindly. Demand sample mean from provided samples =106.4; using default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) keeps estimate anchored to historical demand and scales with inferred L. Use default sigma_hat to reflect sample variability over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (profit high relative to holding cost) by sizing base stock to cover ~3 periods of mean demand while preserving OR backend\u2019s cap behavior given the observed variable lead times and large in-transit inventory.

Given the variability and existing concluded lead-time data, let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded messages (method=calculate). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the calibrated base-stock and cap using the computed L.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=528. Historical concl. messages show multiple sustained lead_time=3 observations (confirmed through Period 18), so I treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative replenishment target that covers the extended pipeline and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=560. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times (1\u20133) with average \u22482.19; demand samples recent mean \u2248(132+74+101+90+135)/5=106.4 but backend will use full-sample mean. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average from concl. messages (captures realised variability > promised 2). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against low holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=560. Historical concluded lead_times vary (observed 1\u20133, multiple recent 3s) and there have been prolonged delays/lost arrivals earlier; pipeline is large so use observed-average lead time to let backend account for realized delays. Demand data show no sustained recent mean shift; use default demand/volatility computations so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use average L from observations) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=560. Historical concl. messages show multiple orders with lead_time=3 (sustained across many periods) so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed longer arrival pattern and to ensure pipeline coverage. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 etc.) will be used by backend default rules; using default for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples so safety stock and cap are consistent with L=3. This balances higher service-level need (longer lead time) against holding cost by relying on the backend's profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=32, in-transit=528. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (e.g., P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P41->P44) indicating actual lead time \u2267 promised 2; therefore set L method to calculate so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and volatility = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and variable lead times.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=528. Recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (e.g., Period 44: order on P41 arrived with lead_time=3) so I set lead time to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples with L=3, balancing service level (reduce stockouts under longer lead time) versus holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Historical concluded lead_times vary (1\u20133), with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals but also 1\u20132 observed; demand samples mean = 111.0 (from provided 5 samples). To let the backend use observed lead-time behavior I select L via 'calculate' (average of observed concluded lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level (using empirical lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=561 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (many 1\u20133 with average \u22482). Use lead-time 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concl. messages (captures the ~2-period actual). Demand history seed (samples mean=106.4) is unchanged \u2014 use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting OR engine set base stock given the inferred L. This balances service (accounting for the slightly longer observed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=561. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead_time = 3 (multiple orders: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P41->P44), so I set lead time explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid underordering. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (uses full history) \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline. This choice reconciles large in-transit stock and confirmed longer lead time while letting backend estimate demand uncertainty from all data.

Historical conclude messages show repeated lead_time=3 observations (confirmed at Period 18) and many delayed arrivals; therefore I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained longer transit. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (this captures demand uncertainty while the explicit L protects against under-ordering due to delayed shipments).
