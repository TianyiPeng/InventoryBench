My assessment: No concluded periods exist to contradict promised lead time or signal lost shipments; demand history shows moderate mean (~106) with some variability but no sustained shift (only 5 periods). Given high critical fractile (q=0.95) and zero pipeline, following OR keeps risk of stockout low while avoiding excessive over-ordering beyond OR's cap. Action: accept OR's recommendation rounded to their suggested 151 units to cover the next (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. This balances profit preference (high stockout cost implicit in q) against holding cost. No new carry-over insight (insufficient periods to declare sustained shifts).",
