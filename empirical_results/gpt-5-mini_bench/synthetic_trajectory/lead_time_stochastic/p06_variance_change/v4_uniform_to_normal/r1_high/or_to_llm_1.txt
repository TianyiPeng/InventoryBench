There are known lost/delayed shipments recorded in carry-over (Period 12): some past orders never concluded (143 + 25 = 168 units) so treat a material fraction of pipeline as at-risk. Inventory & demand: recent long-run single-period demand ~100\u2013120; initial 5-sample mean = 112.4 \u2192 (L+1)=4 period demand \u2248 449.6 units. Current visible stock = on-hand 101 + in-transit 688 = 789 units. Adjust for pipeline risk using prior loss fraction: historical lost 168 of in-transit 351 (~48%); applying similar risk conservatively reduces usable pipeline by ~329 units (0.48\xd7688) leaving usable inventory \u2248 460 units \u2248 expected 4-period demand. OR recommendation: OR=0 (it uses promised L and full pipeline). Decision logic: given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we bias to avoid stockouts, but visible inventory after conservative risk adjustment already roughly covers the (L+1) demand window. Nearing end of horizon (Period 46/50) and actual lead time \u22483 means new orders may arrive late relative to remaining selling periods. Therefore order a small safety refill (50 units) to protect against slightly worse-than-expected demand or additional lost pipeline while limiting holding cost risk.
