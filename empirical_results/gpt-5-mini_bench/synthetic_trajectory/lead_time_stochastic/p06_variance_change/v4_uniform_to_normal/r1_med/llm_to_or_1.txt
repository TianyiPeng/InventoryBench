Using initial samples from train.csv: /shared/share_malatown/OR-Agent-GPT5mini-benchmark/examples/benchmark/synthetic_trajectory/lead_time_stochastic/p06_variance_change/v4_uniform_to_normal/r1_med/train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 112), ('Period_2', 111), ('Period_3', 80), ('Period_4', 129), ('Period_5', 130)]
  Mean: 112.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1: no on-hand or in-transit inventory; historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) average 112.4 units. No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. Use promised lead time to avoid premature assumptions. Set L=default (promised 2). Use mu_hat=default to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, providing a 3-period forecast that covers current plus lead-time demand. Use sigma_hat=default to reflect historical variability across the 3-period demand horizon. This balances service (higher base stock from 3-period demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=146, no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order arrived=0) \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2. Historical demand samples mean=112.4 units/period (5 samples). With promised L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248337 units; current pipeline (146) is well below this, so keep L as promised and use default demand estimates so the OR engine raises order to cover the 3-period demand plus safety stock. No strong evidence yet of changed lead time or sustained demand regime (only one concluded order and normal variation in samples).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Observed no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (ordered=146+143=289 in-transit, arrived=0 in conclude messages). Cannot confirm actual lead time (no concluded arrivals), so retain promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples (Periods 1\u20135) to produce base stock. This balances service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=360 (orders from P1-P3). Three consecutive periods (P1-P3) show zero arrivals despite orders; promised L=2 appears unreliable. I set L explicit=3 to reflect extended lead time and ensure pipeline covers extra in-transit delay. Demand history mean (all samples) used with default mu_hat to scale for (1+L). Volatility unchanged (default sigma_hat) to let OR backend compute safety stock; this raises target base-stock and reduces risk of stockouts while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total 360 units) have not arrived by promised lead time=2; treat actual lead time as at least 3 periods until arrivals are observed.

Daily Profit: $580.00, Daily Holding Cost: $72.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed arrivals show at least one order experienced lead_time=3 (P1\u2192arrived P4), indicating shorter promised LT=2 is unreliable. On-hand=72, in-transit=272. Use explicit L=3 to force the OR engine to plan for longer pipeline. Demand recent history is small-sample and may include variability; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to emphasize the latest 5 samples across the review+lead period. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings bias orders upward to cover the extra delay while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent demand and overall volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_6: on-hand=6, in-transit=430, recent concluded arrivals show variable/longer lead times (P1 order arrived with lead_time=3). Several earlier orders missed promised LT=2, so set explicit L=3 to be conservative. Demand has been volatile; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (Periods 3\u20135) and avoid diluting with older data. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the latest demand while keeping volatility estimate responsive, balancing service level risk from delayed shipments against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed confirmed late arrival: order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=528; recent demand (Periods 4-6) shows volatile high/low (145,66,144). To be conservative versus promised lead time=2, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (Periods 4-6) where demand shifted; this keeps orders responsive to the recent high variability while the longer lead time buffers against further delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=1, in-transit=421, recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7)}. Evidence suggests lead time is variable and averages ~2.33; given missed/late arrivals previously and large pipeline, I use recent_N (N=3) to capture current observed lead-time average. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (captures increased lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Profit: $388.00, Daily Holding Cost: $84.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=84, in-transit=327. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (orders from P1, P4, P5), so use observed average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 4-8 = 145,66,144,128,97) better reflects current regime than the older samples, so set demand forecasts using the most recent 5 periods to capture recent volatility. These parameters trade higher pipeline uncertainty (longer avg lead time) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock from recent mean/variance.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=52, in-transit=352. Historical demand samples mean=112.4 (Periods 1-5). Observed lead times vary (1 and 3), overall average \u22482. Use lead-time estimate from observed average to align with mixed signals while the flagged delayed arrivals remain under observation. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to backend defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand and tempers extra safety stock until delayed shipments are conclusively persistent.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=429. Historical concluded lead times observed: 3 (P1\u2192P4),1 (P3\u2192P4),3 (P4\u2192P7),3 (P5\u2192P8),1 (P7\u2192P8),1 (P8\u2192P9) \u2192 average \u22482. Use calculate for L so backend uses observed average lead time. Demand samples mean=112.4; with L=2 use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to reflect 3-period coverage and default sigma_hat to reflect sample volatility. This balances service (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) by targeting the base-stock the OR engine computes from these demand stats while relying on backend caps to limit over-ordering given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=462, recent demand has been elevated and variable (Periods 7-11 demands = 128,97,118,65,146; recent mean \u2248110.8). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (orders placed P1->arrived P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). To ensure pipeline covers the longer confirmed lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and variability so the backend computes base-stock over the (1+L)-period review+lead window while avoiding overreacting to older data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time ~3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12 observations). Current on-hand=109, in-transit=308 => pipeline+on-hand=417 units. Historical sample mean demand=112.4 per period; with L=3 we must cover (1+L)=4 periods => target \u2248449.6 units, so current inventory is slightly short (~32.6 units). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and drive the OR engine to plan for 4-period coverage. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable forecast given limited demand history while accounting for longer lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5: mean=112.4) show baseline demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=385 which is below the (1+L)-period demand for L=3. Historical concludes confirm lead time=3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 arrivals). Given high service criticality (profit $4 vs holding $1 -> q=0.8) and confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3 so OR backend sizes the review+lead forecast accordingly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring orders replenish pipeline to meet 4-period demand while accounting for observed variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: recent history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (seen P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals reflect L=3. Demand recent regime (Periods 10-14 demands = 65,146,79,119,77; mean=97.2) is most relevant. I set L explicit=3 to match observed actual lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime and scale by (1+L). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. These choices signal the OR engine to target inventory covering four periods of recent demand while reflecting current variability and avoiding excess holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: recent conclues confirm actual lead time = 3 (arrivals from P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15). On-hand=0, in-transit=427. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time regime (promised=2 but confirmed 3). Demand has been ~102.8 average over last 5 periods (P11\u2013P15 = 146,79,119,77,93); to capture the most recent regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_{last5}. I also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine bases the base-stock on the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand level to balance service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead time) against holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time (confirmed in Period 12 and repeatedly thereafter). Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. Demand has recently been lower than early samples (Periods 12-16 avg \u224894.8); to capture the current regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covers Periods 12-16) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility likewise set to recent_N N=5 to reflect current demand variability. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock target with the confirmed longer lead time and the recent lower-demand regime, reducing stockouts from underestimated lead time while avoiding excessive holding costs from using older, higher-demand samples.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

No sustained demand regime shift detected (recent demands ~80\u2013145, no 3+ period change). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring safety stock covers the longer pipeline while capping orders via the backend cap to limit holding costs.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 22, on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show many 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17) with occasional 1\u20132 period exceptions. Several earlier shipments were delayed past promised L=2, and lead time was previously confirmed as 3 at Period 12. To let the OR engine quantify the observed mixed lead-time pattern, I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand forecasting I use the default aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the backend scale for the inferred lead time; this balances service level (captures longer effective pipeline) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. History shows confirmed sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, etc.). Recent demand has been moderate (~82\u2013117). To respect observed lead-time behavior and cover review+lead demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (Periods 18\u201322 demands: 82,117,99,88,80) so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of current demand while avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost. This balances service level (accounting for longer lead times) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand (Periods 19-23 = 117,99,88,80,94) appears lower/stable vs early history; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L) periods demand and keep safety relevant to current regime. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (explicit L=3 avoids unexpected stockouts from longer lead time) while using recent demand stats to limit excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical conclude messages (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17) consistently show a 3-period lead time since Period 12. To ensure orders+pipeline cover review+lead demand, I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 this scales forecasts and uncertainty for the longer confirmed lead time and helps the backend balance service level vs. holding cost given delayed arrivals.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 start. Recent history shows many periods (P19\u2013P27) with zero orders/arrivals but in-transit=472 \u2014 several earlier arrivals established actual lead time ~3 (confirmed at Period 12). To reflect that confirmed lead-time evidence while letting backend compute the best numeric L from observed arrivals, I set L to 'calculate'. Demand history samples (112,111,80,129,130) are limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples and the chosen L. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost without overfitting to short-term gaps in arrivals.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent history shows prolonged zero on-hand and large in-transit (472). Historical conclude messages (Period_12) confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods. Demand historical samples (given) have mean 112.4; with confirmed L=3 I use the explicit lead time to ensure the OR backend plans for a 4-period coverage window. I choose mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean across all samples (conservative, uses full sample set). I choose sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This combination aligns the base-stock target to the confirmed longer lead time while relying on full-sample demand statistics; it also acknowledges outstanding in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service given lead-time risk.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical conclude messages (Period 4 and Period 12) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 observations). Because arrivals are delayed relative to promised L=2, I set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand (Periods 25\u201329: 118,85,121,124,122) reflects the current regime, so I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility. These parameters bias orders to cover the longer observed pipeline delay while using the latest demand regime to avoid over/under-stocking given holding cost vs profit tradeoff.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but recent evidence (last 5 observed lead times = 3,1,3,3,3) averages \u22482.6 \u2192 I choose recent_N for L to reflect the empirically longer-than-promised lead time and to keep pipeline-aware ordering. On-hand=0, in-transit=484 which comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7mean demand from the seed samples, so I avoid inflating demand forecast. I select mu_hat=default to use the full-sample mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) so the OR backend computes demand across the review+lead period consistently; sigma_hat=default to let backend scale observed volatility by sqrt(1+L). This combination biases toward service (captures longer actual lead time) while relying on existing pipeline to limit extra ordering and holding costs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical demand samples (used by engine) mean=112.4 (Periods 1-5). Carry-over history has lead time confirmed as 3 periods. With promised=2 but confirmed=3, I set L=3 to reflect observed arrivals. Pipeline (484) already slightly exceeds (1+L)*mean demand \u2248449.6 so no aggressive up-ordering needed. Choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (uses observed longer lead time) against holding cost given existing in-transit stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows mixed but persistent multi-period delays: concluded lead times (from arrivals) are mostly 3 with some 1s and a 2; average observed lead time is best estimated from all concluded observations. On-hand=0, in-transit=484 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed historically, so infer lead time from observed concludes. I set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) so the OR engine uses actual observed lead-time behavior. For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and the historical demand samples.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=34. On-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 confirmations), and several shipments were delayed earlier, so set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201333) averages near ~110 units/period with moderate volatility; to focus the forecast on the most recent regime I use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 24\u201333). This yields (1+L)-horizon demand and variability aligned to current demand level and the confirmed lead time, helping the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost under prolonged lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical conclude messages have repeatedly shown orders arriving with 3-period delays (evidence: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 and carry-over confirmation at Period 12). Treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over available demand history, leveraging full sample history for stable demand estimate while the explicit L accounts for observed delayed arrivals.

To reflect observed lead-time behavior use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast scales with (1+L) and historical sample stats; this balances service level (accounting for longer observed LT) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and ensure pipeline coverage. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (last 10 demand periods) so the base-stock and cap reflect current ~100 demand rather than early volatile samples; this balances service (avoid stockouts given L=3 and large in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 21-40) averages ~100/unit with low volatility vs initial burst in Periods1-18. To account for confirmed longer lead time and recent stable demand, set L explicitly=3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 20 periods, improving responsiveness to the sustained ~100 demand regime while covering the longer pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical conclude messages and prior carry-over confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. To ensure pipeline covers (1+L) periods and account for delayed arrivals, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this balances service level versus holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and current large in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,7,12 etc.) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; many past shipments arrived with L=3. To ensure pipeline covers demand during review+lead, set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand (Periods 38-42 = 93,106,100,97,99) shows a stable regime ~99 units; use recent_N=5 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility. These choices account for longer realized lead time and use the most recent stable demand window to balance service level vs. holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand history shows mean ~112.4 from samples; carry-over confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=484 which roughly covers (1+L)*mean demand (with L=3). Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This aligns orders with the confirmed longer lead time and avoids over-ordering since pipeline already exceeds expected coverage.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical conclude messages (Period 4 and Period 12) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Given confirmed LT=3 and no new sustained demand regime shift, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend computes across the correct (1+L) horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples; this balances service level (longer effective lead time) against holding cost while respecting observed delayed arrivals.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been persistently 3 periods (confirmed in Period 12); treat lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. I choose L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine set the base-stock and cap given the longer lead time and observed demand history.

To ensure pipeline covers the longer actual transit and avoid stockouts, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the explicit longer lead time.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 (carry-overs: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=484 (many earlier orders outstanding). To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and avoid further stockouts, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand and volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full sample set; this keeps forecasting grounded in all observed demand samples while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and guides larger pipeline targets.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it produce a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the longer lead time and existing pipeline.
