Step 2 - Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so pipeline_inventory = 0. Step 3 - Demand assessment: Historical samples give mean \u03bc\u0304 = 134.6 units/period (samples: 204,155,134,72,108) and sample std \u2248 49.7. Recent samples show some variability but no sustained regime shift (insufficient evidence to declare a new regime). Step 4 - OR recommendation review: OR computed a base-stock \u2248 134.6 and capped the order to 135 units given promised L=0; this matches the statistical estimate and the critical fractile (profit = holding cost \u2192 q=0.5) which implies z*=0. Step 5 - Decision tradeoffs: Starting with zero on-hand, the expected single-period demand (~135) would lead to large lost sales if I underorder. Risk of overstock is symmetric to understock because profit = holding cost; with no confirmed lead-time issues or lost shipments, following OR keeps inventory aligned to expected demand while avoiding excess speculative safety stock.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order (135) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0 periods. That confirms actual lead time = promised 0 for the most recent concluded order. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any sales in Period 2 must be covered by an order placed now. Demand analysis: Historical sample mean from the provided five-sample history is \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 134.6 units/period. OR's capped base-stock recommendation is 144 units (it uses promised L=0 and its cap to smooth ordering). However, realized demand in the most recent concluded period (Period 1) was 191 \u2014 a substantial single-period spike above the historical mean (+42%). This could indicate a short-lived surge or noise; carry-over rules require 3+ periods for a sustained regime change, which we don't yet have. Policy and cost tradeoffs: profit = holding_cost, so the critical fractile q = 0.5 and OR's policy targets approximately the mean demand; holding excess inventory is as costly as lost profit from stockouts. Given a confirmed lead time of 0 (so ordered units arrive in the same period), we need to balance the risk of stockout this period (if demand is closer to 191) against the full holding cost penalty for over-ordering. Decision logic: Use OR's recommendation as a baseline but partially hedge upward to account for the recent high observed demand while avoiding full exposure to holding costs if the spike is transient. I increase OR's 144 modestly toward the recent realized demand but stop well short of matching 191 because the signal is not yet sustained. Final action: order 160 units (an increase of 16 units over OR), which gives some buffer vs. the 144 baseline while limiting downside holding cost if demand reverts to historical levels.

OR baseline (capped base-stock) produced recommendation = 93 units using its formulas and promised L=0. Analysis and decision logic: With L=0, any order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 3 demand, so we should top up toward the single-period target (\u2248135). Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 47) leaves a gap \u2248 88 units to reach the estimated mean demand. The critical fractile with Profit=Holding implies z*\u22480 (no extra safety stock beyond mean), so the uncapped base-stock target \u2248135 is appropriate. The OR cap is not binding here. Adjustment vs OR: OR recommended 93, slightly above the uncapped order_raw \u2248 88 (base_stock \u2212 pipeline).

OR uses the historical mean over all samples and a capped base-stock; with profit=holding the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0), so the OR baseline target would be near the single-period mean.

Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), so the newsvendor critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0; optimal base-stock \u2248 mean demand \u2248 112 units.\n\nStep 3 - Compare to OR recommendation: OR recommends 122 units. OR uses historical samples and the promised lead time; with q=0.5 it would also target the mean but its cap formula and rounding produce 122. Given confirmed lead time = 0, no pipeline to cover, and holding cost equal to profit (so we should avoid extra stock), I reduce the order to the estimated mean to avoid unnecessary holding cost while still covering expected demand.\n\nFinal strategy: place an order of 112 units (rounded from mean 111.6).

Given lead time is 0 and recent mean demand \u224880, OR's recommendation is more aggressive than needed and would increase holding costs (holding cost $1/unit equals profit $1/unit, so overstock is as costly as understock is costly in lost profit terms).\n\n5) Final ordering decision: Target to meet expected demand (mean) for the period: 80 units.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 26, in-transit = 0.

Recent realized demand from Periods 8\u201315 = [104, 69, 66, 85, 45, 55, 45, 46], average = 64.4 units/period. This extends the previously recorded regime shift (Periods 8\u201312) and shows the lower-demand regime has persisted through Period 15. Given product economics (Profit = $1, Holding = $1) the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0, so no safety stock is warranted under symmetric cost structure.\n\nComparison to OR: OR recommends 85 units. OR uses older history and the promised lead time; its cap and historical larger mean push the recommendation higher. Because actual demand has been persistently lower (~64 units) and lead time is 0 (so incoming inventory is available immediately), following OR\u2019s 85 would create unnecessary holding cost without increasing sales.\n\nFinal strategy and quantity: Target single-period demand \u2248 64 units.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive before demand is realized in Period 18, so I can use ordering to meet Period 18 demand immediately. Step 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 2, in-transit = 0. With L=0, pipeline_inventory = on-hand + in-transit = 2 (but an order will arrive this period). Step 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent periods show a sustained lower-demand regime vs early history. Last 5 demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [55, 45, 46, 50, 62], average = 51.6. Earlier short-run avg (Periods 8\u201312) was ~73.8 and multi-period insight through Period 16 gave avg \u224864.4 vs earlier sample \u2248134.6 (big historical drop). The most recent 5\u20138 periods point to single-period demand typically in the 50\u201365 range. Step 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 93 units (uses older history and promised lead time). Given profit=holding => critical fractile = 0.5, the optimal base-stock equals the demand mean; with recent mean \u224852, OR's 93 is too high and would create unnecessary holding cost. Step 5 \u2014 Decision logic and safety: Because lead time = 0, ordered units are available for the current period; I therefore order roughly the expected demand for the coming period rather than the higher OR suggestion. I round to a conservative, slightly precautionary quantity (60 units) to cover a possible uptick (60 is ~+16% over the recent 5-period mean 51.6 and below the 8-period mean ~64.4). This balances lost-sales risk with holding cost (holding cost = profit). Step 6 \u2014 Final action: Order 60 units. Expected on-hand after arrival = 62 units (2 current + 60 ordered), which should cover the expected demand (\u224852) while limiting end-of-period inventory.

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history shows lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over: P1..P25 all arrived same period). Therefore any order placed now will arrive during this period and be available to meet Period 26 demand (and will show in the Period 26 conclude message). There is no in-transit inventory to consider. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized demand has been well below the early-sample levels. The provided carry-over insights flag a sustained demand regime drop (Periods 8\u201315 and onward). Looking at the most recent periods (P21\u2013P25: 42, 56, 45, 34, 20) the 5-period average is \u224839.4; a 9-period average (P17\u2013P25) is \u224844.7. This supports a materially lower expected single-period demand than OR's recommendation (OR used older/historic data and the promised L). \n\nStep 3 \u2014 Cost tradeoffs & target stock: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit-period, so the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 minimal safety stock (median demand). Given high holding penalty relative to profit, we should avoid overstock that will incur holding cost. With lead time 0 we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 =1). Target on-hand for the period \u2248 expected single-period demand; using the recent 5-period average I target ~40 units on hand to meet likely demand while minimizing holding cost. \n\nStep 4 \u2014 Current inventory & order calculation: On-hand = 28, in-transit = 0. Desired on-hand \u2248 40 \u2192 order = 40 \u2212 28 = 12 units. This is significantly lower than the OR capped recommendation of 53 because OR overweights older higher-demand samples and uses its cap, whereas recent demand is persistently lower and holding cost equals profit so over-ordering is costly. \n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk considerations: If demand unexpectedly spikes back to historical highs, we may stock out this period; however, given lead time = 0 we can place more orders within the same period if needed in future periods. Because carrying costs are high ($1/unit) relative to profit, the conservative position (order 12) minimizes expected holding losses while accepting modest stockout risk. \n\nConclusion: Order 12 units to bring on-hand to ~40, matching recent demand levels while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and be available for current-period demand.\n- Demand assessment: The long-run sample mean from initial dataset is ~134.6, but historical periods have shown sustained downward shifts that were recorded previously. Looking at the most recent 8 periods (Periods 21\u201328) demand sequence = [42, 56, 45, 34, 20, 32, 32, 47], sum = 308, mean = 38.5 units/period. This is a sustained low-demand regime for at least 8 periods.\n- OR recommendation: OR suggests 77 units. OR uses older historical samples and promised lead time; with profit=holding ($1 each) OR's critical fractile is 0.5 so it effectively targets the mean over the review+lead horizon but is influenced by older, higher-demand data and the cap formula.\n- Decision logic: With lead time = 0, we can use a single-period order to meet expected current-period demand. Holding cost equals profit, so overstock is as costly per unit as stockout forgone profit; that argues for ordering close to the median/mean of current-period demand rather than large safety stock.

Because lead time is 0, there is no pipeline risk to cover; ordering 40 covers expected demand this period while minimizing holding cost.\n- Risk handling: If demand unexpectedly spikes above 40 this period we will stockout (lost sales) but holding cost equals profit so avoiding excess inventory is preferred given the clear, sustained drop in demand.

This is consistent with the earlier carry-over summary (recent avg \u2248 38.5 for Periods 21\u201328).\n- OR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 75 units. OR uses historical demand that includes higher earlier samples and the promised lead time; given profit=holding ($1/$1) its critical fractile is 0.5 so base-stock equals expected demand over (1+L) periods. OR's cap formula can produce higher orders when using older, larger-sample means.\nDecision logic and final quantity:\n- With lead time = 0 and demand concentrated around ~38 units per period, we only need to cover one upcoming period of demand (L+1 =1). On-hand and in-transit are zero, so order should equal expected next-period demand.\n- Profit and holding costs are equal, so the inventory policy should target the mean demand without extra safety stock. Given some variability in recent demand (32\u201347), rounding up slightly reduces stockouts with minimal holding penalty.\n- Therefore I order 40 units (slightly above recent mean 38.2) rather than OR's 75, to avoid unnecessary holding cost from ordering based on older, larger-demand history.\nOperational note: Because lead time is 0, this order will arrive within the same period; sales will occur after arrival. Monitor demand next periods for any reversion; if demand increases for 3+ periods, record a carry-over insight and increase orders accordingly.\n",

Demand analysis: recent realized demands show a sustained lower-demand regime vs the original sample. Using the most recent 5 periods (P28\u2013P32: 47, 34, 46, 36, 51) the mean demand \u2248 42.8 units. Longer recent windows (P25\u2013P32) give similar low averages (~38\u201343).

{
  "rationale": "Summary of observed facts: lead time is confirmed 0 periods (arrivals in concluded messages show orders arriving same period). Current on-hand = 15, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has been in a lower regime for many periods; carry-over insights note a sustained demand regime shift with recent averages around 38.5 (Periods 21\u201328) and later confirmation through Period 29+. The OR baseline recommends 57 units but uses the entire historical sample and the promised lead time; it does not account for the sustained lower-demand regime we have observed.\n\nDemand forecast and target stock: With lead time = 0 we only need to cover current-period demand (L+1 = 1 period). Using recent realized demand (most recent periods 29\u201333 and the carry-over insight average \u2248 38\u201339), a conservative single-period expected demand ~39 units is appropriate. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding), implying a critical fractile q = 0.5 (no explicit safety stock benefit), so target on-hand at order decision \u2248 expected demand \u2248 39 units.\n\nInventory reconciliation and order calculation: Target on-hand = 39 units. Current on-hand = 15, in-transit = 0. Required order = max(0, target - on-hand - in-transit) = 39 - 15 = 24 units. This minimizes expected overstock (which costs $1/unit/period) while meeting expected sales. Given lead time = 0, these 24 units will arrive in period and be available for sales this period.\n\nWhy I reduced OR's recommendation: OR's 57 is higher than the recent-demand-informed target because it uses older high-demand samples and a cap computed under different assumptions. With confirmed lower demand and zero lead time, carrying large extra stock just increases holding cost without expected extra profit. Therefore I override OR downward to align order with the sustained lower-demand regime and equal profit/holding economics.\n\nRisk considerations: If demand unexpectedly spikes back to earlier highs, we may miss some sales this period; however, lead time = 0 allows us to place additional orders immediately in the next period if needed. This choice prioritizes profit net of holding cost in the current low-demand regime.\n",

Recent realized demand (periods 27\u201334) = {32, 47, 34, 46, 36, 51, 28, 55} with average \u2248 41.1 units/period. Longer recent window (periods 21\u201334) average \u2248 41\u201342 as well. Previous carry-over insights already recorded a sustained multi-period demand decline (recent regime with averages down near 38\u201364 depending on window). Given that history shows a sustained lower-demand regime for many periods, the relevant single-period expected demand to cover (L+1)=1 period is ~41 units. \n\nOR recommendation review: OR recommends 72 units. OR uses historical samples and the promised lead time; given profit = holding cost (q = 0.5 \u2192 z*\u22480) the OR recommendation is being influenced by its cap and historical variance. With confirmed lead time 0 and the clear, sustained lower-demand regime, OR's 72 is too high and would create unnecessary holding cost.\n\nDecision logic: We must order enough so that order + on-hand + in-transit cover one period of expected demand (L+1 = 1). On-hand+in-transit = 0, so order \u2248 expected one-period demand. I choose 42 units (rounded from ~41.1) to match recent realized demand while avoiding extra holding cost. This reduces OR's 72 \u2192 42 (-30 units) in light of confirmed 0 lead time and a sustained lower-demand regime. This balances sales and holding cost under equal profit/holding rates.\n\nRisk & contingency: If demand reverts upward suddenly, a same-period lead time allows us to ramp orders immediately in the next decision. Because lead time is 0, we do not need to carry large safety stock across periods; hence keep order conservative.

Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 37 and be available for Period 37 demand (but its arrival will only be visible in the Period 37 conclude message). Demand outlook: Historical series shows a sustained downward regime vs the early high-demand periods (carry-over insights indicate multiple confirmed downward shifts). Recent realized demands (Periods 32\u201336 = 51, 28, 55, 69, 19) are noisy but the more recent longer window (Periods 21\u201336) supports a substantially lower mean than early periods; OR's cap/mean calculation does not account for this sustained lower regime beyond using all samples equally. Cost structure and service tradeoff: Profit = $1 per unit sold and Holding = $1 per unit held, so the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* = 0). That implies the optimal base-stock equals the demand mean over the review period; there is no strong justification to hold extra safety stock given equal profit/holding costs. OR recommendation: 39 units. Adjustment reasoning: With on-hand = 31 and lead time = 0, ordering the full OR recommendation (39) would raise available stock to 70 units, which risks high holding costs relative to expected incremental units sold given the observed lower demand regime.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 - Lead time & pipeline: Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders in prior periods arrived same period). Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so anything I order now (lead_time=0) will arrive during Period 39 and can satisfy Period 39 demand.\n\nStep 2 - OR recommendation: OR recommends 69 units. OR uses historical data and the promised lead time; its cap/stock formula can produce higher orders when using longer historical averages. With profit = holding cost, OR's critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0), so the OR baseline effectively targets mean demand but can be pushed up by its cap calculation over the pipeline.\n\nStep 3 - Demand analysis: Recent realized demands (Periods 31\u201338) = [36, 51, 28, 55, 69, 19, 13, 44], sum = 316, mean \u2248 39.5 units/period. Earlier history shows much higher demand, but multiple carry-over insights already recorded indicate a sustained downward regime shift. Given the most recent 8-period mean \u2248 39\u201340 and the high variability, my best single-period unbiased point estimate is ~39\u201340 units.\n\nStep 4 - Profit/holding implications: Profit per sold unit = $1, holding cost per leftover unit = $1/period. Because profit = holding cost, leftover inventory at period end negates its profit in the next period; I should avoid positive ending inventory unless I expect a material chance to sell it immediately. With lead time = 0, I can replenish next period if needed, so holding safety stock is costly and unnecessary.\n\nStep 5 - Decision rule & final quantity: Target order \u2248 expected single-period demand (recent mean) and avoid safety stock. I round to 40 units to cover the recent mean (~39.5) and small upside risk. This reduces OR's 69 to 40 based on observed lower demand and confirmed lead time = 0.\n\nStep 6 - Risk notes: If demand spikes unexpectedly this period, I will miss incremental sales but avoid holding costly leftover inventory. With lead time=0, I can correct next period.\n",

Promised lead time = 0 is confirmed in practice, so any order placed now will arrive during the current period's Arrival Resolution and be available for demand this period. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 20, in-transit = 0. Recent realized single-period demand is lower than early-period levels and volatile. Using the most recent 8 concluded demands (Periods 32\u201339: 51, 28, 55, 69, 19, 13, 44, 20) gives an average demand \u2248 37.4 units per period. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), so the critical fractile is 0.5 and OR's base-stock approach targets roughly the mean; OR recommends 47 units (uses longer historical data and its cap). Adjustment decision: Because lead time = 0, we only need to bring on-hand up to expected single-period demand. With 20 on-hand, ordering ~17 units will yield ~37 on-hand after arrival, matching the recent mean demand and avoiding excess holding cost. I therefore reduce OR's recommendation (47) down to 17 units. This balances stock availability against equal per-unit holding cost (no extra safety-stock premium justified by recent lower regime). Risk notes: Demand is variable; if demand spikes above mean this period we'll incur some stockouts, but holding cost equals profit so overstocking is costly.

Step 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: The OR baseline (67) is driven by long-run historical samples; however the observed demand has shifted materially downward and remained low for many periods (carry-over insights record several sustained regime shifts). Examining the most recent realized demands (Periods 36\u201340 = 19, 13, 44, 20, 38) gives a recent mean \u2248 26.8 units and moderate variability. Many recent periods show low single-period demand (~20\u201340). Step 3 \u2014 Risk tradeoff and cost structure: Profit = $1/unit and holding cost = $1/unit/period, so overstocking costs as much as one period's profit \u2014 we should avoid substantial positive expected ending inventory. With lead time = 0, we can respond each period, so large safety stock is unnecessary. Step 4 \u2014 Decision: Order to meet expected single-period demand rather than OR's higher long-history-driven quantity. I set order = 27 units (rounded from recent mean 26.8).

Historical demand samples show a clear, sustained downward regime versus the early high-demand periods. The provided carry-over insights indicate multiple confirmed regime shifts culminating in lower average demand (most recently: Period 21\u201328 avg \u2248 38.5 and later sustained low demand). Looking at the most recent realized demands (Periods 38\u201345): [44, 20, 38, 41, 12, 42, 1, 63] \u2192 mean \u2248 33.6 with substantial variability and occasional spikes (Period 45 had 63).

Given Profit = $1 and Holding = $1 (critical fractile q = 0.5), the policy is indifferent between stocking and not, so we should be conservative to avoid holding cost unless demand clearly justifies more inventory.\n\nDecision logic and final strategy: Because actual lead time = 0, we can respond to demand quickly and do not need pipeline cover for multiple periods. Demand regime has been lower for many periods (carry-over confirms sustained reduction), but there is nontrivial variability with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 45 = 63). To balance lost-sales risk and holding cost (equal per unit), I choose a conservative order slightly above the recent multi-period low-demand average to cover typical demand and moderate spikes. Recent sustained averages suggest single-period demand \u2248 34\u201339. Ordering 40 units gives reasonable protection against typical demand, limits holding cost if demand stays low, and preserves agility (we can top up in the same period in future because lead time = 0). \n\nAdjustment vs OR: I reduce OR's recommendation from 63 to 40 because OR overweights older high-demand history and its cap does not account for the sustained downward regime documented in carry-over insights.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 47 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 so we start exposed to stockout for Period 47 unless we order. Historical demand has shifted downward vs the earliest samples; recent periods (P39\u2013P46) demand sequence = [20, 38, 41, 12, 42, 1, 63, 43] with mean \u2248 32.5. A slightly longer window (P42\u2013P46) gives mean \u2248 32.2. OR recommends 63 units based on its capped base-stock calculation using longer-history stats and promised L; but current realized demand over recent periods is roughly half of that recommendation. Cost tradeoffs: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile = 0.5 so the optimal single-period order targets the median/mean of one-period demand; safety stock should be minimal. Strategy and final quantity: I reduce OR's recommendation to align with recent realized demand and avoid excess holding cost. Ordering ~33 units covers the recent average demand (~32\u201333) while limiting upside holding penalty if demand remains low. This also keeps us from severe stock buildup given holding cost equals profit. If Period 47 demand materially exceeds this (stockouts occur), I will use future concluded periods to update carry-over insights and increase orders accordingly. ",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows lead time = 0 periods (confirmed repeatedly through Period 47 arrivals), so any order placed now will arrive and be available in the same period's arrival resolution (but note arrivals are only visible in the conclude message next period). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has been well below the early-era highs: last 7 demands (Periods 41\u201347) = {41, 12, 42, 1, 63, 43, 25}, average \u2248 32.4 units/period. The long-run earlier mean (~134.6) is no longer representative; multiple past carry-over notes already record sustained down-shifts. OR recommendation = 54 units (uses long-run history and promised lead time). Why adjust: OR uses older data and a cap that doesn't reflect the sustained low-demand regime. Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 0.5 implies little to no safety stock (z* \u2248 0), so ordering to roughly cover expected single-period demand is optimal. I therefore target one-period demand rather than OR's higher base-stock. Order size decision: Target demand \u2248 32 units; with 8 on-hand I should order \u2248 24. To be slightly conservative given variability (and occasional spikes like 63), I round up modestly to 25 units. This keeps expected stockouts low while avoiding excessive holding cost. Final strategy: place a single-period replenishment order of 25 units (arrives this period). Monitor realized demand over the next 3+ periods; if the low-demand regime persists, continue ordering roughly single-period mean each period; if demand rises, scale orders up accordingly. ",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201348) shows every order arrived in the same period it was placed (arrived=ordered on same Period each time). Promised lead time = 0 is confirmed in concluded messages, so orders placed now will arrive during this period and be available to meet Period 49 demand.\n\nInventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so there is no coverage for today's demand. Any order placed now becomes available for Period 49 demand because lead time = 0.\n\nDemand analysis: The long-run historical samples include high values early, but multiple carry-over insights indicate several downward regime shifts sustained across many periods. Recent actual demands (Periods 41\u201348) are: 41, 12, 42, 1, 63, 43, 25, 33 (sum = 260 over 8 periods) \u2192 recent average \u2248 32.5 units/period. This recent low regime (averaging ~32\u201339 in prior recorded shifts) is sustained and significant versus earlier high means, so it should drive the next-period forecast.\n\nOR recommendation assessment: OR recommends 62 units using its capped base-stock based on historical data and promised lead time, which overweights older, higher demand samples and does not account for the sustained low-demand regime. With profit = holding = $1, the newsvendor critical fractile is 0.5, so the optimal order for a single-period facing symmetric costs is to match the expected single-period demand.\n\nDecision: Order 33 units (rounded from recent expected demand 32.5). Rationale: with lead time = 0 the order will arrive in time for today's demand; matching the recent mean minimizes expected lost-profit vs holding tradeoff given equal profit and holding costs (ordering more than ~32\u201333 risks equal or greater holding cost than profit gained from extra sales under the current low-demand regime). This cuts OR's 62 in half to align with the sustained low-demand reality and avoids unnecessary holding cost.\n\nRisk & notes: If demand reverts upward quickly, we will understock and lose sales; however multiple sustained regime-shift signals (recorded previously) make the lower forecast the conservative, higher-expected-profit choice for immediate periods. No new carry-over insight is being recorded this period (no new 3+-period sustained change beyond those already recorded).",

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any order placed now affects Period 50 demand. Demand analysis: recent realized demands over the last 8 concluded periods (P42\u2013P49) are [12, 42, 1, 63, 43, 25, 33, 49], sum = 268 \u2192 avg \u2248 33.5 units/period.
