Product is a standard snack (chips) with no obvious seasonality from the prompt. b) Demand regime: Historical samples (Periods 1-5) show stable demand: 187, 189, 158, 158, 184. 5-period average = 175.2 units; recent variation suggests typical single-period demand \u2248175 units. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT may differ; no concluded arrivals or prior shipments to infer actual lead time. Treat arrival as uncertain but assume supplier will attempt to deliver same-period (promised 0) while recognizing risk of delay/loss. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because decisions occur before arrivals, an order placed now may not be visible until a conclude message; however promised LT=0 implies possible same-period arrival \u2014 but this is not guaranteed. e) Final order logic: Expected demand this period \u2248175 units. Each unit sold yields $4 profit; holding cost is $1/unit/period for ending inventory. To maximize expected period reward while avoiding excessive holding cost, order to roughly match expected demand (avoid large overstock). Given limited historical variability and no confirmed LT issues, place an order of 175 units to cover projected period demand while keeping ending inventory risk moderate. If subsequent conclude messages show delays/lost shipments, adjust in future periods.",

This is only one-period evidence; not yet a sustained pattern. d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so all expected demand must be met by an order placed now. Orders with supplier promised lead_time=0 have arrived previously within the same period, so an order placed now is expected to arrive in-period and will serve Period 2 demand. e) Order logic: Using a newsvendor-style tradeoff: underage cost = lost profit = $4/unit, overage cost = holding = $1/unit, critical fractile = 4/(4+1)=0.8.

Observed realized demand exceeded prior seed series; the two revealed period demands average 221 units. There is no evidence yet of a structural shift beyond these high levels.\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0 observed twice). This suggests the supplier can deliver with 0 promised lead time; however this is only two periods of evidence so not yet a sustained 3+ period confirmation.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0.
