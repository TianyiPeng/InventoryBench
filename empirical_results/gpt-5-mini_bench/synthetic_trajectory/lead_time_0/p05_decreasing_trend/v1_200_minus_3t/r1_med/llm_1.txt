There is no clear trend (values fluctuate around this mean) and no evidence yet of a sustained shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: supplier promised 0 periods but we have no concluded arrivals history to confirm actual lead time; therefore orders placed now may or may not arrive within this same period. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Current period demand will occur after the decision; to avoid lost sales we should target roughly one period of expected demand. e) Final order logic: order close to the sample mean (182 units) to balance expected profit (Profit $4 \xd7 units sold) against holding cost ($1 \xd7 ending inventory). Given uncertainty about actual lead time, ordering the forecasted demand minimizes expected lost sales while limiting excess holding cost. ",

This suggests true demand for P1 exceeded supply. Lead-time vs. missing orders: Period_1 conclude shows the P1 order of 182 arrived in Period_1 with lead_time=0 confirmed for that shipment. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0 at decision time for Period_2. Forecast & order logic: For Period_2 the best unbiased forecast is the Period_2 sample (207) and recent history indicates average demand near ~182\u2013200; given the stockout in P1 I prioritize meeting demand rather than risking another lost sale. Promised lead_time=0 and we've observed at least one 0 lead_time arrival, so an order placed now will arrive in Period_2 and can satisfy Period_2 demand. To cover expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period) I order 207 units. This balances expected sales upside (Profit $4/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period).

Recent actual observed demands in concludes: Period1 demand=217 (sold 182 due to starting stock), Period2 demand=213 (sold 207). The provided sample for Period_3 is 170 and aligns with a modest downshift from the first two periods. c) Lead time / orders: Concluded messages show orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived with lead_time=0 (arrived same period). This suggests supplier can deliver same-period, but we have only two confirming periods (insufficient to record a sustained change per carry-over rules). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0.

Simple recent-average demand = (217+213+163)/3 = 197.7. Given limited data and no clear sustained regime shift, use the recent mean as the demand center. c) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 arrived in the same period (each conclude reported arrival for the same-period order).

The most recent single-period demand (P27) was low (79), but there is variability (sd evident). c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (orders placed each period arrived that same period). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (recorded earlier at Period 4) and there are no overdue or missing shipments in history. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Current on-hand = 49, in-transit = 0.

Average \u2248 89.6 units, sample SD \u2248 24 units. This is below earlier higher regimes (noting prior carry-over insights that demand dropped around Period 30). c) Lead time / orders: History consistently shows orders arriving in the same period (lead_time = 0 confirmed), and in-transit = 0 now. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 46, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed this decision phase will arrive in Period 41 before demand and thus can be used to meet Period 41 demand. e) Forecast & order logic: Forecast expected demand \u2248 90 units. To target a reasonable service level given demand volatility (SD \u2248 24), I aim to cover expected demand and add a modest safety buffer (~1 SD) to reduce stockout risk: required = 90 - 46 = 44 needed to meet mean demand; add ~24 for safety \u2192 ~68. Rounding to a manageable whole number and balancing holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs. lost profit ($4/unit sold), I order 70 units. This gives on-hand \u2248116 for Period 41 which should meet demand in most cases while keeping holding cost moderate.",
