  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: From Period 1 conclude we observed the Period 1 order (137) arrive in Period 1 with lead_time=0. That confirms at least one observed arrival consistent with the supplier's promised lead time of 0 periods. No in-transit or overdue shipments exist now (on-hand=0, in-transit=0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand inference: Historical sample mean across the provided five samples = (130+147+128+116+161)/5 = 136.4 units/period. Period 1 demand was 165 (a one-period spike) and we sold out at 137; that single spike is notable but not yet a sustained regime shift (needs 3+ periods to record). The OR baseline already incorporates historical demand and caps; with profit=holding cost, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z*=0, so the OR's base-stock essentially centers on the mean demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 142 units. This is slightly above the empirical mean (136.4) and therefore provides a small buffer for the observed spike in Period 1 while respecting the cap behavior in the OR algorithm. Given profit and holding costs are equal, we are cost-indifferent between one unit sold and one unit held, so a small upward bias to avoid repeat stockouts is reasonable.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final decision logic: With promised/observed lead time = 0, orders placed now arrive within the same period (and will be visible in the conclude message next period). We have zero on-hand and zero pipeline, and one-period demand to cover. I therefore accept the OR recommendation (142 units) to reduce the chance of a repeat stockout after the 165 demand observation while not materially increasing holding-cost risk because holding cost equals profit per unit.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Carry-over considerations: No sustained demand regime shift (only one high-demand period) and lead-time confirmation is based on a single observation, so no carry-over insight is recorded per the conservative 3+ period rule.",

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so any order placed now can arrive in the same period and be used to satisfy Period 3 demand. Demand analysis: OR recommends 142 (based on historical samples and promised lead time). Recent realized demands in the conclude messages are 165 (Period 1 demand) and 145 (Period 2 demand), average = 155, which is notably above OR's baseline and above the historical-sample mean (\u2248136). With lead time = 0 we can respond immediately to higher realized demand. Cost tradeoff: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit-period, giving a critical fractile of 0.5 (neutral). That implies ordering near the median/mean demand is appropriate. Given two recent periods of higher demand, I bias the order upward from OR to better capture sales and avoid stockouts while avoiding excess holding (since holding cost equals profit). Final decision: increase OR's recommendation from 142 to 155 units to better reflect the recent realized average demand of 155 and the confirmed 0-period lead time allowing same-period fulfillment.

Promised lead time = 0 and actual lead time = 0 imply we only need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand from order + on-hand.\n\nStep 3 - Review OR recommendation: OR suggests 121 units; OR is implicitly using a longer historical sample and its capped logic. OR's base-stock (with q=0.5) targets roughly the single-period mean (~148) but cap and different sample likely produced 121. With on-hand 20, ordering 121 would give starting coverage of 141, slightly below recent mean (~148).\n\nStep 4 - Final strategy and order quantity: I increase the order slightly above OR to target one period of expected demand (\u2248148).

With lead_time = 0, any order placed now will arrive before demand in this same period, so we only need to cover one upcoming period of demand (L+1 = 1).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Recent realized demand (most relevant) has been higher than the OR's older-sample-driven suggestion. Using the last 5 selling periods (Periods 5\u20139) demand = {144, 145, 170, 133, 124}, mean = 143.2 \u2248 143 units for a single period.

Empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 136.4 units/period and empirical std is nonzero, but with profit = holding = $1 the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0. Thus the OR base-stock target (\u03bc\u0302 for (1+L)=1 period) is \u2248136.4 units.

To reach the base-stock level \u2248136.4, required order \u2248136.4 \u2212 on-hand(37) = 99.4 units.

Conversely, understocking forfeits profit on missed sales. Targeting the mean demand (base stock \u2248136) minimizes expected regret under q=0.5. The OR recommendation (101) is acceptable but slightly higher than the precise reach-to-base-stock calculation given current on-hand; I reduce it to avoid unnecessary holding cost.\n\nFinal strategy: Place order of 99 units so on-hand + arrival (37 + 99) \u2248 136 units, matching expected single-period demand.

Decision: I will accept the OR recommendation and order 69 units.

Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), so the critical fractile is 0.5 and we should target roughly the median/mean single-period demand to balance stockouts vs. holding.

This means any order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 20 demand.\n- Inventory state: On-hand = 26, In-transit = 0. With L=0, pipeline_inventory effectively equals on-hand (26) for setting a same-period base-stock.\n- Demand outlook: Recent demand (Periods 15\u201319) = [146, 109, 120, 130, 106] \u2192 mean \u2248 122.2 units. The longer-run sample provided earlier (Periods 1\u20135) had mean \u2248136.4, but the recent 5-period mean is a better indicator of current regime and is materially lower than the early-sample mean, so I rely on the recent mean.\n- OR baseline: OR recommends 105 units. OR uses full history and promised lead time; its cap and base-stock logic tends to smooth recommendations. OR\u2019s 105 is modestly below the recent mean (122), likely because it pools older higher-demand samples.\n- News about costs & critical fractile: Profit = $1, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0. With q=0.5 the base-stock target equals the expected demand over (L+1) periods. For L=0, base_stock \u2248 single-period mean.\n\nDecision math and final action:\n- Use the recent-period mean demand \u2248122 as the base-stock target (aligns with q=0.5). With pipeline_inventory = on-hand = 26, order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory \u2248 122 \u2212 26 = 96 units.\n- This brings available inventory (after arrival) to \u2248122, matching expected demand and minimizing expected ending inventory (holding cost) while capturing expected sales (profit). Ordering 96 is slightly above OR's 105 recommendation? Actually OR=105 is a bit higher than 96; I choose 96 to match recent mean and reduce holding cost risk given symmetric profit/holding costs.\n\nRisks and mitigations:\n- If demand reverts to the earlier higher mean (~136), we may understock occasionally; however recent five-period demand supports the lower target and we have same-period lead time (can respond next period). Because lead time = 0, we can rapidly adjust next period if demand spikes.\n\nConclusion: Order 96 units so that arriving stock \u2248122 (26 on-hand + 96 ordered) to meet expected Period 20 demand and minimize expected ending inventory cost.",

Empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 136.4 units/period, sample sd \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 17.64.

Therefore any order placed now will arrive during Period 34 and can satisfy Period 34 demand.\n- Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline to cover current demand.\n- Demand evidence: Recent periods since the documented regime shift show substantially lower demand than early history. Calculating recent demand (Periods 25\u201333): 98, 94, 106, 88, 67, 97, 63, 57, 80 \u2192 sum = 750, mean = 83.3 units/period. The carry-over insight already notes a sustained drop around Periods 25\u201329; extending the window to Periods 25\u201333 gives an even lower recent mean (\u224883). Variability is moderate but the OR baseline uses all historical samples (which are biased high) and therefore overestimates.\n- Cost tradeoff and OR policy: Profit = Holding cost ($1 profit, $1 holding) \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5, meaning order should target the mean demand for the coverage period. With lead time 0, coverage period = 1, so target \u2248 recent single-period mean (~83). OR recommendation (116) is higher because it uses older higher-demand history and its cap/stock calculation; following it would increase expected holding cost without much increase in sold units given the demand drop.\nFinal decision logic and quantity: Order enough to meet one period of expected demand given confirmed lead time 0 and the sustained lower-demand regime. I therefore order 83 units (rounding the recent mean 83.3 down slightly to avoid extra holding cost since profit and holding cost are equal). This minimizes expected overstock while matching the recent realized demand level.\nAdjustment vs OR: Reduced OR's 116 \u2192 83 because OR overweights older high-demand data; lead time = 0 implies no pipeline buffer is needed for future periods beyond the current one.\nOperational note: If demand in the next 2\u20133 periods shows a rebound (sustained higher demand for 3+ periods), switch back to a higher stock level.

Recent demand has fallen and the environment already recorded a sustained regime shift at Period 30 (Periods 25\u201329 avg \u224890.6 vs earlier \u2248136.4, ~33% drop). More recent single-period demands (Periods 30\u201334) = [97, 63, 57, 80, 80], average = 75.4 units; this suggests the current single-period mean is closer to ~75 rather than OR's implicit larger mean.

Recent realized demands (Periods 30\u201336) are: 97, 63, 57, 80, 80, 94, 80 \u2192 average \u2248 79.9 units/period. This lower regime has persisted across many periods, so it is the best indicator for near-term demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation review: OR recommends 114 units (uses promised L=0 and historical samples without recency weighting). OR's base-stock/cap approach can over-order when past high-demand samples dominate; with equal profit and holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1), the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0) so recommended stock should be centered on mean \u2014 but the OR used older samples leading to a larger number than recent realized demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Policy decision and trade-offs: Because lead time = 0, we can react each period to observed demand; there is no need to pre-build large pipeline. Ordering too many units now creates holding cost that directly offsets profit (profit and holding cost equal). The recent 7-period average (~80) is a reliable short-term forecast; ordering roughly that amount maximizes expected Profit\xd7sold \u2212 Holding\xd7ending_inventory. To be slightly conservative against demand variability (recent std is moderate) but avoid excessive holding, I set the order below OR's 114 to 80 units.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action summary: Order 80 units now.

Recent realized demand has shifted down from early-period levels; the carry-over insight (Period 30) documented a sustained drop (Periods 25\u201329 avg \u224890.6 vs initial mean \u2248136.4).

  "rationale": "Summary of observations and inference:\n- Lead time: Carry-over insight (Period 4) and every conclude message show orders arriving same period they were placed \u2014 actual lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and will be available for demand this period (but will only be visible in the conclude message next period).\n- Inventory/pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline cover; we must order for (L+1)=1 period of expected demand.\n- Demand outlook: The history shows a clear, sustained downward regime established around Periods 25\u201329 (carry-over insight): recent 5-period average \u224890.6 vs earlier mean \u2248136.4 (~33% drop). The latest five demands (P35\u2013P39 = 94, 80, 108, 77, 101) average \u224892 with sample SD \u224813.3. This lower-demand regime has persisted for many periods and is already recorded as a carry-over insight, so we treat it as the working demand level.\n- OR recommendation: OR recommends 113 units. OR uses the full historical sample and the promised lead time, and its cap pushes toward a higher order (it effectively targets ~95th percentile of single-period demand). Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the optimal base-stock given a correct mean is to order the expected one-period demand without extra safety stock.\n- Risk trade-offs: Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding). Over-ordering above expected demand directly increases holding cost at the same magnitude as additional profit per unit sold \u2014 because each extra unit stocked that isn\u2019t demanded incurs holding cost equal to the profit it could have earned, making aggressive overstocking unattractive. With lead time = 0, we can refresh every period, so little reason to carry safety stock unless we want to avoid stockouts within the period; but safety stock costs as much as its upside.\nDecision and computation:\n- Use recent 5-period mean \u2248 92 as the best current estimate for next-period demand.\n- With q = 0.5 (no safety stock) and lead time 0, order = expected one-period demand = 92 units. This directly replaces OR's higher capped recommendation because OR's cap is influenced by older, higher historical demand; the environment has shifted downward and lead time = 0 allows us to run-to-demand without holding excess inventory.\nImplementation note:\n- Order 92 units now; it will arrive during this period and satisfy current-period demand. Monitor sales this period; if demand rebounds for multiple consecutive periods (\u22653), update carry-over insights and scale orders upward. If demand falls further, reduce orders accordingly.\n",

There are no in-transit units and on-hand = 0, so any order placed now will arrive in the current period (then demand will be realized after arrival).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: The long-run historical samples (Periods 1\u20135) show higher demand, but Period 30 carry-over insight already identified a sustained regime drop (Periods 25\u201329 avg ~90.6 vs earlier ~136.4). Recent actual demands (Periods 37\u201341 = 108, 77, 101, 86, 95) average \u224893.4 units/period, consistent with the lower-demand regime (~90\u201395). Variability exists, but the lower mean appears sustained.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation vs. reality: OR recommends 112 units. OR uses a base-stock with a safety factor derived from profit/(profit+holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z*\u22480, so its base_stock \u2248 estimated mean over (1+L) periods. With actual L=0 and recent mean \u224893.4, the OR recommendation of 112 is higher than the recent observed mean and would create unnecessary holding cost given profit and holding cost are equal.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final ordering decision: With lead time = 0, no pipeline, and demand expectation ~93\u201394, ordering to cover roughly one period's expected demand is appropriate. Because profit = holding cost (critical fractile 0.5), safety stock is not justified beyond the point estimate. To hedge modest variability and rounding, I will order 95 units (slightly above the recent mean of 93.4). This reduces holding cost risk relative to OR's 112 while keeping stock to meet expected sales.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Implementation notes: Order = 95 arrives this period; monitor subsequent periods for any reversion of demand or new lead-time evidence.

Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 19, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has been lower than the initial sample mean; looking at the most recent 6 periods (Periods 37\u201342) demands = [108,77,101,86,95,76], average \u2248 90.5 units/period. The OR recommendation is 92 units (it uses promised lead time and historical samples). Policy comparison: With profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0, so the base-stock equals the expected demand (no extra safety stock). Given confirmed L=0, we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. Order decision: target single-period expected demand \u2248 90.5. Subtract on-hand 19 \u2192 order \u2248 71.5. Rounding to whole units and being slightly conservative to avoid unnecessary holding cost, I order 72 units. Rationale for deviating from OR's 92: OR's 92 is close to the expected demand but does not consider the current on-hand (19) sufficiently in its capped recommendation; ordering 92 would raise inventory and incur extra holding cost with no additional expected profit because q=0.5 implies no safety buffer is optimal. Final strategy: order 72 units so that expected available inventory for this period \u2248 91 (19 + 72), matching recent demand \u2248 90.5 and minimizing holding cost risk.

There are no in-transit units. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 15, in-transit = 0, so current available inventory if we place no order = 15.

Earlier carry-over insight already recorded a sustained drop vs Periods 1\u20135; recent five-period average is consistent with that lower regime (\u224887\u201391 range). No evidence of a new upward spike or seasonality requiring extra stock. \n\nStep 4 \u2014 Cost tradeoffs & OR baseline: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5, so the theoretical safety factor z* = 0 (no extra safety stock beyond mean).

The provided carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0. Therefore orders placed now will arrive during Period 45 and be available for Period 45 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: The OR baseline uses older historical samples and produced a capped order of 107. However demand has shifted down since the early periods (carry-over insight from Period 30 shows a sustained ~33% drop). Recent realized demands in Periods 40\u201344 are: 86, 95, 76, 76, 84 \u2192 recent average \u2248 83.4 units/period.

With lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 45 demand. The decision should target (L+1)=1 period of demand coverage. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), giving a critical fractile of 0.5 and effectively no safety-stock bias (z*\u22480). That argues ordering close to the expected single-period demand rather than OR's larger capped amount.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final calculation and strategy: Using the recent single-period demand forecast \u224883.4, required incoming units \u224883.4 \u2212 on-hand(3) = 80.4. To be conservative and keep whole units, I round to 81 units. This balances meeting expected demand (minimizing lost sales) while avoiding excess holding cost given profit=holding. I therefore order 81 units, overriding OR's 107 recommendation downward because of confirmed lead time=0 and a sustained lower-demand regime.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk note: If demand unexpectedly spikes back to OR's historical mean (\u2248136), this order will understock; but given the confirmed demand drop across many periods and equal profit/holding costs, minimizing overstock is preferable.

With lead time = 0, an order will immediately add to on-hand for the upcoming demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Long-run early-period mean was high (~136), but a sustained regime drop was already captured in carry-over insights (Periods 25\u201329 avg \u2248 90.6). More recent single-period demands (Periods 41\u201345 = 95, 76, 76, 84, 31) average \u2248 72.4; the last period's demand of 31 looks like an outlier rather than a new sustained drop because prior four periods are in the mid-70s to mid-90s. Given profit = holding cost ($1 / unit), critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 we should be risk-neutral re: stockouts vs holding; avoid large overstock because holding cost penalizes excess equally to profit foregone.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 55 units.

Set target on-hand \u2248 80 units. With current on-hand 53, order = 80 \u2212 53 = 27 units. This reduces OR's 55 to 27 because: (a) confirmed lead time = 0 so we can top up exactly to target, (b) recent 5-period avg \u224872 indicates lower sustained demand than the long-run early mean, and (c) holding cost equals profit so avoiding overstock is important. \n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk notes & monitoring: If we observe several consecutive periods with demand >>80, we'll increase orders; if demand stays at or below recent averages, this smaller order preserves profit by lowering holding cost.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4 and every concluded period shows same-period arrivals). Therefore any order placed now will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution (after decision) and will be available for demand this period; arrivals will be visible in the next period's conclude message. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 37, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has shifted down from early-sample highs; the most recent five-period demand (Periods 42\u201346 = 76, 76, 84, 31, 43) averages 62 units per period, indicating current single-period expected demand \u224862. OR recommends 70 units based on historical data and its capped base-stock calculation; however OR does not account for the recent sustained drop in demand and the current confirmed lead time=0. Strategy and final quantity: With lead time = 0, I only need to cover this period's demand plus a small buffer. I will order to bring available inventory up to the expected single-period demand (62) rather than OR's 70. Required order = max(0, expected_demand \u2212 on_hand) = max(0, 62 \u2212 37) = 25 units. Rationale summary: (1) Use recent demand (avg \u224862) rather than older higher means; (2) lead time=0 makes immediate replenishment effective so no extra pipeline needed; (3) holding cost equals profit (1:1) so excess inventory is costly to hold per period, and with only a few periods remaining in the horizon we should avoid overstock. Therefore place an order of 25 units.",

{
  "rationale": "Summary of observations and inference:\n- Lead time: Concluded periods (Period 1\u201347) continue to show arrivals same-period as orders; carry-over already recorded lead time = 0 (confirmed). So orders placed now will arrive during this same period (but will only be visible in the conclude message next period).\n- Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline cover for current-period demand.\n- Demand evidence: Historical demand (Periods 1\u20135 provided earlier) showed higher values, but we have observed a sustained downward regime starting around Period 25 (previous carry-over insight: avg 90.6 for Periods 25\u201329 vs earlier ~136.4). More recently demand has fallen further: Periods 45\u201347 demands = 31, 43, 63 (3 most recent periods), average = 45.7 units/period. The 5-period window 43\u201347 average = 59.4 units/period. This is a substantial drop relative to the earlier post-shift average ~90.6.\n- OR recommendation: OR capped policy recommends 106 units using all history and the promised lead time. Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile is 0.5 (no safety stock from OR\u2019s fractile), but OR\u2019s cap calculation and long history cause a higher suggested qty.\n- Decision logic: With profit = holding cost, overstock is expensive (holding cost per unit per period equals profit). Lead time = 0 means ordered units can serve current demand, so we only need to cover expected single-period demand (L+1 =1). Recent realized demand has been much lower than the OR\u2019s long-history-driven recommendation. Because on-hand is zero and there is no pipeline, we must order now to meet expected demand this period, but we should be conservative to avoid incurring holding costs on slow-moving inventory.\n- Final action selection: I choose 60 units. Rationale for 60: it sits between the recent 5-period average (\u224859.4) and the 3-period very-recent average (\u224845.7). This covers expected demand this period with a small buffer, while avoiding the high exposure implied by OR\u2019s 106 units which reflects older, higher-demand history. Given lead time = 0, this single-period order is sufficient; avoid large safety stock because holding cost equals profit.\n- How this adapts OR recommendation: I reduce OR\u2019s 106 \u2192 60 to reflect confirmed zero lead time, zero pipeline, and a clear sustained downward demand regime (recent average much lower). If actual demand in the coming periods re-accelerates, we will observe it from concluded periods and can raise orders next period (lead time 0 allows quick response).\n",

No pipeline to cover current demand.\n- Costs: profit = $1.0/unit, holding = $1.0/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0. So safety stock suggested by newsvendor logic is zero for symmetric costs; base-stock = expected demand over (L+1)=1 periods.\n- Demand evidence: Historical early periods average ~136 (Periods 1\u20135) but carry-over insights record sustained regime drops. Recent realized demands: Period 45=31, P46=43, P47=63, P48=72. The prior recorded regime shift (Periods 45\u201347) gave avg \u224845.7; including P48 raises the recent 4-period average to (31+43+63+72)/4 = 52.25 units/period. This is a sustained and large reduction vs older history; therefore my best current forecast for one-period demand is approximately 50\u201355 units.\n- OR recommendation: 106 units. OR uses older historical samples and promised lead time; it doesn't account for the verified, large, sustained drop in demand. With lead time = 0 and no pipeline, OR's 106 would create unnecessary holding cost (holding cost = profit), so overstocks are costly.\nDecision logic and final quantity:\n- With L=0 and q=0.5, the optimal one-period order \u2248 expected one-period demand. Using recent average \u224852.25, I round conservatively to 55 units to protect lightly against variability (period-to-period demand still shows occasional spikes to 72). Ordering 55 units will arrive this period and likely cover demand without creating excessive holding cost.\n- This is a reduction from OR's 106 to avoid overstock given the confirmed lower-demand regime and 0 lead time (no need to prebuild pipeline).\nRisk management:\n- If demand unexpectedly reverts upward, we can increase orders in the next period because lead time = 0 and there is no pipeline delay. If demand stays low, ordering 55 avoids paying holding cost on large excess inventory.\n",

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive before demand this period. Demand analysis: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 45\u201349) = [31, 43, 63, 72, 59], average \u2248 53.6. Earlier carry-over insights recorded a large sustained drop from earlier highs; the most recent 5-period mean (\u224853.6) is still far below the original Periods 1\u20135 mean (~136) and consistent with the post-shift lower-demand regime. Cost structure & OR baseline: Profit = $1/unit and Holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 safety factor z* = 0, so the optimum base-stock equals the expected demand over (1+L) periods (here just the single-period mean). OR recommended 105 units using older historical stats and its capping rule; that is materially higher than recent realized demand and would create unnecessary holding cost given equal profit and holding cost. Action decision: Order to match current best estimate of single-period demand (rounded). I choose 54 units (rounding 53.6 \u2192 54) to cover expected demand this period while avoiding extra holding cost. Rationale tie-back: With lead time = 0, orders arrive immediately and we do not need pipeline cover beyond this period; given symmetric cost (profit = holding) and recent sustained lower-demand regime, ordering the recent mean minimizes expected regret from overstocking vs stockouts.
