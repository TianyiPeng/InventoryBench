No evidence of a sustained shift or trend in the provided history (only 5 periods).\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time. There is a risk actual lead time >0 or a lost order, but no evidence to mark a persistent delay.\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Because promised lead_time=0, an order placed now should arrive this period (if supplier honors promise). Given demand will occur after decision, we should order to cover expected current-period demand plus a small safety buffer to avoid stockouts, balancing holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs. high profit ($19/unit sold).\ne) Final order logic: Use the historical average demand (~136 units) as the primary forecast and add a modest safety buffer to protect against variance while keeping holding costs low.

However Period 1 observed demand=165 (sold 140 due to stockout), a single higher observation that could indicate higher demand but is not yet a sustained regime change. c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 conclude shows ordered=140 arrived=140 with lead_time=0 periods (ordered on Period 1, arrived same period). This indicates the supplier can deliver within-period for that order. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0; no overdue orders. Because lead_time=0 was observed, an order placed now will arrive during Period 2 and can be used to satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Order logic: Lost sales are costly because profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1/period). Given the high profit and low holding cost, and the recent observed demand of 165 (and historical average ~136), I will target coverage for the higher observed demand to avoid stockouts. Since orders arrive in-period (lead_time=0), we don't need extra pipeline coverage.

Earlier documented regime shift at P30 lowered long-run mean vs P20s, but recent data show some rebound toward ~89, so I use the recent 7-period mean as the primary forecast. Lead time & pipeline: lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period), and there are currently 19 on-hand and 0 in-transit, so any order placed now will arrive before demand in Period 43. Decision logic: aim to cover expected demand while allowing a modest buffer for variability. Target on-hand before demand \u2248 100 units (roughly mean + ~1 SD) to reduce stockout risk; this balances high per-unit profit ($19) against modest holding cost ($1/unit). Required order = target 100 \u2212 current on-hand 19 = 81 units. This order should maximize expected profit from sales while keeping holding costs reasonable.",
