Use the historical mean (\u2248315) as a demand forecast for the upcoming period while recognizing upward trend. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown. We have no concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time; shipments could arrive same-period (L=0) or later. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Because holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, excess inventory carried forward gives no expected net benefit; we should avoid large overstock. However, under-ordering risks lost sales if actual lead time is 0. e) Final order logic: Balance the risk of missing current demand vs. costly holding. Using the historical average demand \u2248315 units (captures recent higher-demand regime) is a reasonable single-period target. Order 315 units to aim to meet one period's expected demand now; this keeps inventory exposure limited while capturing likely sales if the order arrives promptly. If future conclude messages show delayed/lost arrivals, adjust lead-time inference and reduce future orders accordingly.",

Recent observed demands in conclude messages: P1 demand=134, P2 demand=225, P3 demand=338 \u2014 also an increasing trend. The most relevant short-term forecast for Period 4 is the Period_4 sample demand = 376 (and recent actuals support a substantial upward trend). c) Lead time / missing orders: Conclude messages for Periods 1-3 report arrived=ordered with lead_time=0 for each period, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

This represents a sustained increase: average of early 3 periods (P1-3) = 219 units, average of late 3 periods (P3-5) = 406 units (+85% vs early). Concluded game history (periods 1\u20134) also shows rising sells: 134, 225, 338, 316, consistent with an upward trend. c) Lead time / missing orders: Period 4 carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (orders placed arrive same period). No in-transit inventory and no overdue shipments present. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 60, In-transit = 0. With actual lead time = 0, any order placed this decision phase will arrive in Period_5 before demand is realized and therefore can be used to satisfy Period_5 demand. e) Final order logic: Because profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1, leftover inventory is costly and we should avoid overstocking. Given the strong multi-period upward demand signal and the historical Period_5 sample of 544 units, plan to supply expected demand rather than only recent lower averages.

The late-3 average (P3\u2013P5) = (298+376+544)/3 = 406 units; this aligns with the confirmed demand regime increase noted in carry-over. Recent single-period noise (P4 lower than P5) is plausible but the sustained upward baseline supports planning around ~406 units for next period. c) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded history shows all orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 each concluded order); use lead_time=0 for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 65, In-transit = 0, so available before demand = 65. Because lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive in Period_6 and can satisfy Period_6 demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit/unit = $1, so carrying inventory into future periods erodes profit heavily. Thus avoid excess safety stock. e) Final order logic: Target to meet forecasted Period_6 demand (~406) while minimizing ending inventory. Order = max(0, forecast - on-hand) = 406 - 65 = 341 units.

No special calendar events provided. b) Demand regime analysis: Recent realized demands show a steady upward trend: P25=2309, P26=2427, P27=2565. Growth between P25->P27 is consistent (~+5\u20136% per period). Use most recent periods to forecast next-period demand. c) Lead time / pipeline: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Current pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no incoming supply. d) Inventory & cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/unit/period. Holding erodes the entire unit profit each period, so we should avoid carrying significant ending inventory. With LT=0 we can order to closely match expected Period 28 demand. e) Final order logic: Forecast Period 28 demand by extrapolating recent trend. Using increments (P25\u2192P26 = +118, P26\u2192P27 = +138; average +128) projects demand \u2248 2565 + 128 \u2248 2693. A percent-growth approach (\u2248+5.6%) gives \u22482705. To meet demand while minimizing ending inventory (since holding cost equals profit), order to satisfy expected demand with a small conservative buffer would be suboptimal because buffer creates costly holding.
