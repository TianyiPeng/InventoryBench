Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_1. Demand history shows a clear, sustained upward shift (samples: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544). On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to avoid stockouts. No concluded arrival messages are available yet, so there is no empirical evidence to change the promised lead time; use default lead time to avoid overfitting to missing data. Because demand has risen substantially in the most recent periods, I bias estimates toward the recent regime by using the last 3 samples for mean and volatility (captures the sustained increase starting Period_3). Profit = $4 and holding = $1 imply a high service-level target (q = 0.8), so using recent higher mean increases the base-stock recommendation to avoid costly lost sales while sigma estimated on recent data reflects current volatility. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances responsiveness to the new higher-demand regime against stability given limited data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period_3: prior avg (Periods 1-2) = 179.5, recent avg (Periods 3-5) = 406.0 (+126%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 context: observed Period 1 conclude shows a 0-period actual lead time for the order placed in Period 1. Historical demand samples indicate a clear upward regime (samples: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544) with the most recent three periods averaging ~406 units. Current inventory: on-hand=378, in-transit=0. Profit per unit is $4 and holding cost $1, implying a high target service quantile (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) so we should favor availability over minimal holding. Given the confirmed recent demand uplift (sustained in the most recent samples) I choose to forecast using the most recent regime to avoid understocking: set L to default (use promised lead time), mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated recent mean (this yields (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples), and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders conservative enough to meet higher demand while the high profit/holding ratio pushes the OR engine toward a higher base-stock; current on-hand (378) already covers much of one period's expected demand (~406) but not fully, so the backend will top up toward the calculated base-stock.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 decision. Demand context: historical series shows a clear, sustained upward regime starting Period 3 (Periods 3-5 mean = 406 vs Periods 1-2 mean = 179.5, +126%). On-hand = 300, in-transit = 0 (no shipments outstanding). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20132 show actual lead_time = 0 in both cases, so no evidence of delay or lost shipments. Given the confirmed regime shift beginning Period 3, I use a recent-regime forecast to reflect the higher demand. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (which currently average 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (the recent regime length: Periods 3\u20135, mean = 406 units) so mu_hat targets the new, higher mean demand over the review+lead horizon. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=3 to capture the increased variability in the new regime (sample std of Periods 3\u20135 \u2248 126 units). This configuration prioritizes service (profit/holding ratio = 4/(4+1)=0.8 implies a high target quantile) while keeping orders responsive to the confirmed demand jump. With on-hand=300 and no pipeline, the backend\u2019s base-stock calculation on these parameters will order to cover the higher regime demand and avoid stockouts while still accounting for holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1207.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Recent history shows sustained higher demand regime beginning Period 3 (already recorded). Current on-hand = 145, in-transit = 0; no arrivals pending and next-period demand will occur after this decision, so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand in pipeline. Lead times observed in concluded messages for Periods 1-3 are all 0 \u2014 consistent with promised lead time. To keep the OR engine aligned with the confirmed fast fulfillment, I set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 0). Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 3; to capture the higher recent mean I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (focusing the forecast on the new regime). Volatility also appears driven by the new regime, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to service the elevated demand while the confirmed zero lead time minimizes the pipeline horizon, balancing higher service level (profit preservation) versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2->P2, P3->P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1261.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: recent demand has shifted up sharply (Periods 3-5 avg = 406 vs Periods 1-2 avg = 179.5). On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. Given the sustained regime change starting Period 3 (3 consecutive higher-demand periods) I use a recent-window demand forecast to reflect the new higher mean and volatility. L: keep default promised lead time (confirmed as 0 in history). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=3 (captures Periods 3-5 average = 406, so (1+L)*mean reflects current high-demand regime). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=3 to reflect increased variability in the recent high-demand regime. This choice raises the base-stock target to avoid stockouts under the new regime while sigma_hat raises safety stock to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff; keeping L=default leverages the confirmed zero lead time so orders can arrive same period and minimize unnecessary pipeline stock. With on-hand=3 and no in-transit, this will instruct the OR engine to order up to a higher base stock appropriate for the new demand level to preserve service and profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1376.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals in P1-P5 matched same-period orders). Demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period_3 (Periods 3-5 show much higher demand than Periods 1-2). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals show no delay. For demand forecast I use the recent regime (Periods 3-5) where the higher mean is sustained: choose recent_N with N=3 (regime length = 3). Using the recent 3-period mean for mu_hat captures the elevated demand and helps the OR backend set a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect the increased variability in the new regime. This balances higher service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by biasing toward more inventory given the clear +126% demand shift observed since Period_3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1812.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for orders P1-P6 all show arrived same period => actual lead time confirmed 0. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period_3 (Periods 3-6 demands: 338,316,479,616). To keep the OR backend responsive to the higher recent demand, I set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach focused on the confirmed higher regime: N=4 (Periods 3-6) to capture the post-changepoint mean; mu_hat will thus reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples. Volatility is also set using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service level (capture elevated mean and variability) against holding cost by not inflating estimates with older, lower-demand periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision. Recent demand has shifted up and accelerated since Period 3 (sustained). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 so we must cover demand for the current period plus lead time. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (0). For demand I detect a sustained higher regime starting Period 3 and use the most recent regime (Periods 3-7) to forecast: recent_N with N=5 (Periods 3-7) captures the current elevated mean and rising trend while keeping the sample window large enough to smooth noise. Using recent_N for sigma (N=5) ensures variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service level given zero on-hand and confirmed zero lead time, while keeping sigma tied to recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock and holding cost.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples show a sustained upward regime beginning Period_3 (Periods 3-8: 298,376,544,616,687,800) \u2014 much higher than Periods 1-2. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders placed have consistently arrived same period). Given the clear regime shift and zero observed lead time, I set lead time via 'calculate' (backend will compute average observed lead time = 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 3\u20138). This (1+L)-scaled recent mean will reflect current elevated demand and avoid dilution by the low pre-change samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 so safety stock reflects the recent volatility. Rationale vs. costs: profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high service target (q ~0.8) so raising the base-stock to cover the new regime reduces stockouts; using recent samples avoids over-ordering relative to the recent trend while keeping holding cost reasonable. The chosen parameters ensure pipeline+on-hand planning covers the (1+L) review+lead period with demand estimates anchored to the confirmed higher regime.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 decision. Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 3 (Periods 3-9 show sustained higher demand vs Periods 1-2). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage; no overdue shipments evident (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). I set L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (all concluded lead times = 0) to confirm same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 3-9) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when forming (1+L)\xd7mean for the review+lead demand forecast. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. Using recent regime statistics focuses the base-stock policy on current higher demand, avoiding understocking given zero on-hand/in-transit while keeping holding cost in mind because the OR engine will combine profit vs holding to set safety stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_3 (Period_3-10 demand samples: 338,316,479,616,687,800,943,1021) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods including current period demand. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Profit/holding ratio (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) implies a relatively high service target. I select L using 'calculate' so the backend confirms lead-time from observed concluded arrivals (expected ~0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (the recent high-demand regime from Period_3 through Period_10; regime length=8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples, capturing the new higher baseline. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute the exact base-stock and cap given profit/holding tradeoffs and observed lead-time.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201311) consistently show arrived units with observed lead_time=0 each time, confirming same-period arrivals and no lost shipments recently. Demand has risen and stabilized at a higher regime starting Period_3 (carry-over note): recent realized demands (Periods 3\u201311) are substantially larger than early-period levels, so I base forecasts on the recent regime. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend infers the observed lead time from concluded history (will be 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (covering Periods 3\u201311) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; this focuses the base-stock calculation on the new mean and volatility rather than diluting with the low early-period values. This choice balances service level (by sizing around the recent higher mean) against holding cost (by not inflating the forecast with excessively long lead-time buffers since lead time is 0).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period_3 (demands large and stockouts common) and lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods. Given zero pipeline and no arrivals visible this period, we must replenish to cover the elevated recent demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals historically. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period_3 onward (long enough to smooth short-term noise but responsive to the regime shift). Using the same recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat captures recent volatility around the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid lost sales in this sustained high-demand environment while using recent data to prevent overstock from older low-demand periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 3 (Periods 3-13 average much higher than Periods 1-2) and all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0. Given the sustained upward demand (regime from Period 3 through 13, length = 11), I set lead time based on observed data and use recent data for demand forecasts. L: use 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time = 0. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=11 (covers Periods 3-13) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 11 samples, capturing the elevated demand regime rather than diluting with the low initial two samples. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=11 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This choice increases the base stock to meet the higher, sustained demand and sets safety stock based on recent variability; since holding cost is modest ($1) relative to profit ($4), prioritizing service (via recent-data-based base stock and safety stock) helps maximize profit\xd7units_sold while controlling holding cost from unnecessary excess driven by older low-demand periods. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift beyond the confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Periods 1\u201314 arrived in the same period (lead time=0 confirmed). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained growth through Period 14). To avoid stockouts givenProfit=$4 vs Holding=$1 (service-level target high, q=0.8 -> large z), I set lead time to default (promised lead time = 0, which matches observed concluded arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N on the most recent sustained high-demand regime to capture current elevated mean and volatility. I choose N=12 (Periods 3\u201314 constitute a 12-period high-demand regime; using last 12 samples balances recency and sample size). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using the current high-demand mean and its volatility, which reduces stockouts while the holding cost penalty remains accounted for by the backend's q-based service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4664.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16. Recent demand is in a high, sustained regime: the last 5 realized demands (Periods 11\u201315) = [1194, 1137, 1381, 1326, 1672], mean = 1342 units. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must order to cover immediate demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (every concluded order arrived same period), so I use the calculated average lead time (will be 0). To capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5). This biases the base-stock toward the recent higher mean (\u22481342) and uses recent volatility to size safety stock, which balances the $4 profit per unit against $1 holding cost under the OR engine's service-level mapping. Using recent_N=5 avoids diluting the forecast with much lower earlier periods while still providing a modest sample for variance estimation.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3 (previously recorded). All concluded periods (1\u201316) indicate actual lead time = 0 and steady high demand; current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage for Period 17 demand. I keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate focusing on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 12\u201316) to capture the elevated demand regime and recent variability; N=5 is chosen because the high-demand regime is well established and the last 5 samples provide a balance between responsiveness and noise. sigma_hat is also set recent_N with N=5 so the backend measures volatility from the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to match current high demand while letting the OR engine compute the service-level (q = profit/(profit+holding)) tradeoff; using recent data avoids understocking from older low-demand samples. No overdue shipments or lost orders are apparent.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every order arrived same period ordered). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (earlier carry-over insight). To respect the confirmed zero lead time, set L to default (promised). For demand forecast use the recent high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201317): regime length=15, so use recent_N with N=15 to let the backend compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 15 samples). Use the same recent_N (N=15) for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the current regime. This raises target base-stock to match sustained higher demand while keeping holding tradeoffs explicit to the OR engine (profit/holding will set safety factor). No evidence of lost shipments or new changepoints since last insights.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time reliably 0. Demand history shows a sustained regime shift beginning Period_3 (higher-demand regime from Periods 3-5 in the historical seed and sustained in later periods). To be responsive to the higher recent demand while remaining conservative about variability, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0, consistent with observed concludes). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated recent regime (this focuses the backend on the most recent high-demand samples rather than the long-run mean diluted by low early samples). For demand volatility I also use recent_N with N=3 so the safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices help the OR backend increase target base stock to meet the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost pressure in check by limiting the horizon to the recent high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7124.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demands have been large and rising (Periods 15-19 demands = 1672, 1518 start earlier, 1542, 1687, 1793, 1986) indicating a sustained high-demand regime versus the small-sample early-history. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently. I therefore keep L as the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages across many periods confirm same-period arrivals. Given the clear, sustained elevation in demand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand periods and avoid diluting the estimate with much lower early samples; this increases the base-stock to meet current demand and reduce stockouts. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance history. These choices steer the OR backend to a higher target inventory (higher \u03bc\u0302 and an empirical \u03c3\u0302 from recent data), which raises service level (reducing lost sales) while the holding cost ($1/unit) is moderate relative to profit ($4/unit), so prioritizing availability is appropriate given zero observed lead time and current stockouts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. All concluded history (Periods 1-20) shows actual lead time = 0 repeatedly; on-hand = 1, in-transit = 0, so no overdue shipments. Historical demand samples provided show a clear, sustained upward regime starting Period_3 (prior avg P1-2 = 179.5 vs recent P3-5 = 406, +126%) which persists in later concluded periods (demands have remained high through Period 20). To keep the OR engine responsive to the higher-demand regime, I set L to the promised/default (0) and use recent_N for demand parameters to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime. I select N=3 for recent calculations because the changepoint regime length in the provided sample set is 3 periods (Periods 3-5), and per rules N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 3. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat concentrates the base-stock on the higher mean and higher volatility observed in the new regime, which increases service level (reducing lost sales) while the OR backend will cap orders to moderate holding cost exposure given the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent demand has been high and rising; last 5 observed demands (Periods 17-21) = 1687, 1793, 1986, 1875, 1995 (mean \u2248 1867). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover next period's demand and preserve service. Lead time history (concluded arrivals) consistently shows 0 periods; use the promised/default lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid diluting the forecast with much lower early-period data. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility, which raises the base_stock and reduces stockouts while keeping holding costs reasonable given Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1 (service level target implied by q=4/(4+1)=0.8). This balances higher service (reduce lost sales) with holding cost by focusing on the most recent demand regime rather than the long-run average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7912.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: recent history shows a clear, sustained higher-demand regime that began around Period_3 and has persisted through Period_22. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so there are no arrivals pending or overdue shipments to reconcile. All concluded periods (P1\u2013P22) show actual lead_time = 0 consistently, so I will trust the promised lead time this period. Demand has trended upward and the most relevant information for immediate ordering is the recent realized demand (reducing overweighting of very early low samples). I choose L.method = "default" to use the promised lead time (0), mu_hat.method = "recent_N" with N=5 to base the base-stock on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 18\u201322 average \u2248 1973 units; with 1+L=1 this targets that recent mean), and sigma_hat.method = "recent_N" with N=5 to capture recent variability. These choices keep the OR backend focused on the current high-demand regime and limit carryover influence from the much lower early periods, improving service rate while controlling holding costs given the product's $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1-23) consistently show arrivals same period as order \u2192 confirmed same-period fulfillment. Demand history shows a clear upward regime since Period_3 (previous carry-over noted). Recent demands (Periods 19-23 = 1986,1875,1995,2218,2449) are materially above long-run mean, so I bias the forecast to recent data to avoid stockouts. I therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) so the OR backend treats review+lead as 1 period; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so (1+L)*mean reflects current high-demand regime and reduces expected lost sales; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. This choice raises base-stock and the cap appropriately to prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory by using only the most recent 5 periods for variance and mean.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently through Period_24, so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand history shows a sustained regime shift starting Period_3 (Periods 3-5 avg >> Periods 1-2) and that higher-demand regime persisted in later periods; to keep safety stock aligned with the higher recent demand I base demand forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect confirmed zero lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the recent high-demand regime (Periods 3-5 evidence); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock driven by recent mean demand while keeping holding cost in check by using a short, recent window rather than the long-term mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9054.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages (orders from P1..P25 all arrived same period), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 1995, 2218, 2449, 2460, 2309) shows a stable high regime vs early periods; the last 5 periods form a reasonable recent regime to forecast next-period demand. On-hand = 182, in-transit = 0 \u2014 far below expected single-period demand (~2.29k), so we must signal the OR engine to target a high base-stock. I choose L = default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances service level (reduce stockouts given high profit $4 vs $1 holding) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than the long-run mean which would understate demand. The OR backend will compute base_stock = mu_hat + z*\xb7sigma_hat and cap; using recent statistics helps avoid chronic under-ordering given the clear regime shift to higher demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9687.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in multiple confirms) and demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3. Current on-hand=21, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and confirmed actual L=0, incoming during this period would arrive same-period but will only be visible in next conclude. I set L to 'default' to trust the promised lead time (supported by many concluded arrivals showing 0). Demand regime: a large, sustained step-up beginning Period 3 (earlier carry-over insight recorded). To reflect the current high-demand regime and prioritize avoiding stockouts (profit per unit $4 vs holding $1), I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent data from the current high-demand regime. Regime length since Period 3 through Period 26 is 24 periods; capped N at 20 per rules, so N=20. This makes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples (backend computes) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 20 samples. This biased recent estimate increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand and keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff. Given on-hand 21 and no pipeline, the OR engine will order up to the computed base stock (capped by its cap) to restore availability and capture high profit while the recent_N sigma accounts for variability to avoid frequent stockouts. No new lost-shipment signal present, so no explicit lead-time extension is used.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Demand has settled at a much higher regime since Period 3 (sustained). Recent realized demands (Periods 23-27) average ~2442 units/period. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must order to cover the current high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; no evidence of lost shipments. I set L to default (promised = 0) to match confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the OR backend on the most recent stable high-demand regime (Periods 23-27), letting the backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*\xb7\u03c3 and apply the capping rule. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the safety stock reflects recent volatility. This combination prioritizes service (profit/holding q=0.8 implies high fill-rate) while avoiding overstating demand from older, lower-demand periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201328) consistently show lead_time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period) so actual lead time remains confirmed at 0. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_3 (previously recorded), so overall demand is elevated. Given the sustained confirmation of lead_time=0 and the provided historical demand samples, I choose the default methods so the OR backend uses the promised lead time and all provided samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std. This delegates exact base-stock and cap calculations to the OR engine, which will factor the high service-level implied by profit $4 vs holding $1 (q=0.8) to keep stock high enough to capture sales while the holding cost moderates overstock. No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time shifts requires an explicit L override.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 (earlier carry-over noted). Latest concluded periods show very large demands (periods 10\u201329 routinely in the thousands). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to meet ongoing high demand. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. To capture the sustained high-demand regime and avoid chronic understocking, I use a recent-window forecast for mean and volatility that emphasizes the most recent 20 periods of demand (captures the high regime while smoothing short-term noise). This balances the high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by giving the OR backend an elevated base-stock (higher mu_hat) and an empirical sigma (sigma_hat) based on the recent high-demand sample, improving service while keeping holding-cost sensitivity via the backend's q calculation.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent across many concluded periods). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime established earlier (carry-over insight recorded previously). Given zero observed pipeline and high profit-to-cost ratio (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 target service level q=0.8), use the backend defaults which compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. L set to default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) so the backend will size orders to cover current-period demand with a bias toward higher service levels; default mu_hat/sigma_hat let the OR engine apply its statistical safety-stock formula while avoiding manual overreaction to recent period-to-period noise. This balances maximizing units sold (profit) against holding costs while acknowledging no in-transit stock is available and arrivals are same-period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period through Period 31). Recent demand has been on an elevated, rising regime; the last 5 concluded-period demands (Periods 27-31) = [2565, 2733, 2915, 2866, 3137], mean \u2248 2843.2. With profit=$4 and holding=$1, critical fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 high service level desired. No overdue or lost shipments to reconcile (no in-transit). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (rising demand) and provide the OR engine with an up-to-date target ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability and let the OR backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the same 5 most-recent samples. These choices prioritize service (given high profit/low holding) while keeping volatility anchored to the most recent observed regime so orders won\u2019t under- or over-react to older, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11462.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33. Current on-hand=126, in-transit=0. Profit per unit=$4, holding cost=$1 so target service quantile q=0.8 (high service). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders from P1..P32 all arrived same period). Demand history shows a sustained regime increase starting Period_3 (earlier carry-over): recent periods (Periods 13\u201332) exhibit much higher demand than Periods 1\u20132. To reflect the sustained, higher demand regime I set L to the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time and there are no lost shipments. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (regime length >>20). This makes the base-stock reflect the current high mean demand over the review+lead window and increases safety stock appropriately for the 0-period lead. Given low on-hand and zero in-transit, using recent data avoids underordering from older low-demand samples and balances the profit-driven high service target against holding costs through the OR engine's cap. If arrivals begin to delay or shipments disappear, I will switch to explicit L and update carry-over insights.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 decision. Current context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in earlier carry-over). Recent demand has been high and elevated vs early samples; the most recent 5 periods (P29\u2013P33) demands = [2915,2866,3137,2897,3332], mean \u2248 3029 units, indicating the elevated regime continues. No overdue or missing shipments visible (arrivals have concluded each period). To match the OR engine's base-stock calculation while prioritizing service (profit $4 vs holding $1 favors higher fill rate), I choose: L=default to use the promised lead time of 0 (backed by multiple concluded arrivals showing 0); mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 \u2248 1*3029); sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. Using recent_N for both demand parameters focuses safety stock on the current regime and prevents dilution by early low-demand periods, which helps balance stockouts (lost profit) vs holding costs given profit>holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (orders in P1..P34 all arrived same period). Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period_3 (user carry-over: recent avg Period_3-5 much higher). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) since actual lead time has been consistently 0. For demand forecasts I focus on the recent, higher-demand regime rather than diluting with the small early low-demand samples: I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 20 periods of demand variability and mean. Choosing N=20 follows the guideline N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) because the post-changepoint regime is long (>20). This raises the base-stock to meet current demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock using recent variability. This balances profit-driven service (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost by basing reorder targets on the current high-demand regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201335) consistently show arrivals same period as order \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 0 in prior carry-over. Demand has settled at a higher regime vs. early periods (recent demands in Periods 31\u201335: 3137, 2897, 3332, 3213, 3490) so I base demand forecast on the most recent data. Choices: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of most recent 5 periods) so the OR engine targets stocking for current demand levels; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility and avoid underestimating variability. These parameters prioritize service (capture high current demand) while sigma_hat and the OR engine cap will limit excessive one-period overordering and control holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201336) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrive same period). Demand has moved to a much higher regime (sustained, multi-period high demand since Period 3 and especially in recent periods where demands ~2.9k\u20133.7k). Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by history, so use default lead time. To capture the recent high demand level I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 observed demand periods) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and volatility\u2014this focuses the base-stock on current demand regime rather than on older low-demand samples. With profit $4 and holding $1 (q\u22480.8) the backend will target a high service level; using recent demand stats reduces stockout risk while avoiding excess safety stock based on outdated low-demand history.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 update: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) across many periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_3 (higher mean since Period_3). Given the long, sustained higher-demand regime (Period_3 onward) I bias forecasts to recent data. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise \u2014 N=20 is the cap per rules and matches the long recent regime. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand and increases safety stock to avoid stockouts (which are costly given $4 profit per unit). Using recent_N for sigma_hat increases the backend's safety margin to balance service level vs holding cost given current high demand and immediate replenishment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed at 0 periods (consistent across many periods). Recent demand is substantially higher than earliest samples \u2014 I rely on the most recent data to capture the current regime. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0. For demand forecasting I select recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the (1+L)-period mean and variability of the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the sustained high-demand regime observed since Period_3 and the upward trend in later periods). This keeps base stock keyed to current demand while the cap limits extreme orders; it balances the relatively high profit ($4) against holding cost ($1) by using recent demand to avoid persistent understocking while not overreacting to single-period spikes. Given on-hand and in-transit are zero, this recent-based forecast helps the OR engine compute an order to cover immediate demand (L+1 periods) with appropriate safety stock.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history (Periods 1-39) consistently shows actual lead_time = 0 each period, so I trust the default promised lead time. Demand has a clear upward regime over the long history; recent periods (roughly Periods 20-39) show a sustained high-demand level (~2,000\u20133,800 units) well above early-period values. To make the base-stock responsive to the current high-demand regime while keeping variability measured from the same window, I use recent_N on both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (last 20 demand observations). This gives the OR backend a forecast that reflects the recent high mean and volatility and keeps safety stock aligned with current demand, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.8 -> relatively high service target). Using default lead time (0) ensures the backend expects same-period arrivals as historically observed. No in-transit inventory to reconcile; ordering to the recent-based base stock will rebuild on-hand to cover expected demand and safety stock, minimizing lost sales while limiting excess holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13444.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Demand context: recent demand is high and growing; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) = [3748, 3643, 3371, 3792, 4106] \u2192 recent mean \u2248 3732 units. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must cover current-period demand after decision. Lead time behavior: historical conclude messages (Periods 1-40) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0; lead time is confirmed as 0 and reliable. Profit = $4, Holding = $1 => critical ratio q = 4/(4+1)=0.8, so the OR backend will target a high service level. To avoid stockouts given very high recent demand and zero pipeline, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. I choose recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to the latest trend. This keeps base_stock high enough to meet the elevated demand (reducing lost sales which are costly relative to holding cost) but uses a short recent window to adapt if demand declines. No overdue shipments or lost orders detected.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand is high and has been elevated for many periods. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period) so use promised/default L. I detect a sustained high-demand regime in the most recent 5 periods (Periods 37-41 demands = 3643, 3371, 3792, 4106, 4110; recent mean \u2248 3804). Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1 implies q=0.8 (high service level), so we should size replenishment around the recent elevated mean and its recent variability. Therefore: L="default" to keep lead-time as promised (0); mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid lost sales given high profit) against holding cost by relying on recent demand stats rather than older, lower-demand history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43. Context: chips(Regular) profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages for Periods 1\u201342 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and a sustained demand upshift beginning at Period_3 that persists through the most recent periods. No shipments appear overdue or lost. Given the clear, persistent higher-demand regime and zero observed lead time, I will use the promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent data to capture the current elevated demand level. I choose recent_N with N=20 (capped by the guideline) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 20 demand samples, which helps the base-stock target follow the recent high-demand regime while keeping safety stock scaled to recent volatility. This balances service level (high profit per unit encourages filling demand) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand behavior rather than diluted older low-demand data.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in P1..P43 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_3 and remains elevated through Period_43. With no pipeline and confirmed zero lead time, we need to order to cover current-period demand. I choose L='default' to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the mean on the most recent high-demand periods (captures recent trend while smoothing short-term noise). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent sample window. These choices give the OR backend a demand estimate tuned to the sustained high-demand regime and a volatility estimate reflecting recent variance; using recent data limits overstock from old low-demand periods while the 0 lead time lets the system replenish for the same-period demand, balancing service level (profit $4) against holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15240.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 context: recent demand is at a sustained, elevated regime (Periods 40-44 demands = 4106, 4110, 4421, 4046, 4388; recent mean \u2248 4214). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so there are no arrivals expected this period and no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Periods 1-44) consistently shows actual lead time = 0, so use promised/default L to keep OR backend aligned. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime (capturing the last 5 periods where demand is stable and high). Using recent_N reduces understock risk given high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) by increasing the base-stock toward current observed demand; sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility in this regime for appropriate safety stock. This balances higher service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost by basing the base-stock on the most relevant recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand is very high and growing (Periods 41-45 demands = 4110, 4421, 4046, 4388, 4407; recent average \u2248 4274). Promised lead time is 0 and historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=0, so use the default promised lead time. Because demand has a clear upward regime and the last 5 periods are the best predictor of immediate future demand, set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) to size the base stock to current demand; similarly use recent 5-period volatility for sigma_hat to capture current variability. This choice ensures the OR backend targets a high service level appropriate to profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overstating older, lower-demand periods. With zero on-hand and zero pipeline, the OR engine will order toward the recent-demand-driven base stock; using recent_N for both mu and sigma makes the policy responsive to the sustained high-demand regime and avoids accumulating excessive inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time=0 confirmed in earlier carry-over), and recent demand has settled at much higher levels (Periods 37-46 demands ~3603\u20134466, with Periods 41-46 averaging ~4288). To avoid stockouts given zero pipeline and very high recent demand, I bias the forecast toward the most recent regime. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 demand samples, capturing the current high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to any single period. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent variability. This balances service level (high profit per unit = $4) against holding cost ($1) by anchoring to the latest sustained demand pattern and letting the OR backend compute the safety stock via the profit/(profit+holding) quantile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17556.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (all observed lead times = 0), so actual lead time is 0. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_3 and remains elevated through Period_47; recent demand is larger and more volatile than the early sample set. No overdue or in-transit shipments to account for, so we must order to cover immediate period demand. Choice of parameters: L -> calculate to lock actual observed lead time (avg observed = 0). mu_hat -> recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand periods (captures current high-demand regime while limiting influence of early low-demand periods). sigma_hat -> recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing. This combination ensures the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to current elevated mean and volatility while keeping lead-time consistent with confirmed arrivals, balancing service level (profit-driven) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than older low-demand data.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit=$4/unit, holding=$1/unit/period. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods confirmed), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent demands ~3,700\u20134,800), so I bias the forecast to recent history rather than the long-ago low demand samples. I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility while smoothing short-term noise. Using recent_N with a 20-period window (max sensible cap) raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand; this increases service level given zero lead time and eliminates stockouts while keeping holding cost in check by using the OR engine's cap. This balances the high profit per unit (favors service) against holding cost by reflecting current high demand and measured recent variability.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (carry-over insight already recorded: shift starting Period_3). Last 5 period demands (P45-P49) = [4407, 4466, 4468, 4822, 5048], average \u2248 4642 units. Profit $4 vs holding $1 gives q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 high service level (favor stocking to avoid lost sales). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes consistently confirm lead time 0. I choose L = default to use the promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime; mu_hat thus reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 samples (~4642). For volatility I'll use recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the same recent window, ensuring safety stock reflects recent variability. These parameters prioritize service (given high profit) while avoiding excessive holding by using a recent-window estimate rather than the much lower long-run mean.
