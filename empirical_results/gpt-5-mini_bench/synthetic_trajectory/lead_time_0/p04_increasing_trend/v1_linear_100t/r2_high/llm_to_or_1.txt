Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show increasing demand: [107, 252, 298, 376, 544] (mean = 315.4, sample std \u2248 161). Promised lead time is 0 and no evidence of longer or variable lead time yet. To let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps using its standard statistics, use default methods so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) with L as the promised lead time. This balances service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost using the backend's q = profit/(profit+holding) formulation. No shipments are overdue and no sustained changepoint is detected from only five periods, so keep defaults.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 context: On-hand = 435, in-transit = 0. Last period (Period 1) an order placed on Period 1 arrived same period (arrived=581, lead_time observed=0). No overdue or missing shipments to signal lead-time increases. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean \u2248 315.4 units (samples: 107,252,298,376,544) and substantial dispersion (std \u2248 144). Given the observed on-hand (435) plus no pipeline, and no sustained changepoint in demand or lead time, I will use the default, data-driven settings so the OR engine computes the base-stock over the 1-period review+lead window. This balances service level (using the full-sample mean and variance) against holding cost; it avoids overreacting to the single-period realized demand of 146 in Period 1 which conflicts with the provided historical series.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Visible state: on-hand=384, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals from Periods 1 and 2 show orders placed in those periods arrived in the same period (arrived statements: lead_time=0 for orders from Period 1 and Period 2). This provides direct evidence that actual lead time is 0 so far. Demand historical samples (provided) show an average demand ~315.4 units; given promised lead time=0 and concluded lead-time evidence, I select L based on observed lead times to let the OR backend trust current on-time deliveries. I use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set (captures the higher recent demands) while keeping parameterization simple. These choices keep the base-stock tied to the overall sample mean/variance (raising target inventory to meet recent higher demand) while relying on the confirmed 0 lead time to avoid extra pipeline safety stock that would increase holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6838.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Historical concluded lead times for chips(Regular) are all 0 periods (P1, P2, P3 arrivals reported with lead_time=0). Current inventory: on-hand=154, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Period_1..5) have mean \u2248315.4 units/period and std \u2248144.0. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments; no sustained changepoint in demand (only a rising trend but not yet flagged as sustained beyond 3+ periods). Given confirmed lead time = promised (0) and no strong recent regime shift, use default methods so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std and set base-stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding ($1). This keeps decisions consistent with observed zero lead time, uses full historical demand to smooth recent variation, and avoids overreacting to short-run fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7998.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: on-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1-4 all show arrivals in the same period (lead_time=0). Demand samples (environment): [107,252,298,376,544] show a clear upward trend and a recent higher regime in the last 3 samples. Given confirmed same-period arrivals in history, I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend confirm actual lead time (expected = 0). For demand (mu_hat) I choose recent_N with N=5 to capture the full available sample set while reflecting the sustained upward trend; with L=calculated as 0 this yields mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 5 samples). For sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the backend computes volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This configuration: - Uses confirmed short lead time (keeps safety stock low) - Uses recent demand average to increase target base-stock to match the clear upward demand regime - Keeps default volatility to avoid underestimating variability, balancing service level (profit per unit high relative to holding cost) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2->P2, P3->P3, P4->P4); Demand regime shift confirmed: avg(P1-2)=179.5 vs avg(P3-5)=406 (+126%), sustained over last 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $9572.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and a sustained demand regime shift: recent demands (Periods 3-5) are much higher than Periods 1-2. Current on-hand = 61, in-transit = 0, so available stock must cover Period 6 demand immediately. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (Periods 3-5) so the base-stock reflects the recent elevated mean. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent variation rather than diluting with the much lower early-period variance. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts in the new regime while keeping holding cost consideration via the backend's z* tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10431.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 decision. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward: Periods 3-6 = [368, 426, 507, 636], showing a sustained higher-demand regime versus early periods. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1-P6 arrived within the same period), so I trust lead time = 0. I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4, periods 3-6) to capture the new high-demand regime and its variance rather than diluting with low early-period demand. L set to calculate so backend confirms the observed lead time=0. mu_hat recent_N with N=4 yields (1+L)*mean(last4) which centers the base-stock on current elevated demand; sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 captures volatility in the new regime to set safety stock appropriately. This combination prioritizes service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) while limiting excess holding by not using the much lower early-period average. Given profit >> holding, the OR engine will target a high service level; using recent data avoids understocking in this higher-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11684.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: confirmed same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 in concluded history P1\u2013P7) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 3. Recent realized demand (concluded) shows higher mean since Period 3: Periods 3\u20137 demands = 368, 426, 507, 636, 618 (note Period 6 sold=549 due to stockout but demand reported 636). On-hand = 58, in-transit = 0, so available coverage is low going into Period 8. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=5 (regime length = Periods 3\u20137 = 5 periods) to capture the new, higher-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples will bias ordering toward the elevated demand. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects the higher variability in the new regime (including the large spike in Period 6). These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost considerations via the backend's q-based service level and the capped order calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13376.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start. History shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals observed same period through Period_8). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime: Periods 6-8 demands = [636, 618, 775], average \u2248 676, well above early-period averages. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 so we must replenish for immediate demand in this same-period-arrival environment. I set L = default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I focus on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=3 (the last 3 periods) to capture the elevated mean and volatility; N=3 is chosen because the regime change is recent and sustained over the last 3 periods. These parameters steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock level (covering (1+L) periods) to reduce stockouts given much higher recent demand, while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability so the cap and safety stock scale appropriately versus holding cost ($1) and profit ($19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15542.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_10. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P9 concluded same period), so promised lead time = 0 is confirmed and reliable. Demand has clearly shifted upward: initial regime (P1\u20132) avg=179.5, earlier shift around P3\u20135 gave avg=406, and the most recent periods P6\u2013P9 show a further sustained increase (see carry-over). Because arrivals occur same-period, we must cover only the current period demand when ordering (L=0 implies (1+L)=1). To respond to the recent higher-demand regime while keeping holding costs low, I use a recent_N forecast focusing on the most recent consistent regime (P6\u2013P9, 4 periods). This targets the OR engine's base-stock around the current elevated mean and uses recent volatility for sigma to set appropriate safety stock. This balances service level (profit $19 high vs holding $1 low) by letting the backend compute z* from profit/(profit+holding) while feeding it a recent mean and volatility that reflect the sustained increase in demand. No overdue shipments are present (arrivals have been timely).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg(P3-5)=406 -> avg(P6-9)=715 (+76%), sustained over 4 periods (P6\u2013P9).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 decision. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P10 arrived same period). Demand has shifted up starting Period 6 and remained high: Periods 6\u201310 demands = [636,618,775,831,993], recent 5-period average \u2248 770.6 units. Given zero observed lead time, use promised lead time (default L=0). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (changepoint at Period 6) I set demand forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 6\u201310) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 5). Volatility should also be estimated from the same recent window to capture increased variability, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. This choice ensures the OR backend targets a base stock sized for the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock aligned with observed variance; using recent data avoids dilution from the much lower early-period demand and helps prevent stockouts given current zero lead time and zero pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: demand has stayed high for several periods (Periods 6\u201311). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover current elevated demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). Demand regime: P6\u2013P11 show a sustained higher mean vs P1\u2013P5. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to capture the current high-demand regime (use the most recent 6 concluded demand periods, P6\u2013P11) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L) * mean(last 6 samples). I also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the much higher realized demand (reduce lost sales) while allowing the backend's cap and service-level math (q from profit/(profit+holding)) to balance holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P12) show every order arriving same period \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand jumped at Period 6 and has remained high through Period 12 (P6\u2013P12 demands: 636,618,775,831,993,1136,1302) \u2014 a sustained high-demand regime. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current regime (periods 6\u201312), so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 7 samples. This keeps the base-stock and cap responsive to the elevated demand while leveraging confirmed zero lead time to avoid over-ordering for transit. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level; using recent data prevents dilution by earlier low-demand periods and reduces stockouts while controlling holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time = 0). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6. Current on-hand = 147, in-transit = 0 \u2014 far below recent demand levels, so we should target the recent high-demand mean to avoid lost sales. Lead time: use promised/default (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. Demand forecast (mu_hat): use recent_N on the most recent sustained regime (periods 6\u201313) where demand averaged 933.25 units/period (8 periods). This captures the confirmed elevated demand and avoids diluting with earlier low-demand periods. Volatility (sigma_hat): use recent_N over the same 8-period regime to reflect current variability (std \u2248 240). These choices tell the OR backend to set a substantially higher base stock aligned to the high-demand regime; given profit $19 vs holding $1 (q\u22480.95) the backend will pick a high service-level z, which is appropriate because stockouts are costly. Using recent_N for both mean and sigma balances service-level targeting with current variability and acknowledges no in-transit cushion (in-transit=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed and extended: avg(P6-13)=933.25 vs avg(P3-5)=406 (+129%), sustained over 8 periods (P6\u2013P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 every concluded period). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 6 (P6\u2013P14 high demand sustained). Profit/holding implies a high target service level (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0-period lead time. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent sustained regime (P6\u2013P14, length=9) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 9 samples \u2014 this captures the new higher-demand regime while smoothing over short-term noise. This choice balances high service level (given high profit) with holding cost by basing base-stock on recent elevated mean and realized volatility rather than older lower-demand samples. No overdue or lost shipments are visible (arrivals have been confirmed each period).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every order P1\u2013P15 arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 6. I set L using observed lead times to ensure the OR backend treats lead time as 0 this period. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 6\u201315) because carry-over evidence shows a sustained regime (10 periods) with a much higher mean; this captures the current elevated demand level and volatility for the backend's base-stock and cap calculations. With profit $19 vs holding $1, the implied service quantile is very high (~0.95), so using a recent window prevents underordering from an outdated low-demand sample while limiting excess inventory by not over-weighting older low-demand periods. On-hand + in-transit is currently tiny relative to current demand (~1032 avg per period), so the policy must replenish aggressively to avoid lost sales given the high profit per unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 extended: avg(P6-15)=1031.9 vs avg(P3-5)=406 (+154%), sustained over 10 periods (P6\u2013P15).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Lead time history (Periods 1\u201316) shows every order concluded same-period => actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand regime shift beginning Period 6 is sustained through Period 16: recent demands (P6\u2013P16) average ~1082 units/period (11 samples) vs pre-shift ~406. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because lead time is reliably 0, orders arrive same period and there is no pipeline; we must cover this elevated per-period demand immediately. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) to reflect reliably observed 0 lead time. For demand sizing I use recent_N over the last 11 periods (P6\u2013P16) to capture the new high-demand regime while avoiding dilution by pre-shift data; N=11 is the detected regime length. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=11) ensures the backend measures variability from the same recent regime. These choices give the OR engine a mu_hat tied to the elevated recent mean (so base-stock responds to higher demand) and a matching sigma_hat to set safety stock appropriately; default L avoids overstating lead time and keeps orders timely, balancing service level (avoid lost sales) vs holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. On-hand=47, In-transit=0. Historical concludes show every order from Period 1\u201317 arrived same-period, so actual lead time is confirmed 0 \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (multiple prior carry-over notes). To capture the sustained elevated demand I use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime window (Periods 6\u201317, length=12). Therefore: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat -> recent_N N=12 to set (1+L)*mean over the last 12 demand samples so the backend targets supply for the current high-demand regime and raises the base stock/safety stock appropriately. sigma_hat -> recent_N N=12 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This choice balances service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding cost favors higher fill) against holding cost by tailoring both mean and std to the confirmed high-demand regime rather than diluting with early low-demand periods. No overdue shipments present (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time correction is required.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Recent history shows a sustained, higher demand regime starting at Period 6 (many periods of elevated demand through Period 18). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) demand. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0 (P1->P1 ... P18->P18), so use default lead time (0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach focused on the confirmed high-demand regime that began at Period 6. Regime length from Period 6 through Period 18 = 13 periods, so I set N=13 (N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using the last 13 demand samples captures the elevated mean and variance while avoiding dilution by the much lower P1\u2013P5 values. This raises mu_hat to reflect the new normal and sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility; together they push the OR base-stock higher to reduce lost sales while the holding cost ($1/unit) is small relative to profit ($19/unit), so prioritizing service is appropriate. No concluded arrivals are outstanding, so no need to adjust L for delays or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33172.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=78, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0 for all past orders (P1->P1 ... P19->P19). Demand has experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 6 and continuing through Period 19 (multiple previous carry-over notes confirm a large, persistent increase). Given the clear, sustained higher-demand regime from P6 onward, I set L to default (promised 0). For demand quantity and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201319) to capture the new higher mean and variability; regime length = 14 periods so I choose N=14. This biases the OR backend's base-stock toward the elevated demand while keeping lead-time assumptions optimistic/accurate (0). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the backend compute a base_stock and cap reflecting the post-changepoint demand level, balancing higher service (profit per unit $19) against holding cost ($1) under the confirmed fast (same-period) deliveries. No overdue or lost shipments are evident (arrivals concluded each period), so no explicit lead-time adjustment is needed.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history (P1->P20) consistently shows arrived orders same period (lead_time=0), so same-period replenishment is reliable. There is a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 6 that persisted through Period 20 (higher mean & variance). To capture the elevated demand pattern I use recent demand only from the post-changepoint regime. Therefore: L = default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 (covering Periods 6\u201320, regime length=15) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from those last 15 samples. This keeps the base-stock targeted to current high-demand regime, increasing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1 justifies more stock) while sigma_hat from the same window lets the backend size safety stock to reflect recent volatility. This choice also avoids diluting the forecast with older low-demand samples.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every order P1\u2013P21 arrived same period), and demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 6 (sustained high volumes). Profit per unit is $19 and holding cost $1 \u2192 very high service target (q\u22480.95). To ensure service and avoid stockouts given zero pipeline, set lead time using observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N over the large, sustained high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201321 = 16 samples) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 16 samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of last 16 samples. This gives the OR engine an updated base-stock reflecting the new high-demand regime while the high profit vs holding cost drives a high fill-rate target. Because there are no in-transit units and lead time is effectively 0, the order placed this period will arrive same period per observed behavior, helping restore on-hand inventory immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40242.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period). Demand has exhibited a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 6 and continuing through Period 22. Given zero pipeline and zero on-hand, we must order to cover immediate demand. Profit ($19) vs holding ($1) implies a high service-target (q \u2248 0.95) so the OR engine will aim for a high base-stock; to avoid systematic understocking I use a recent-regime estimate for demand. Method choices: L='default' because concluded history confirms lead time = 0 and promised lead time is 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select recent_N with N=17 (Periods 6\u201322) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime length 17). This keeps the forecast and volatility aligned with the current elevated demand rather than diluting with the low early-period samples. This helps the backend produce a larger base_stock to meet high service targets while remaining mindful that holding cost is low relative to profit (favoring service).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 6 extended: avg(P6-22)=1383.71 vs avg(P3-5)=433.67 (+219.2%), sustained over 17 periods (P6\u2013P22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (P1->P1 ... P23->P23). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 6 and persisted through Period 23 (large, sustained increases recorded in carry-over). Because the recent high-demand regime is well-established (Periods 6\u201323, 18 periods), I forecast using the most recent regime rather than the full-sample mean. Choices: L=default to trust promised lead time=0 (concluded data fully supports 0). mu_hat: recent_N with N=18 to set (1+L)*mean over the last 18 demand samples (captures the elevated demand level and avoids dilution from the low early samples). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=18 to capture volatility in the recent high-demand regime. This combination instructs the OR backend to size base stock and the cap around the recently observed higher mean and volatility so orders cover the elevated demand (reducing stockouts) while still accounting for holding cost via the backend's q-based safety stock. Given on-hand=50 and no in-transit, this will typically trigger substantial ordering to refill to the elevated base_stock appropriate for the new regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning at Period 6 that persists through Period 24. Profit = $19, holding = $1 implies a high critical ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95) so the OR backend will target a high service level; to avoid stockouts given the sustained demand increase I bias demand inputs toward the post-shift regime. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period actual lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=19 (use the most recent 19 demand samples since the regime shift at Period 6 through Period 24) \u2014 justified because the demand regime shifted at Period 6 and has been sustained for many periods, so recent-period average best represents current demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=19 to capture current volatility in the same post-shift window. These choices give the OR engine a high base-stock consistent with the current high-demand regime while keeping holding-cost awareness via the backend's critical ratio and cap.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in every concluded period) and a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning at Period 6 that persists through Period 25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand (orders arrive same period under promised lead time). I set L to default to trust the promised lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly in concluded messages). For demand, I focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (Period 6\u201325). Regime length = 20 periods (P6\u2013P25), so I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to have the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most relevant recent data. This directs the backend to target higher base stock reflecting the new demand level while sigma_hat based on the same window captures current volatility. These choices help the OR backend balance service level (by sizing base stock to recent high demand) against holding cost (by using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $46611.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals in the same period (multiple confirms through Period 26), so actual lead time = 0 is well supported. Demand experienced a large, sustained upward regime starting at Period 6 and persisting through the most recent data (Periods 6\u201326). On-hand = 72, in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover the current period's demand plus the review+lead horizon. To capture the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single-period noise, I use recent_N methods based on the long post-changepoint regime. Regime length since Period 6 up through Period 26 is 21 periods; per the rule N = min(regime_length,20) => N=20. Therefore: L = default (promised 0). mu_hat = recent_N with N=20 to base the forecast on the most recent 20 demand observations (reflecting the elevated regime). sigma_hat = recent_N with N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This balances service level (profit much larger than holding cost, so higher target service level) with holding cost by using recent high-demand mean and matching volatility; using 20 most recent periods avoids over-weighting single spikes while honoring the sustained increase since Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47549.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime starting at Period 6 and persisting through Period 27 (many periods with demand >> earlier baseline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (every concluded order from P1\u2013P27 arrived same period). Current inventory: on-hand=103, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no pipeline cover for upcoming high demand. Given the confirmed 0 lead time, we use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) so the OR backend will treat replenishment as same-period. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility, I set demand estimates using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand samples to bias the forecast toward the elevated regime while smoothing short fluctuations). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 captures current volatility so safety stock scales to the observed uncertainty. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts under much higher recent demand) while still letting the backend's cap limit extreme ordering to control holding cost; profit per unit ($19) is high relative to holding ($1), so biasing toward higher base-stock is appropriate.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and repeatedly confirmed by concluded history (orders placed P1\u2013P28 all arrived same period). Recent demand has stepped up sharply since Period_24: demands in P24\u2013P28 = [2504,2479,2457,2508,2890] (avg=2567.6 over last 5 periods). Given zero observed lead time and a clear, sustained higher-demand regime over the last 5 periods, I keep L at the default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples = 1*2567.6). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so the safety stock reflects current variability. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts in the newly higher-demand environment while keeping holding cost awareness via using only the short recent window (balances service level vs holding cost). No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: avg(P24-28)=2567.6 vs prior avg(P6-23)=1383.71 (+85.5%), sustained over 5 periods (P24\u2013P28).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals were same-period) and a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 24 (Periods 24\u201329 demand high, recent avg >> earlier regimes). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must cover current-period demand when ordering (L+1 periods = 1). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the newest regime (Period 24\u201329, regime length=6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 demands) \u2014 this focuses the OR engine on the elevated demand level. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to reflect the volatility observed in the same 6 most recent periods. These choices prioritize meeting very high current demand (reducing lost sales) while giving the OR backend recent-demand inputs to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 24 (Period_24\u2013Period_30), so I anchor forecasts on the most recent regime rather than the full-sample mean. On-hand=4, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no visible pipeline, so we must order to cover upcoming demand. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals across many periods confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period), so I keep L as default (promised). For demand I use a recent_N estimator over the current high-demand regime (Period_24\u2013Period_30, 7 periods) to capture the elevated mean and variability: avg demand over these 7 periods \u2248 2,686 units/period (Period_24\u201330 demands = 2504,2479,2457,2508,2890,2959,3004). With L=0, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = ~2,686 and sigma_hat uses the same 7-period window to capture current volatility. This prioritizes service (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a very high critical ratio ~0.95) while avoiding overstating variability from older, lower-demand periods. The chosen recent_N methods let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the new regime and the cap will limit extreme orders if needed.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Demand has undergone multiple sustained upward regime shifts; most recently a higher-demand regime beginning Period 24 (carry-over shows avg(P24-28)=2567.6 and high demands through Period 31). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand immediately (promised lead time=0 confirmed historically). I set L to default (promised lead time 0) because conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 24\u201331 inclusive cover 8 periods of elevated demand and are the best evidence of current mean and volatility). Using recent_N focuses the backend forecast on the latest sustained demand level so the base-stock will be sized to meet the current high-demand regime while the sigma estimate from the same window sets safety stock to balance the high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). This helps the OR engine avoid chronic stockouts in the current elevated-demand regime while limiting excessive holding costs from older, lower-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59807.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Current on-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201332) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), and carry-over history previously confirmed lead time=0. Demand has a sustained high regime beginning at Period 24 (carry-over: avg(P24-28)=~2567.6 and elevated through P32). I set L to default to use the promised lead time (0), consistent with repeated confirmed arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 (covering Periods 24\u201332) because a clear changepoint at Period 24 produced a sustained, materially higher demand regime; N=9 equals the current length of that regime and satisfies the recent_N rule. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the current high-demand regime so the base-stock covers expected demand over the review+lead period while avoiding being pulled down by older, lower-demand samples. This reduces stockouts in the current regime while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR backend's q-based z*. Given on-hand=62 and no in-transit, this will prompt orders sized to rebuild inventory toward the updated base stock for the new regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (every past order arrived same period). Demand has been at a sustained elevated regime since Period 24; the last 10 periods (P24\u2013P33) average demand \u2248 2,844.8 units/week, significantly above earlier regimes. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover this high recent demand for the review+lead horizon. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0 actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the established high-demand regime (P24\u2013P33, length 10). Using the same recent_N window for sigma_hat ensures the OR backend measures variability from the same regime. These choices produce a base_stock that reflects the new, sustained higher mean while sigma is estimated from the same recent sample to size safety stock appropriately; this balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) and the clear need to avoid stockouts given current zero inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64269.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Context: on-hand = 8, in-transit = 0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P34) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed; lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0 periods, so use the promised/default lead time. Demand has undergone multiple sustained upward regime shifts (notably from Period 6 and again around Period 24) and the most recent regime (roughly Period 24\u219234) shows much higher demand levels (thousands of units). I therefore anchor the demand forecast to the most recent regime rather than the full-sample mean. Chosen methods: L = default to reflect repeatedly confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat = recent_N using the most recent regime window to capture the elevated mean demand and ensure the backend sets a substantially larger base-stock to avoid lost sales; sigma_hat = recent_N with the same recent window so variability reflects the current high-demand regime. I select N=11 (approx. Period 24\u201334) because the regime shift at Period 24 produced a sustained higher-demand period of about 11 periods to date, and N follows the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). This keeps the forecast responsive to the most recent sustained demand level and gives the OR backend a higher \u03bc\u0302 while reflecting current volatility\u2014supporting higher service (profit capture) while the holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19 per unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $66063.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (every concluded order from P1\u2013P35 arrived same period), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. Demand has experienced multiple sustained upward regime shifts, most recently starting at Period 24 (carry-over: P24\u2013P28 avg \u22482568, then higher through P29\u2013P35 with demands ~2.9\u20133.4k). Evidence: concluded history P24\u2013P35 shows large, sustained demands (period-level sold values ~2311\u21923469 arrivals and demands ~2504\u21923624), indicating the recent regime length from P24\u2013P35 is 12 periods. Decision on parameters: L: use "default" because promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=12 to anchor the base-stock to the most recent high-demand regime (N chosen as the recent regime length, between 3 and 20). This will make (1+L)\xd7mean reflect current high demand instead of diluting with much lower early-period data. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current regime volatility. How this balances service vs holding cost: using recent_N for mean and volatility raises the base stock to meet much higher current demand (reducing stockouts and capturing high profit $19/unit), while keeping L at default avoids inflating safety stock for nonexistent lead time (holding cost is only $1/unit). This combination lets the OR backend compute a higher target inventory driven by recent demand evidence without overstating lead-time risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65530.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: confirmed same-day arrivals historically (many concluded messages show lead_time=0). Current on-hand=153, in-transit=0; recent periods (P24\u2013P36) show a sustained, much higher demand regime versus earlier periods, so using long-history averages would under-forecast. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N to target the most recent high-demand regime: I choose N=12 (roughly P25\u2013P36) to capture the sustained elevated demand while smoothing short wiggles; this aligns with the carry-over evidence of a regime starting at P24 and continuing well past P36. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent variability instead of older low-variance data. This setup tells the OR backend to size base-stock around the current high mean and corresponding variability, which raises service level (reducing stockouts) while keeping holding cost awareness (z* computed from profit/(profit+holding) will moderate overstock). Given on-hand=153 and zero pipeline, these parameters will prompt the backend to order up toward a higher base_stock appropriate for recent high demand, preventing frequent stockouts that have occurred in many recent periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201337) consistently show arrivals same-period (orders placed in Pk arrived in Pk), confirming actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in a high regime since the shift at Period 24 (sustained high demand through Period 37). Because on-hand and pipeline are zero and recent demand is much higher than earlier periods, I bias the forecast toward the recent regime to avoid stockouts. Therefore: use default lead time (promised = 0); set mu_hat using recent_N to concentrate on the most recent sustained regime (Period 24 onward) so the backend targets a higher base-stock; set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base stock and safety stock to prioritize service (profit/unit $19 >> holding $1), while the backend cap will limit excessive orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71991.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: Confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time = 0). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 entering Period 39, so we must order to cover immediate demand. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 24; last 15 demand observations (P24\u2013P38) average ~3119.8 units/period. Given profit $19 and holding $1, the OR backend will compute a high service-level (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95) and base-stock from the demand mean and volatility. To align the backend with the current high-demand regime and the confirmed zero lead time, I set L to the promised/default (0). For demand scale and variability I choose recent_N with N=15 (regime length P24\u2013P38 = 15) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 15 periods and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 15 periods. This focuses the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime, avoiding understocking from older low-demand samples while keeping the horizon short because lead time is 0. With on-hand=0 and no in-transit, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to target a high base-stock to meet current elevated demand while the holding cost ($1) moderates extremely large safety stocks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 extended: avg(P24-38)=3119.8 vs prior avg(P6-23)=1383.71 (+125.3%), sustained over 15 periods (P24\u2013P38).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 decision. Context: All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every order from P1\u2013P39 arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 24 (sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover current-period demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period lead time (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=16 (the most recent sustained high-demand regime running from Period 24 through Period 39, length 16). Using the recent 16-sample mean focuses the base-stock on the current elevated demand level and avoids dilution by older lower-demand samples. I apply the same recent_N (N=16) for sigma_hat so the OR engine computes safety stock based on the volatility observed in the current regime. This balances service (high profit per unit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base-stock to current high mean and observed variability while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (every observed order arrived same period). On-hand = 173, in-transit = 0. Demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 24 and has persisted through recent periods (Periods 24\u201340). Given the confirmed 0-period lead time, orders placed this decision will arrive within the same period demand occurs, so we do not need pipeline cover beyond (1+L) periods. To align the OR backend with the current high-demand regime and limit overstock risk, I select L=default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=17, covering Periods 24\u201340 (the sustained high-demand regime) so the base_stock centers on the current regime mean rather than older low-demand data. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=17 so the safety-stock reflects current variability. These choices prioritize service during a prolonged higher-demand regime while keeping carrying costs reasonable given holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_24 (carry-over shows a large, sustained jump beginning P24 and extended through P39). On-hand = 116, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0, so use the default (promised) lead time. To align the OR engine with the most recent high-demand regime, I choose recent_N for demand forecasting using the most recent regime data (Period_24 onwards). Regime length from P24\u2013P41 = 18 periods, so N=18 (captures the latest sustained higher mean/volatility). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat tells the OR backend to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 18 demand samples \u2014 this increases target base stock and safety stock to match elevated demand while avoiding overweighting much older, lower-demand history. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given frequent zero-ending inventory periods) against holding cost by restricting the update window to the confirmed recent regime rather than all historical samples.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 decision. Context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history (P1->P1 through P42->P42). Current inventory: on-hand=82, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the high regime since Period_24 (sustained elevated demand through Period_42). To forecast for the (1+L) review+lead window with the most relevant sample, I use a recent-N estimate anchored on the sustained high-demand regime (Period_24\u2013Period_42). Choosing recent_N with N=19 captures the full recent high-demand regime (19 periods: P24\u2013P42), providing an up-to-date mean for mu_hat and volatility for sigma_hat. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the higher demand while avoiding overreaction to one-off spikes. Using recent data helps the OR backend produce a base_stock that supports a high service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 gives a high target quantile) without inflating holding cost from older, lower-demand periods. Given confirmed L=0 and no in-transit inventory, this approach prioritizes filling the current high demand quickly while keeping safety stock sized by recent volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every concluded period (P1->P1 ... P43->P43). Demand has undergone multiple sustained upshifts; most recently a regime shift at Period 24 producing a high-demand regime that persists through Period 43. To keep service with minimal holding cost, I use the promised/default lead time (0) and base demand forecasts on the most recent stable high-demand regime. I select recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 20 periods (P24\u2013P43) of the current high-demand regime so the OR backend's base-stock and cap calculations reflect the elevated mean and volatility now observed. This emphasizes fill-rate (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overstating demand from older low-demand periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P44 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 24 (carry-over shows large, persistent step-up starting P24 and extended through P38 and beyond). Recent realized demand (P24\u2013P44) is the best indicator for near-term demand. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0, supported by concluded history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent regime (regime length P24\u2013P44 = 21 periods \u2192 cap N at 20 per rules). This focuses the forecast on the elevated demand level and recent volatility so the OR backend's base-stock will target service during the higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost exposure from older low-demand data. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety stock reflects recent variability rather than diluted historical variance. This approach balances service (given high profit vs low holding cost) and holding cost by sizing orders to recent high demand and its volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime over many periods (recent demands much larger than early-period samples). No overdue shipments detected. To be responsive to the current high-demand regime while keeping holding cost modest, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) and use a recent_N demand estimate focusing on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 41\u201345) where demand has stabilized at a higher level. This provides a forecast (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 5) to capture current demand, and sigma_hat uses the recent 5-sample volatility to size safety stock. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat increases service under the elevated regime while avoiding overreaction to older, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88018.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. On-hand=104, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (frequent arrivals same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 6 and increased further around Period 24 (user carry-over shows large, sustained step-ups). With promised lead time = 0 and confirmed 0, use the backend's default lead time handling. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std using the full sample history: this leverages the long, sustained high-demand regime captured in the data while keeping the pipeline calculation consistent with the engine's capping rule. Using defaults keeps our input simple and lets the OR backend apply the profit/holding cost service-level tradeoff (q = profit/(profit+holding) \u2192 higher z* because profit >> holding) to produce orders sized to meet the elevated demand while capping per-period shipments. Given zero in-transit and modest on-hand, default aggregate estimates will prompt the OR engine to replenish toward the new higher base-stock appropriate for the confirmed high-demand regime and 0 lead time, balancing service-level and holding costs.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. All concluded history (P1\u2013P47) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). Demand has been in the high regime for many periods (sustained elevated sales since P24 with especially large volumes P24\u2013P47). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand plus review+lead coverage. I set L to default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm lead_time=0. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (regime length since P24 is >20 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples; this biases the base-stock to service the elevated demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 so the OR engine estimates variability from the same recent high-demand window. These choices prioritize meeting service (high profit per unit $19 vs holding $1) while letting the backend compute the z* service factor and the capped order size; using recent data reduces underordering risk given the clear, sustained upward regime and the confirmed zero lead time.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, all concluded history (P1\u2013P48) shows orders arriving same period (lead_time=0) consistently; recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 24. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend confirm average observed lead time (history strongly indicates 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent stable high-demand regime (Periods 29\u201348 cover the latest 20 samples and reflect current demand scale) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 samples). I use sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. This combination keeps target base stock aligned with the elevated demand regime while avoiding overweighting early low-demand periods; using recent statistics reduces stockouts during this sustained high-demand phase while holding cost is small relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1), so backing higher service level is appropriate given on-hand=0 and no pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50. Demand has been at a sustained, higher regime since Period_24 (large, persistent uplift confirmed in prior carry-over). On-hand = 234, in-transit = 0 so there is no pipeline coverage for upcoming demand; with promised lead time = 0 we still need to plan for same-period demand that will occur after ordering. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period across all concluded periods), so using promised lead time is appropriate. Recent demand regime (Period_24\u2013Period_49) is long and elevated; to keep the OR backend responsive to the most recent high-volume regime while smoothing short-term noise, I select recent_N methods using the most recent 20 samples (regime length since Period_24 is 26 periods so we cap N at 20 per rules). This gives mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean of last 20 demand samples (focuses forecast on the current high-demand regime) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std of last 20 samples (captures recent volatility). These choices help the OR engine set a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts in the prolonged high-demand regime while using a 20-period window to avoid overreacting to single-period spikes. Given current low on-hand and zero in-transit, the backend will likely order up toward the higher base stock to balance the high profit ($19) and modest holding cost ($1).
