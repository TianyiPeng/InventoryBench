Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet, so use promised lead time (default). Historical demand samples available: [103,81,107,127,160] \u2014 no clear sustained regime change (only a rising last sample). To keep the backend conservative but not overreact to a single high sample, use default aggregation so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1. No explicit adjustment for lead-time or volatility since no concluded lead-time evidence or 3+ period shift is present.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Context: on-hand=47, in-transit=0, last concluded period shows Period_1 order arrived=165 with lead_time=0 (ordered P1, arrived P1). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean~115.6 (periods 1-5). Promised lead time is 0 and the only concluded arrival confirms a 0-period lead time for the observed order, so I will use default lead time to let the backend assume the promised lead time. No clear sustained changepoint in demand or lead time (only a single-period lead time observation), so use default statistical estimates: mu_hat default -> (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to capture baseline expected demand (~115.6) for the review+lead window; sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to reflect observed variability. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with historical demand while avoiding overreacting to a single-period signal. With on-hand=47 and no in-transit, the OR engine will decide order quantity to top up toward the computed base stock while respecting caps, balancing the high unit profit ($19) against the modest holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1600.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Demand context: recent data shows a sustained upward regime in Periods 3-5 (samples: 107,127,160) versus earlier periods. Current inventory: on-hand=72, in-transit=0 so no incoming units visible. Observed lead times from concluded history: orders placed in Periods 1-2 arrived same period (lead_time=0). I set L by 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3-5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 3 samples). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. Rationale: with L=0 the OR backend will size base-stock to cover the next (1+L)=1 period; using the recent 3-period mean raises the target to meet the higher demand regime while sigma from recent data keeps safety stock responsive. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given the clear increase) against holding cost by not using the long-run mean which would under-forecast recent lift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 3-5: avg increased from 92.0 (Periods 1-2) to 131.33 (Periods 3-5), +42.7% relative to Periods 1-2.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Context: on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times: Period1-3 all show lead_time=0. Demand recent samples (concluded sales) = [118, 88, 108] (Periods 1-3). There was a previously recorded demand regime shift detected at Period 3 in carry-over history; to be responsive to the most recent regime while avoiding overreacting to older low samples, I use a recent-sample estimate for demand. Choices: L set to "calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (observed = 0 across concluded periods), ensuring the OR engine knows lead time is effectively 0 from observations. mu_hat set to "recent_N" with N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 3 observed demand samples (N=3 is the minimum sensible recent window and equals the available concluded samples), which captures the recent higher-demand regime without diluting with older data. sigma_hat set to "recent_N" with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This combination gives the OR engine a short lead-time, responsiveness to recent demand increases, and a volatility estimate aligned with recent data so orders balance service level (profit-driven high q) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1370.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows arrived lead times = 0 for all concluded orders (orders placed in P1-P4 arrived in the same period). On-hand=55, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low relative to recent demand samples. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (average observed = 0). For mu_hat I used recent_N with N=3 to emphasize the most recent demand regime (Periods 2-4 concluded: 88, 108, 75 \u2192 recent mean \u2248 90.3 units; (1+L)\xd7mean = ~90.3 because L\u22480). This keeps the base-stock focused on the latest demand level rather than older higher samples, avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1 and high profit=$19. sigma_hat is set to 'default' so the backend uses the full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L), giving a conservative safety-stock estimate. Together these choices aim to keep service high (profit much larger than holding cost) while avoiding overstock given current on-hand=55 and zero in-transit; if actual lead time remains 0 the policy will order to replenish to the base-stock computed from recent demand, but if lead times shift the backend\u2019s calculation of L (from 'calculate') will adapt in future periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1766.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: recent data and carry-over show a demand regime shift beginning at Period_3 (Periods 3-5 higher). On-hand=39, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all concluded orders so far had actual lead_time=0. Given the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 3-5), I bias the forecast toward the recent high-demand regime rather than the older low-demand periods. I therefore set L to default (use promised lead time=0) because all observed concluded lead times have been 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 3-5) to capture the new, higher-demand regime; this keeps orders responsive to the elevated mean and avoids diluting the signal with older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility under the new regime. This configuration pushes the OR engine's base-stock upward to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat based on the same recent window limits overstating variability and excess holding. With profit $19 and holding $1, the backend will convert these inputs into an appropriate z* and cap; using recent data reduces stockouts given current on-hand=39 and zero in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent history shows six consecutive same-period arrivals (Periods 1-6 orders all arrived with lead_time=0) so actual lead time is stable at 0. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 at decision time, so we must replenish to cover current period demand (demand occurs after decision). Demand context: earlier carry-over noted a regime shift at Period 3 (higher mean from Periods 3-5). Using the most recent regime (Periods 3-6) for forecasting gives the best representation of current demand. I choose L with 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead times (average observed lead_time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 (the recent regime length: Periods 3-6) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 4 demand samples (108,75,95,122). This balances service level against holding cost by focusing on the most recent demand regime while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0. No overdue shipments or lost orders are evident.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3, P4\u2192P4, P5\u2192P5, P6\u2192P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2527.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 start. Historical demand samples (Periods1-7): [103,81,107,127,160,122,167]. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period through Period 7). Recent demand has been higher since Period 3; I will focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 3-7) to capture the elevated mean and variance. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 3-7) so (1+L)*mean reflects the higher recent mean and avoids dilution by the low Periods 1-2. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to capture elevated volatility in the same recent window. These settings instruct the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet higher near-term demand while keeping holding-cost tradeoff aligned to current profit/holding ratio. No overdue/lost shipments observed; pipeline is zero so orders will immediately cover current period demand given lead time 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3249.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has jumped: Periods 6-8 demands = 122, 167, 214 (avg 167.67), versus Periods 1-5 avg = 96.8. Promised lead time = 0 and previously confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over). Given the sustained 3-period demand increase (a clear changepoint at Period 6), I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 periods). For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 so the OR engine inflates safety stock appropriately for the higher variability seen in the last 3 periods. This raises the base-stock to prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while the sigma choice tempers over-ordering by capturing observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 6-8: avg increased from 96.8 (Periods 1-5) to 167.67 (Periods 6-8), +73.2% sustained over 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3736.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P9 arrived same period). Demand has a clear upward regime starting Period 6 (P6\u2013P9 demands = 121,167,214,199; avg = 175.25) vs earlier periods (P1\u2013P5 avg = 96.8). This increase is sustained for 4 periods, so I forecast using the most recent regime. Decisions: (1) L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because conclude history consistently confirms 0 lead time. (2) mu_hat: use recent_N with N=4 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 4 demand observations (Periods 6\u20139), capturing the new higher demand level. (3) sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility in the current regime. Using recent_N for mean and std lets the OR backend set a base-stock that responds to the sustained demand increase while default L keeps the pipeline horizon minimal. This balances higher service (avoiding stockouts in a higher-demand regime) against holding cost since on-hand is already moderate (45) and holding cost is low relative to profit (H=$1 vs profit=$19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2257.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11. Context: on-hand=118, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period through Period 10), so promised lead time = 0 is still supported. Demand has shifted up since early periods: a sustained higher regime began around Period 6. Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 122,167,214,199,125) remains well above early-period averages, but shows variability. I choose L="default" to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. For demand level I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 6-10) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 samples) which captures the recent higher regime while smoothing the P10 dip. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices give the OR backend a forecast centered on the elevated recent demand and a sigma reflecting recent variance; with profit >> holding cost (q\u22480.95) the backend will target a high service level but using recent_N prevents overreacting to a single high or low period. No in-transit units currently, so orders will need to cover immediate demand given L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3545.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 context: on-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so promised lead time = 0 is reliable. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 6: recent demands (P7\u2013P11) = [167,214,199,125,189], 5-period mean = 178.8 units. With profit = $19 and holding = $1, the critical ratio is high, so we favor higher service level to avoid lost profit from stockouts. I choose L = default to use the promised 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher regime since Period 6 while smoothing one lower outlier (P10=125). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) captures recent volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand periods. This set increases the base-stock to reflect the new higher-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost (high profit per unit justifies higher safety stock). Also reconciled inventory: with (1+L)=1, mu_hat will be set to the 5-period mean (178.8) so current on-hand=46 is well below the target; OR backend will order to raise pipeline toward that base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Periods 6-11: avg increased from 96.8 (Periods 1-5) to 169.3 (Periods 6-11), +75.1% (sustained over 6 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 context: recent history confirms a sustained higher-demand regime. Last 6 demand samples (Periods 6-11) = [122, 167, 214, 199, 125, 189], mean = 169.33 units/period (matches prior carry-over insight). On-hand=23, in-transit=0 so pipeline inventory=23 \u2014 well below expected single-period demand. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead times in concluded messages are all 0, so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm this. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent confirmed high-demand regime (regime length = 6 periods, so N=6) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples (with L\u22480 this targets \u2248169.3). Volatility can change in the new regime so I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of those 6 samples). These choices prioritize service (profit $19 >> holding $1) by forecasting to the higher sustained demand regime and using recent regime statistics to avoid under-ordering. At the same time the OR engine's cap will prevent wildly large single orders, and using recent_N for sigma limits excess safety stock caused by older low-demand variance. No overdue shipments are visible (arrivals have been punctual), so no explicit lead-time stretch or lost-order adjustment is applied.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision with on-hand=26 and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P13) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (evidence: Periods 6\u201311 avg demand increased ~75% vs Periods 1\u20135 and recent periods P6\u201313 remain elevated). Given confirmed L=0, I use recent demand to forecast the current (review+lead) period demand. Method choices: L=default to rely on the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 6\u201311 is a clear changepoint and length 6 meets the recent_N rules), which raises the base stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts during this elevated demand while keeping holding costs in check. This balances the high per-unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by biasing toward service (higher \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 from recent high-demand samples) to maximize profit \xd7 units_sold net of holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3790.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 context: on-hand=48, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P14) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 6 (Periods 6\u201314 show elevated demand vs Periods 1\u20135). Recent realized demands (Periods 6\u201314) are considerably above early-period mean, so I anchor forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime. I choose L = default to keep promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0), mu_hat = recent_N with N=9 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 9 periods (Periods 6\u201314) capturing the sustained elevated demand, and sigma_hat = recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet higher service requirements while sigma from recent data avoids underestimating variability; using recent_N reduces risk of stockouts given zero lead time and current low pipeline. No new carry-over insight to record.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2916.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: on-hand=86, in-transit=0, lead time promised=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P1 through P15\u2192arrived P15), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained elevated demand through Periods 6\u201315). To capture the current elevated demand level I use recent data covering the most recent sustained regime. I set L to the default/promised lead time (0) because concluded history shows lead time=0 consistently. For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime: the recent high-demand regime spans roughly Periods 6\u201315 (regime length \u224810), so I choose N=10 to reflect that sustained increase while providing stable estimates. For sigma_hat I likewise use recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility in the high-demand regime. These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base-stock to satisfy the elevated demand while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability; using recent_N avoids dilution from the much lower early-period demands and leverages confirmed lead-time=0 so orders can arrive same period.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: on-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 for all concluded orders through Period 16) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6. Recent demands (Periods 6-16) are much larger than Periods 1-5, so I focus forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. L: use promised lead time (default=0) because observed lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 6-16, regime length = 11). This makes the (1+L)-period demand forecast reflect the elevated recent average rather than dilute it with low early-period demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=11 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime, so safety stock scales appropriately. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while keeping holding costs in check by using recent demand statistics rather than the full-history mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3662.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: on-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P17) show a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 6 (previously recorded). Recent demands (P6\u2013P17) remain elevated relative to P1\u2013P5, so I treat the high-demand regime as continuing. Promised lead time = 0 has been consistently observed in concluded history (orders arriving same period through P17), so I keep L as default. To align the OR backend with the sustained higher-demand regime and to avoid stockouts (high profit $19 vs holding $1 favors service), I set demand estimates using recent data: use the last 12 demand samples (Periods 6\u201317) to capture the current regime mean/volatility. This gives the OR engine a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat reflecting current demand so base-stock and cap calculations increase ordering to meet elevated demand while still respecting the capped order. Carry-over: no new sustained changepoint since the last recorded insight (Period 12), so none added.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) across many periods and a sustained higher-demand regime since about Period 6. Recent realized demands (Periods 6-18) are substantially above early-period averages, so forecasts should rely on the recent high-demand regime. There are no overdue or in-transit shipments to reconcile. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 and there is no evidence of lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime: choose N=13 to cover Periods 6\u201318 (the most recent sustained high-demand window) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 13 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase the base stock to meet much higher recent demands (reducing stockouts and lost profit) while the low holding cost ($1) makes carrying extra inventory acceptable relative to the $19 profit per unit.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6; the most recent 14 concluded demand observations (Periods 6\u201319) average \u2248190 units/period, substantially above the early-period mean. Profit/holding implies a very high service target (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95) so the OR engine will inflate base stock via z*. To avoid stockouts given the sustained high-demand regime and zero lead time, I set L=default to keep the model aligned with promised lead time, and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the elevated mean and current volatility (using the last 14 demands, Periods 6\u201319). This ensures the backend computes (1+L)*mean reflecting the current demand regime and a matching std for safety stock, balancing service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given the profit/holding ratio.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime since Period 6 (carry-over insights already recorded). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 \u2014 we must replenish to meet current high demand and avoid lost sales. To capture the elevated demand level and its recent variability, I use recent_N methods over the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201320, 15 samples). This sets mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7mean of last 15 observations so the OR engine plans against the elevated mean; sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the same 15 samples to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance higher service level (via larger base stock) against holding cost by grounding forecasts in the sustained high-demand regime rather than older lower-demand data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods for many periods; demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained high demand through Period 21). Current pipeline is empty so we must replenish to cover current-period demand plus lead-time (L+1 periods = 1 period). I select L='default' to trust the promised 0-period lead time which is well supported by concluded arrivals. For demand parameters I choose recent_N with N=16 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime from Periods 6\u201321 (regime length 16). Using recent_N for mu_hat gives the OR engine a forecaster focused on the latest high-demand regime so base_stock will target service given the higher mean; using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N captures volatility in the same recent window. This combination prioritizes meeting current elevated demand (reducing stockouts and lost profit) while the holding cost is low relative to profit, so biasing toward higher service is appropriate. Because on-hand+in-transit=0, these settings will prompt the OR backend to order up toward the base-stock appropriate for the elevated recent demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: all concluded history (Periods 1\u201322) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover imminent demand. Recent demand has been substantially higher than early periods: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18\u201322) = [250, 215, 324, 283, 322], average \u2248 278.8 units. I therefore set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime evident since Period 6 and especially the last several periods; backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 so the safety-stock calculation reflects recent volatility. This choice balances service level (high demand recently) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than diluting with older, lower-demand samples. Because on-hand and pipeline are zero, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to replenish to a base stock appropriate for the elevated recent demand while capping orders per its cap rule.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2192P23) consistently show arrived same period as ordered; actual lead time repeatedly observed as 0 \u2014 so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (carry-over shows sustained higher mean ~169 over P6\u2013P11 and later periods with strong sales through P23). To target high service given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I rely on a recent-regime demand estimate rather than the long-ago low-demand samples. Therefore: set L=default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (use N=18 covering Period 6\u201323) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 18 samples; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 so variability is estimated from the same recent window. This increases target base-stock to match elevated demand while keeping variability estimate aligned to recent behavior, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has clearly moved to a higher regime since Periods 6-11 and recent periods (P20-P24) show sustained high demand (P20-24 demands = 324,283,322,329,286; 5-period mean \u2248 308.8). To balance service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) I prioritize meeting expected near-term demand by sizing mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current elevated mean and volatility while keeping L at the promised/default. This gives the OR backend a forecast focused on the current high-demand regime and higher short-term variability so base-stock will increase to avoid costly stockouts while holding cost remains modest.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6154.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6 through Period 25 (long run of elevated demands vs. Periods 1-5). On-hand = 21, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low relative to recent period demand (typical single-period demand recently ~250\u2013330). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0; no evidence of lost shipments. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201325, length = 20). This gives the OR engine (which multiplies by (1+L)) a forecast anchored to the elevated mean and volatility, improving service level and avoiding frequent stockouts while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19). L: default (use promised 0). mu_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to measure current volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting elevated demand while letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, prior history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across concluded periods) and a sustained higher-demand regime that began around Period 6 and has continued through Period 26. I expect demand to remain in this elevated regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained, higher-demand regime (use the most recent 20 demand observations to form (1+L)\xd7mean). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect the recent volatility rather than diluting with much older, lower-demand samples. These choices increase the base-stock to reduce stockouts under the new higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock. With profit >> holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), the OR backend will favor higher service levels; my recent-based mu_hat and sigma_hat anchor that to recent demand evidence.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so promised lead time remains reliable. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since around Period 6 (already recorded in carry-over). To capture the sustained elevated demand while giving weight to more recent data, I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 13\u201327, length=15). Therefore: L uses default (promised lead time = 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=15 to set (1+L)*mean of the last 15 demand samples so the backend targets a base-stock that matches the elevated demand level and reduces stockouts. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=15 to reflect recent volatility; this keeps the safety stock responsive to current variability. This combination balances service (avoid lost sales with higher mu_hat) against holding cost (sigma_hat based on recent variability prevents overstocking).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has accelerated sharply over the last five periods (Periods 24-28). Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time = 0 confirmed repeatedly, so I will use the default lead time. Demand evidence: Periods 24-28 demands = [286, 325, 351, 379, 394] (avg \u2248 347 over 5 periods) which is a sustained, large increase vs the previously recorded higher-demand regime (Periods 6-23 avg \u2248 169). Given this recent, sustained elevation and the immediate stockout risk (on-hand=0), I choose to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 periods to make the OR backend target a higher base stock and capture increased variability. Using recent_N for mu_hat increases the (1+L)-period forecast to match the new regime; recent_N for sigma_hat raises safety stock to maintain service while trading off holding cost. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 24-28: avg increased to 347.0 (Periods 24-28) from prior regime avg 169.3 (Periods 6-23), +105.1% sustained over 5 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period through Period 29). Demand has clearly moved to a higher regime starting around Period 24; recent demands (Periods 24-29) = [286, 325, 351, 379, 394, 402], average \u2248 356 units. With promised L=0 and no in-transit stock, we must plan for current high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost shipments. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (regime length \u2248 6 periods from Periods 24\u201329); this yields (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 samples \u2248 356. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=6 so the OR engine uses recent volatility reflecting the new regime. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher sustained demand while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with confirmed arrivals to avoid over-ordering. With on-hand=17 and in-transit=0, the backend will compute orders to bring pipeline up to the new regime-based base stock, balancing high profit ($19) against modest holding cost ($1) through the prescribed service-level calculation.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in many periods), so promised lead time appears reliable. Demand has clearly moved into a higher regime since Periods 24-30 (recent demands ~286\u2013457, many periods near or above 300). To keep service high (profit $19 >> holding $1) while avoiding stockouts given zero visible pipeline, I use the default lead time (trust promised L=0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach with N=7 (Periods 24-30) to capture the current high-demand regime length (7 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 7 samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 7 samples). These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand (reducing lost sales which are costly given high profit) while letting the OR backend compute the z-safety stock tradeoff against holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 decision. Recent demand remains in a high regime: last three concluded demands (Periods 29-31) = 402, 457, 402 (avg \u2248 420 units). On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0, so pipeline does not cover upcoming demand; no arrivals are visible for this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. To be responsive to the recent upward demand (3-period sustained uptick) I use a short recent_N window (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine increases target stock to match the new demand level while keeping variability estimates focused on the most recent regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given very high recent demand) against holding cost by not overreacting to older, lower-demand periods. No new long-term regime or lead-time changes meet the conservative threshold for a carry-over insight.

Historical demand samples (Periods 1-32) show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 and especially post-Period 24; concluded arrivals for every historical order indicate actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods. Because concluded lead-time observations are uniformly 0, I select L using the averaged observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. With lead time effectively 0 and profit $19 vs holding $1 (q \u2248 0.95), the backend should target a high service level. I therefore leave demand and volatility estimation to the backend defaults so it computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) using the full sample history; this leverages the full regime history (including the recent sustained high-demand periods) while keeping calculations simple and stable. This choice balances the need for high availability (high profit motivates high fill rate) against holding costs by letting the OR engine compute the z* and cap using the confirmed L and full-sample statistics.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: recent demand has been at a sustained higher regime since Period 24 (carry-over notes). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we are fully exposed to stockouts this period. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period), so use the default promised lead time. Demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 24-33) is clearly elevated vs earlier regimes (periods 24-33 avg \u2248 347\u2013457 range), so I anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent regime to capture the higher mean and increased volatility. I choose recent_N with N=10 (regime length = 10 periods) so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 10 samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of last 10 samples; this raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs in check given profit >> holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9315.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent history shows a sustained, higher demand regime over the last 5 periods (Periods 30-34) with very large weekly sales (avg ~475 units). All concluded lead-time observations are 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so promised lead time remains consistent with observations. Current inventory: on-hand=33, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no buffer vs. the recent demand level, so we must target a high service level to avoid stockouts. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 so the backend will choose a high z (\u2248\u03a6\u22121(0.95)). To reflect the confirmed recent upward shift and to keep pipeline appropriate for the (1+L) review+lead horizon, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility based on the most recent regime (Periods 30-34). I select N=5 (regime length = 5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L uses the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0 lead time. This combination instructs the OR engine to size base-stock around the recent elevated mean (capturing the ~475 avg) and use recent volatility to compute safety stock, which balances the high service-level target implied by profit vs holding cost while avoiding unnecessary inventory buildup from older, lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30-34: avg increased to 475.2 from prior regime avg 347.0 (Periods 24-28), +37.0% sustained over 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10507.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent history shows sustained high demand regime established around Periods 30-35 (Periods 30-34 avg=475.2; Period 35 demand=591) and lead time has been consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period through Period 35). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand as orders arrive same period. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded messages confirm actual lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasts to the most recent high-demand regime (regime length=5 periods, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5). This biases the backend toward higher base stock and higher safety stock reflecting the new demand level while avoiding dilution by older, lower-demand history. Using recent_N for sigma_hat increases the volatility estimate to reflect recent variability, which together with higher mu_hat increases orders to reduce stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1), so prioritizing service is appropriate.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 start: on-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders placed in P1\u2013P36 all arrived same period). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime in recent periods (notably increases documented in carry-over: big jumps around Periods 24\u201335). To capture the current high demand regime I use a recent-N forecast: I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (using the last 6 observed demand periods to reflect the most recent high-demand regime and its volatility). This keeps the base-stock tuned to the current elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to single-period noise. No overdue or missing shipments to adjust for, so the parameters focus on matching service level to profit (high profit -> higher service quantile) while limiting holding cost by using a recent-regime estimate rather than the long-run average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10905.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods across all concluded periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P1 ... P37\u2192arrived P37). On-hand = 39, in-transit = 0 so there are no pending arrivals to cover upcoming demand. Recent demand shows we are in the high-demand regime established since Periods ~30-35: most recent five demands (P33\u2013P37) = [518, 492, 591, 549, 576], mean = 545.2 and sample std \u2248 40.7. To keep service during this sustained high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I set lead time to the promised/default (0) because concluded messages confirm L=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 5 periods = 545.2 units review+lead demand). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 so the OR engine sets safety stock based on the observed short-term variability (std \u2248 40.7; backend will scale by sqrt(1+L)). These settings prioritize meeting very high near-term demand while avoiding overstating demand from older, lower-demand periods. Given on-hand=39 and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order up to the computed base-stock to reduce stockouts in the immediate periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 summary: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Periods 1\u201338 arrived the same period (lead_time observed = 0 repeatedly), so promised lead time 0 is confirmed. Demand has been in a higher regime since around Period 24 with especially large recent demands (Periods 30\u201338 frequently 400\u2013600+), so we must keep replenishment aggressive to avoid lost sales. Given the clear and sustained confirmation of actual lead time = 0 and abundant historical demand data, I choose: L='default' to use the promised (and empirically confirmed) 0-period lead time; mu_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) capturing the full-sample average across the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) reflecting observed variability. This combination leverages the backend's base-stock calculation while respecting the confirmed zero lead time and the elevated demand regime, balancing service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201339) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders ordered in Pk arrived in Pk for many periods), so promised lead time = 0 is reliable. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201339 show substantially higher demand than earlier regimes). To capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, I use recent_N methods based on the last 10 demand periods (Periods 30\u201339). Setting L to default (promised lead time 0) keeps the OR engine aligned with observed arrivals. Using mu_hat recent_N (N=10) gives the backend an (1+L)\xd7mean that reflects the recent elevated demand, improving service without overcommitting to older, lower-demand data. Using sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) captures the recent volatility so the backend's safety stock component scales appropriately. This combination balances high profit per unit (Profit=$19) against low holding cost ($1) by prioritizing service under the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime (Periods 36-40 demands = 549, 576, 614, 648, 649). On-hand = 10, in-transit = 0 so we are low relative to recent demand. Historical concluded messages consistently show orders arriving same-period (lead_time = 0 confirmed), so use promised/default lead time. To capture the elevated demand regime I set mu_hat using a recent_N window of the last 5 periods (1+L times mean of P36-40) so the OR engine targets a base stock aligned with the current high-demand level and reduces stockouts. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices trade higher service (fewer lost sales at profit $19) against modest holding cost $1 by basing forecasts on the most recent regime evidence.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period through Period 41), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shown a sustained high regime since around Period 36: Periods 36-41 demands = [549,576,614,648,649,755] (6 periods) \u2014 this is materially higher than earlier regimes. To capture the current elevated mean and recent volatility, I use a recent_N forecast based on the last 6 periods (Periods 36-41). This sets mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 samples and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 6 samples, which biases the base-stock toward meeting the current high demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability. Using recent data helps avoid under-ordering given the large upward shift; keeping L as default (0) aligns with observed lead-time behavior and prevents inflating the (1+L) multiplier or safety buffer unnecessarily.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=10, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods with orders arriving same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period ~24 with most recent periods (Periods 38\u201342) showing elevated demand (614, 648, 649, 755, 741). Because demand regime is clearly higher and recent variation is relevant for safety stock, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand observations to capture the current regime. I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded history confirms lead time = 0. Using recent_N (N=5) centers the base-stock on the immediate high-demand level so the OR backend will order to meet the current elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility\u2014this balances lost-sales risk (high profit $19) against low holding cost $1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time has been 0 consistently through Period 43. Demand has clearly been elevated since Period 36 (sustained high sales through Period 43). With virtually no pipeline and only 11 on-hand, we must set demand estimates using the most recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time = 0, supported by concluded history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (the most recent sustained regime, Periods 36-43): this focuses the (1+L)-period forecast on observed high sales instead of diluting with older, lower-demand samples. Using recent_N for mu_hat raises base stock to meet the higher realized demand; using recent_N for sigma_hat captures the recent volatility so the OR backend sets safety stock appropriately. This approach balances service (avoid costly lost sales given high profit $19/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit) by targeting current demand regime and confirmed lead-time=0. Also flag: on-hand+pipeline (11) is far below one period of recent demand (~640 avg), so the backend will order up to the computed base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 36-43: avg demand increased to 639.8 (Periods 36-43) from prior regime avg 475.2 (Periods 30-34), +34.6% sustained over 8 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages through Period 44 show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P1 ... P44\u2192P44). Demand has been in a high regime since Periods 36-44 (carry-over records show avg \u2248639.8 for P36-43 and P44 demand=845). With on-hand=0 and no pipeline, we must replenish to cover this high recent demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded history strongly confirms 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 36-44, regime_length=9) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 9 samples. Using recent_N focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand regime, increasing service level and profit while keeping holding costs controlled by using recent volatility rather than long-run lower-demand variability. This also avoids under-ordering given zero observed lead time and zero pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 for many periods (sustained evidence through Period 45). Demand has been in a high regime for many periods; most recent 5 concluded period demands (P41\u2013P45) = 755, 741, 774, 845, 919 (avg \u2248 806.8). With no pipeline inventory and high recent demand, I choose to anchor the forecast to the most recent regime to avoid stockouts. Therefore: L set to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history strongly confirms 0 lead time. mu_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices push the OR backend to a base-stock sized for the current high-demand regime (raising service level to avoid lost sales) while using a recent volatility estimate so safety stock balances holding cost vs. stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17670.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 decision. On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period across history), so promised lead time remains accurate. Demand has moved through multiple upward regime shifts; most recent periods (P37\u2013P46) show substantially higher demand (many periods of 500\u2013930 units, with P44\u2013P46 = 845, 919, 930). With no pipeline and high recent demand, I favor a forecast based on the most recent observations to avoid understock and lost sales. 

Choices: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (last ten demand samples) to capture the current elevated demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This ensures the backend computes base_stock that reflects the heightened demand (covering the (1+L) review+lead period) and uses a volatility estimate from the same recent window. Given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1 (service quantile q\u22480.95), the OR backend will target a high service level; using recent data prevents systematic underordering in this sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost exposure reasonable because lead time is 0 and we only need to cover one period ahead. 

On-hand + pipeline = 0, so the OR engine will aim to order up to the computed base-stock. If the recent high-demand pattern persists, this parameterization reduces stockouts; if demand falls quickly, holding cost is modest ($1/unit/period) relative to profit, and the high service quantile is appropriate.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period through Period 47). Demand has been in a high regime for many periods (notable increases documented in carry-over). To keep service high given zero visible pipeline and strong recent demand, I use the promised lead time (default) and base the demand forecast on recent data. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=12 (Periods 36\u201347) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This yields (1+L)-scaled recent mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)-scaled recent std for sigma_hat. Using recent data increases order quantities to reduce stockouts given zero on-hand/in-transit; it also informs the OR backend's safety-stock via sigma_hat so the base-stock balances profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $18810.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Recent demand has jumped sharply: Periods 44-48 demands = [845, 919, 930, 986, 1036], average ~943.2 \u2014 a sustained high-demand regime over 5 periods. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no pipeline to cover current demand; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 0 for every past order, so using the promised/default lead time is supported. To capture the recent, sustained upward demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=5) so the OR engine targets inventory appropriate to the new higher demand while sigma is estimated from the same window for realistic safety stock. Using recent_N (N=5) increases service level in this high-demand regime without over-weighting older, lower-demand periods. L uses default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 44-48: avg increased to 943.2 (Periods 44-48) from prior regime avg 639.8 (Periods 36-43), +47.4% sustained over 5 periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P1 ... P49\u2192P49). Recent demand has moved into a higher regime: Periods 45-49 demands = [919, 930, 986, 1036, 1104], recent mean = 995 units. Given confirmed same-period lead time and strong, sustained upward demand (recent 5 periods), I set L to the promised/default (0). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean (captures the recent high-demand regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than historical low-regime variance. These choices steer the OR backend toward a high base-stock (matching current demand) while still using the capped-order logic to limit order size relative to expected demand and mitigate holding cost exposure.
