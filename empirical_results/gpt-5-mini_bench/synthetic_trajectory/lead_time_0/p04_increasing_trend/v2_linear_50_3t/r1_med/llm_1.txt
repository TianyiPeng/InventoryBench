Because arrivals happen after the decision phase, an order placed now might not arrive before this period's demand if actual lead time \u22651. We therefore must at minimum cover the likely current-period demand with on-order units. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. There are no confirmed arrivals or lead-time evidence to rely on. Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit sold implies leftover stock is not extremely expensive relative to profit, so it is reasonable to carry a small safety buffer. e) Final order logic: Forecast current-period demand \u224850. To avoid stockout this period given on-hand=0 and uncertain actual lead time, place an order to cover ~1 period of demand (50 units). This balances service (avoid lost sales at $4 profit/unit) against holding cost risk. Monitor 'Period 1 conclude' next period to determine actual arrival (lead time) and adjust future orders. ",

This is a clear recent spike in realized demand at P3. The three-period sample shows mean demand = (50+45+86)/3 = 60.3, with the last period much higher (86). c) Lead time and missing orders: Concluded arrival records show orders placed in P1,P2,P3 all arrived in the same period (arrived units noted as ordered on same period, lead_time 0). This is consistent for three consecutive periods, so actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). No evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0.

The cost of stocking extra is small relative to missed profit from stockouts. Given the recent high demand (86 in P3) and an average ~60, I choose to aim to fully satisfy likely demand and avoid lost sales.
