This confirms actual lead time = 0 for the observed period. (Remember: this conclusion is allowed because the conclude message explicitly states the lead time.)\n2) Demand & historical stats: Historical samples for chips(Regular) are [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] with empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 49.6 and sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 12.90. OR uses promised L; we have confirmed actual L = 0, so \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)\xd7\u03bc\u0304 = 1\xd749.6 = 49.6 and \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a(1+L)\xd7\u03c3\u0304 = 12.90.\n3) OR baseline check: OR recommended 50 units. Using the OR formula with profit=holding cost gives critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 = 49.6 \u2248 50. Order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory = 49.6 \u2212 0 = 49.6.\n4) Cap check: cap = \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + \u03a6\u22121(0.95)\xd7\u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L) = 49.6 + 1.645\xd712.90 \u2248 70.8, which does not bind.

Realized concluded demands: Period 1 demand 50 (sold 50) and Period 2 demand 91 (sold 50, shortage occurred). Two periods of high realized demand (especially P2=91) suggest possible short-term spike but do not yet meet the threshold for a sustained regime change (carry-over requires \u22653 periods of consistent evidence).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk trade-offs and decision logic: Profit and holding cost are equal, so the classical newsvendor critical fractile is 0.5 \u2014 we should be indifferent between small overage and underage. However, given (a) confirmed lead time 0 so any ordered units will immediately mitigate stockouts, (b) recent realized demand included a very large spike (P2=91) causing lost sales when inventory was 0, and (c) OR already increased its uncapped recommendation to 56 likely to protect against variability, I will follow the OR recommendation. Ordering 56 balances the measured average demand (~50) with a modest buffer to reduce the chance of another large stockout, without incurring excessive holding cost.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action: Order 56 units for chips(Regular).

The OR baseline uses historical samples and the promised lead time; with profit = holding = $1 the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* = 0) so OR essentially targets the empirical mean over the replenishment horizon.

Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all demand must be met from a new order. OR recommends 57 units; OR uses historical samples and the promised lead time (0) with a base-stock/cap rule. However, actual realized demands in recent periods have been well above OR's historical mean: actual demands recorded in concluded periods = [50, 91, 60, 50, 70] with a 5-period average \u2248 64.2 and a recent 3-period average (Periods 3\u20135) = (60+50+70)/3 = 60. The previously noted carry-over insight flagged a sustained upward regime (\u2248+35% vs older sample mean). Cost trade-off: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1, so over-ordering directly reduces period reward at the same rate as under-ordering reduces sold units; the objective favors tightly matching expected demand rather than building excess inventory.

Given consistent higher realized demand in recent periods (periods 5\u20136 sold 63 and 64 respectively when supplied), I expect single-period demand around mid-60s. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding), so overstocking carries the same per-unit penalty as the per-unit sales benefit; therefore the economically optimal action is to order to meet expected demand rather than bias toward extra safety stock.

With lead_time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 9 and can be used to satisfy Period 9 demand. There are no in-transit units to consider. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory posture: On-hand = 6, in-transit = 0. Because L=0, we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 = 1) with order + on-hand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand estimate & OR baseline: OR recommends 57 units (it relies on historical average and promised lead time). However recent realized demand has increased: last three realized demands (Periods 6\u20138) = 70, 106, 65 \u2192 3-period average = 80.33 units. This 3-period average is sustained (3 periods) and higher than OR's implicit single-period forecast, so OR's 57 underestimates current demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Policy decision: Given profit = holding cost ($1 vs $1), the standard critical fractile would be 0.5 (no added safety stock). Therefore target single-period stocking should be roughly the expected next-period demand. Using the recent 3-period average as the best short-term forecast (80.33 \u2248 80), target on-hand after arrival \u2248 80 units. With current on-hand 6 and immediate arrival (L=0), order = target - on-hand = 80 - 6 = 74 units. Rounding to integer and preventing negative order yields order = 74.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk & trade-offs: This raises OR's 57 \u2192 74 to reduce expected stockouts given the sustained uplift in recent demand. Because holding cost equals profit, excess inventory is as costly as missed profit, so I do not add extra safety stock beyond the short-term demand estimate. If upcoming periods show demand falling, future orders will be cut back quickly due to L=0.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Execution summary: Place order of 74 units so that arrivals during Period 9 plus the 6 on-hand cover an expected demand of ~80 units this period.

This is well above the OR baseline recommendation (65) and above the earlier historical averages; the sequence of three high periods supports a sustained higher-demand regime in recent periods.  \n4) OR recommendation vs. our decision: OR recommends 65 units (it uses older historical mean and the promised lead time). Given confirmed lead time = 0 and an observed three-period average demand \u224886.3, I raise the order to match expected single-period demand. Because profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1, there is no economic advantage to carrying extra safety stock (each unsold unit would incur holding cost equal to its profit); therefore ordering approximately the expected demand (no extra safety stock) maximizes expected period profit.  \n5) Final action: Order 86 units to cover expected Period 10 demand (arrives same period). This balances the higher recent demand signal against the symmetric profit/holding cost which discourages overstocking.  \n6) Risk notes: If demand reverts downward, excess inventory will incur a full-period holding cost equal to profit, reducing net reward; conversely, under-ordering would forgo $1 profit per unmet unit.

Recent realized demands (Periods 8\u201310) = {65, 88, 47} \u2192 recent 3-period average \u2248 66.7 units; earlier recent window (P5\u2013P7) also showed elevated demand, and carry-over insights already flagged a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 5. With profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 so safety stock from OR is zero (z*=0) and base-stock is essentially the mean demand. OR recommended 24 units (it uses older historical samples and promised lead time). Because actual demand has shifted upward (recent mean ~66.7) and we currently hold only 39 units, ordering only OR's 24 would leave expected available = 63, below recent mean; that risks avoidable stockouts. With lead time = 0, we can safely top up to cover expected single-period demand without pipeline delay. Recommendation decision: target the recent 3-period average demand \u224866.7. To avoid overreacting to the 88 spike while covering typical elevated demand, order = max(0, round(target_mean \u2212 on_hand)) = round(66.7 \u2212 39) \u2248 28 units.

Recent demands (Periods 9\u201311) = [88, 47, 66] \u2192 mean = 67.3. Expanding slightly to P8\u2013P11 = [65, 88, 47, 66] \u2192 mean = 66.5.

Variability is high, but we have only immediate replenishment (L=0), so we primarily target next-period expected demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 63 units (based on promised L and historical samples). That is slightly below the recent single-period mean (~66\u201367).

OR recommendation: OR suggests 75 units, which is based on the original historical samples and its capped base-stock; OR does not incorporate the confirmed lead-time=0 nor the recent sustained higher demand. Decision logic: Because lead time is 0, we should order enough to cover one period's expected demand (L+1 = 1).

Therefore an order placed now arrives in Period 19 before demand is realized in that same period (consistent with confirmed lead_time=0). Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must supply all of Period 19's expected demand with this order. Demand assessment: recent realized demands are high and elevated vs original historical samples. Last periods' demands: P15=94, P16=88, P17=113, P18=116. The most recent 3-period average (P16\u2013P18) = (88+113+116)/3 = 105.7; 4-period avg (P15\u2013P18) = 102.75. OR recommendation: 77 units (uses original historical stats and promised lead time). Service-level math: profit = holding cost, so critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 target is the mean demand over the (L+1)=1 period. That implies ordering to the expected single-period demand (no extra safety stock implied by q=0.5). Decision & adjustment: OR's 77 is well below the recent realized mean (~103\u2013106) and would very likely cause a stockout. Because lead time is 0, we can order to match our expected single-period demand without tying up pipeline. I choose to order 100 units \u2014 slightly below the recent 3-period mean (105.7) to temper holding cost (holding penalty equals profit) while still materially higher than OR's 77 to avoid expected stockouts. This balances the equal cost of lost profit vs holding: ordering 100 gives good chance to meet demand while limiting excess ending inventory.

Earlier carry-over insights already recorded the regime shift that started at Period 12 (avg \u2248110.3), so this elevated demand level is persistent.

Policy decision: with profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*\u22480) so no extra safety stock beyond expected demand is indicated. Since lead time = 0, we should order approximately the expected single-period demand for Period 20.

Step 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Historical sample (given) had lower mean (~49.6) but the operational history shows a clear, sustained increase in demand since Period 12 (carry-over insight).

Therefore actual lead time = 0 (orders placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and will be available for demand in Period 23). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has trended up and is currently running ~120\u2013125 units per period (Periods 18\u201322 average \u2248124.2 units; Periods 17\u201321 avg \u2248123.4 shown in carry-over). The last observed demand (P22) was 117, and several preceding periods were >110 with one spike to 155, so current demand expectation \u2248124 units. OR recommendation = 76 units, which uses older historical assumptions and the promised lead time; it is substantially below the observed recent demand and would cause a large stockout. Decision logic: With lead time = 0 we can match order to expected single-period demand and minimize both stockouts and unnecessary end-of-period holding. Because profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), there is no benefit to systematic over-ordering beyond expected demand (extra units held cost as much as they earn when sold later). Final action: order enough to bring available inventory up to expected demand for this period: target \u2248124 \u2212 on-hand 8 = 116 units. This exceeds the OR's 76 recommendation to reflect the confirmed, sustained higher-demand regime. Summary of tradeoffs: Ordering 116 should satisfy expected Period 23 demand while keeping expected ending inventory near zero (minimizing holding cost). If demand surprise is higher (e.g., another 155), some stockout risk remains, but routinely ordering up to the highest spikes would incur large holding costs with no net profit advantage because profit per unit equals holding cost per unit.",

Therefore actual lead time = 0 and an order placed in Period 24 will arrive during Period 24 and can be used to satisfy Period 24 demand. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. Demand analysis: OR's recommendation (82) relies on long-run historical mean and the promised lead time, but recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime. Recent realized demands: Period 19\u201323 = [122, 111, 155, 117, 121], 5-period average = 125.2. Longer recent windows (Periods 17\u201321 avg \u2248123.4) and the carry-over insights indicate demand has risen and stabilized around ~120\u2013125 units per period. Cost structure: profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* \u2248 0), meaning no built-in safety stock beyond expected demand in a pure newsvendor sense. Given lead time = 0, holding cost equals profit, and the clear regime shift to ~125 units, the prudent action is to order up to expected demand for the upcoming period rather than follow OR's lower long-run recommendation. Calculation: Target demand \u2248 125 (5-period recent avg). Required order = max(0, target_demand \u2212 on_hand \u2212 in_transit) = 125 \u2212 3 \u2212 0 = 122 (rounded to integer). Decision: Place order for 122 units so arrivals during Period 24 plus current on-hand cover expected demand, minimizing stockouts while avoiding excess multi-period holding since holding cost is high relative to profit. Risk notes: If demand unexpectedly falls back toward historical mean, holding cost is high and we will incur holding penalties; however, the sustained 3+ period signals and carry-over insights justify prioritizing service to capture profit opportunities and avoid frequent stockouts.

On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0 in the current decision phase, so any order I place now (Period 26) will arrive during this period and be available to meet Period 26 demand (promised lead time = 0 is confirmed by concluded history).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent demand has moved to a higher regime and the shift was previously recorded in carry-over. Look at the most recent realized demands (Periods 22\u201325): 117, 121, 126, 137 \u2192 average = 125.25 units. This is materially above the OR's baseline which appears damped by older historical samples. The last 4 periods show sustained elevated demand, consistent with earlier confirmed upward shifts (Period 22 insight).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation reconciliation: OR recommends 89 units (it uses longer history and the promised L without recency weighting). That recommendation understates current demand by ~36 units (\u224829% below the recent 4-period average). Given lead time = 0, we can respond immediately to the higher regime rather than waiting.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk tradeoffs (profit vs holding cost): Profit = $1/unit, holding cost = $1/unit/period. Excess ending inventory directly reduces reward at the same rate as sold units add it, so over-ordering is costly. Conversely, under-ordering forgoes $1 profit per lost sale. With symmetric unit profit/holding, ordering to match expected demand (with modest conservatism for demand variability) maximizes expected reward. Recent 4-period mean = 125.25; demand variability in recent periods is moderate but the sample is small.\\n\\nFinal decision: Order 125 units. Rationale: this brings on-hand during Period 26 to roughly match the recent realized mean (125.25) and therefore maximizes expected sold units while avoiding unnecessary ending inventory given the 1:1 holding penalty. It is an explicit upward adjustment from OR's 89 to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime and confirmed zero lead time (so order arrives this period).\\n\\nImplementation notes for future periods: continue to prioritize recent-period averages (Periods 22\u201325 and onward) for forecasting while watching for signs the regime reverts; because lead time = 0 we can adjust immediately next period if demand moves.",

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all available stock for Period 31 must come from the order we place now. Recent realized demand has clearly trended upward; the most recent three demands (Periods 28\u201330) are 135, 161, and 132, with a 3-period average \u2248 143 units. Earlier window (Periods 25\u201327) showed 137, 90, 107 (avg \u2248 111) and earlier windows were lower; carry-over insights capture a sustained multi-period demand increase through Period 22 and beyond. OR recommendation (94 units) is based on older/historical samples and the promised lead time; with confirmed lead_time=0 and a clear upward demand regime, following OR would almost certainly cause a stockout this period. Strategy and final quantity: Because profit = holding cost (q = 0.5 \u2192 no statistical safety stock) ordering roughly the short-term expected demand is appropriate; I will order the recent 3-period average \u2248 143 units to meet expected Period 31 demand while avoiding persistent overstock.

Step 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: OR's recommendation (96) is based on older historical averages and a base-stock with z*=0 (profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile 0.5). Recent realized demand is substantially higher than OR's inputs: Period 29\u201331 actual demand = 161, 132, 165 (these are measured demands, not censored sales), with a 3-period average \u2248152.7. The last 3 periods therefore show a sustained higher regime than the earlier confirmed regime (~123.4 for P17\u201321). Step 3 \u2014 Risk trade-offs: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per period, so safety stock is costly and the classic fractile suggests minimal buffer. However, since lead time = 0, ordering to match expected single-period demand minimizes lost-sales opportunity without tying up multi-period inventory. Step 4 \u2014 Order decision: I will order to cover an estimate of single-period demand derived from the most recent sustained regime (P29\u201331 average \u2248153). That gives a high service level for the current period while avoiding multi-period holding. Step 5 \u2014 How this adjusts OR: I override OR's 96 up to 153 because OR underestimates the now-sustained demand surge.

Recent realized demand is substantially higher than the original historical samples: last 5 periods (P28\u2013P32) demands = 135,161,132,165,116 \u2192 avg \u2248 142 units. The more conservative 3-period window (P30\u2013P32) is 126,165,116 \u2192 avg \u2248 136; the 4-period window (P29\u2013P32) avg \u2248 143.5. Given the sustained regime of elevated demand since Period 29 (carry-over insight already recorded) I use a recent-window mean \u2248 142 units as the best point forecast for next-period demand.\nOR recommendation comparison: OR suggests 59 units because it uses older historical averages and the promised lead time; that recommendation is well below recent realized demand and would produce stockouts. With equal profit and holding cost (profit = $1, holding = $1) the critical fractile q=0.5 => z*=0, so no extra safety stock beyond the demand forecast is required under symmetric costs.\nFinal ordering decision and reasoning: With L=0, we must have (on-hand + order) \u2248 next-period demand. Forecast \u2248 142 units; on-hand = 37, so order = 142 \u2212 37 = 105 units (rounded). This brings available inventory to \u2248142 when the order arrives same period, matching expected demand and minimizing stockouts. I avoid adding extra safety stock because holding cost equals profit (discourages overstock) and we already see stable same-period supplier performance. This quantity overrides OR's 59 units because OR underestimates the current elevated demand regime.\nRisk notes: If demand reverts downward quickly, holding cost is high so we will carry extra inventory; however, the recent 5-period average (\u2248142) and the documented regime shift (Periods 29\u201331 and onward) justify this higher order to avoid repeated lost sales.",

With lead time = 0, there is no pipeline delay\u2014an order placed now will immediately cover Period 34 demand.\n\nDemand analysis: Recent actual demand has risen and been sustained at a higher level. True recent period demands (Period 31\u201333) are 165, 116, and 179; the 3-period average = (165+116+179)/3 \u2248 153.3 units.

Given the sustained pattern, I expect single-period demand for Period 34 to be roughly 150\u2013154 units.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 99 units based on older historical samples and promised lead time assumptions. OR's base-stock (with q=0.5 given profit=holding cost) targets the empirical mean under its assumptions; however, OR does not weight recent sustained regime shifts and therefore underestimates current demand by ~50%.\n\nDecision rule applied: With profit = holding cost, the newsvendor critical fractile is 0.5 \u2192 safety factor z* = 0, so the risk-balanced order equals the point estimate of next-period demand. Because lead time = 0, we should order approximately the expected single-period demand. I choose to match the recent 3-period mean to capture the sustained higher regime while avoiding systematic overstocking.\n\nFinal action: Order 153 units (rounded from 153.3). This replaces OR's 99 because OR understates current demand; ordering 153 units should cover expected demand (~153) without excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so there is no coverage for incoming demand other than what we order now.

Given the sustained elevated demand for many periods (several consecutive periods above 150), OR's 106 would almost certainly produce a large stockout and lost sales. Cost trade-off: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit per period, so overstocking is expensive and we should not carry large ending inventory, but we also want to avoid frequent stockouts given the sustained higher demand. Action logic: with lead time = 0 we can place an order to match expected near-term demand without adding pipeline uncertainty. I weight the recent 5-period average (\u2248165) as a robust short-term forecast (less sensitive to one very high spike) and choose that as the order quantity to capture most expected sales while limiting excess holding cost.

The most recent periods (P41\u2013P44) demands: 142, 193, 166, 181 (mean = 170.5). Expanding to P38\u2013P44 shows consistently elevated demand in the ~160\u2013199 range. Variability (recent SD ~19 units) implies occasional spikes above the recent mean (we observed a 193 in P42). The OR baseline of 115 units is based on older historical averages and the promised lead time; it is far below recent realized demand and would guarantee a large stockout this period.\n\nOR recommendation critique: OR's capped base-stock (115) understates the current demand regime because OR uses older historical samples and promised lead time without recognizing the sustained regime shift upward. With lead time = 0 and no pipeline, we should respond to the current realized demand level rather than OR's lower recommendation.\n\nFinal ordering strategy: Place an order to cover expected demand this period plus modest buffer for variability. Using recent mean \u2248170.5 and one standard-deviation buffer (~19) would target ~190, but to balance holding cost (equal to profit) versus stockout risk I select a conservative buffer below 1 SD. I order 180 units: this covers the recent mean (\u2248170.5) and provides ~9.5 units of upside buffer toward the observed spike of 193, while limiting excess holding cost if demand dips.\n\nExplicit decision: Increase OR's recommendation from 115 \u2192 180 units because (1) actual lead time = 0 so order arrives in time, (2) recent sustained demand mean \u2248170.5 with significant volatility, and (3) lack of any on-hand or in-transit stock makes undershooting particularly costly this period.\n\nRisk notes: If demand unexpectedly falls this period we will incur holding cost on any unsold ending inventory (holding cost = $1/unit/period), but given the equal profit and high recent demands, avoiding a stockout now (and consequent lost profit) takes priority.\n",

Therefore actual lead time = 0 (orders placed now will arrive in the same period and can be used to meet current-period demand).\n\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand is substantially higher than the original historical sample mean; recent five-period demand (Periods 42\u201346) = [193, 166, 181, 201, 144], average = 177 units. The OR baseline (84 units) uses older historical averages and the promised lead time; with profit = holding cost = $1, the OR's critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0), which yields a base-stock near the mean but it appears the OR is understating current single-period demand given the clear, sustained high-demand regime observed since Periods ~29\u201341 and continuing.\n\nDecision logic: With lead time = 0 we can order to cover the expected single-period demand directly. To avoid stockouts (lost sales reduce profit opportunity) while minimizing holding cost (holding cost equals profit per unit), target inventory after arrival \u2248 expected demand for this period. Use recent 5-period average demand = 177 as our expected demand. Required order = expected_demand - on_hand = 177 - 33 = 144 units.

Given equal profit and holding cost, matching expected demand is the profit-optimal conservative choice.\n\nRisk notes: If demand in the coming period falls below 177, we will incur holding cost on leftover inventory (holding cost = profit per unit, so overstock penalizes equally).

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1) Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows every order from Period 1\u201347 arrived in the same period (arrived message indicates lead_time 0 each time). Therefore actual lead time = 0 periods and orders placed now will arrive in Period 48 before demand is realized. This means I can rely on immediate replenishment and there is no pipeline to protect against.\n2) Inventory position: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. With lead_time = 0, the only way to have stock for Period 48 demand is to order now.\n3) Demand outlook: Recent realized demands are much higher than the original historical sample. The most recent five periods (P43\u2013P47) demands = 166, 181, 201, 144, 198 with average = 178 units. The last 3\u20137 periods consistently show a high-demand regime centered well above 150. This aligns with prior carry-over insights indicating a sustained upward demand regime established earlier (no reversal sign).\n4) OR recommendation check: OR suggests 118 units, but OR uses older historical averages and the promised lead time; it underestimates current realized demand. Because profit = holding cost ($1 = $1), the critical fractile is 0.5 and the OR baseline naturally produces minimal safety stock; that would lead to high stockouts this period given current demand.\n5) Final action logic: With lead_time = 0 and zero on-hand, we should order approximately the best estimate of one-period demand. Using the recent 5-period average (~178) and favoring slightly rounded, operationally simple quantity, I increase OR's 118 to 180 units to meet expected demand while avoiding unnecessary overstock. This balances units_sold (profit) against holding cost given uncertainty; ordering 180 aims to capture most demand while limiting ending inventory.\n6) Risk notes: If demand unexpectedly drops back toward historical lows, holding cost will penalize excess inventory; however, current multi-period evidence supports maintaining higher replenishment until we observe a sustained drop. Monitor upcoming periods and update if three consecutive lower-demand periods appear.\n",

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time and arrivals: Concluded history clearly shows actual lead time = 0 periods for all prior orders (every order placed arrived the same period and was visible in that period's conclude). There are no in-transit or overdue shipments. Therefore an order placed now will arrive in Period 50 before demand is realized.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With L=0 and arrival within the same period, any positive order will immediately be available to satisfy Period 50 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook (data + OR): OR recommends 121 units based on older historical samples and the promised lead time. However actual recent demand is much higher than OR's baseline. Recent demands (Periods 47\u201349) = 198, 207, 193 \u2192 3-period average \u2248 199.3 units. The last nine periods (41\u201349) average \u2248178.6, showing a sustained elevated regime well above OR's baseline.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Cost tradeoffs and service objective: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1 per unit per period, which yields critical fractile q = 0.5 (indifferent between over- and under-stocking based purely on one-period expectation). Given the high recent realized demand and zero lead time, the pragmatic objective is to meet expected current-period demand to capture profit and avoid lost sales (stockouts directly reduce Profit \xd7 units_sold with no salvage benefit). Holding cost will only apply to any leftover units into Period 51, but missing sales now is more harmful because demand is currently well above OR's estimate.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision: Order enough to cover the best estimate of Period 50 demand. I use the most recent realized demand signal (Periods 47\u201349 average \u2248199.3) and round to a whole unit. Therefore I place an order of 200 units. This overrides OR's capped recommendation of 121 units because OR underestimates the current sustained high-demand regime.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk and monitoring: Because holding cost equals profit, excess inventory is costly; if Period 50 demand falls substantially below 200, we will incur holding cost on leftover units. However the sustained elevated demands over many periods (especially 47\u201349) justify matching the near-term expected demand.
