Recent history shows a higher central tendency after Period_1; 5-period average = 49.6 \u2248 50 units. c) Lead time & missing orders: supplier promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). There are no in-transit shipments to flag as lost or delayed. Because promised L=0 implies we should cover (L+1)=1 period of demand, but actual lead time uncertainty argues against extreme over-ordering. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. We must cover current period demand which will occur after the decision. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit ($1), so overstock is costly; understock loses the $1 profit per unit sold. Given symmetric per-unit cost of over- vs under-stocking and the historical mean \u2248 50, a conservative order close to the historical mean balances service and holding costs. e) Final order logic: order enough to cover expected demand for the upcoming period (~50 units). This keeps service high while avoiding excessive ending inventory that would be charged the same amount as profit per unit.",

Recent realized demands: P37=171, P38=161, P39=200, P40=145. 4-period average = 169.25 units. c) Lead time / shipments: Concluded history shows all past orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed at Period 4 and repeatedly thereafter). In-transit=0 and there are no overdue/lost orders. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=17, in-transit=0. With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive during Period_41 (in time to satisfy Period_41 demand) and will be visible in the next conclude. e) Final order logic: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit/period.

Required additional units = expected_demand - on_hand = 169.25 - 17 \u2248 152. Use a conservative rounding to an integer and avoid upward padding given high holding cost.
