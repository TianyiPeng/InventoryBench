Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no 'Period 0 conclude' messages so no observed arrivals or lead-time evidence. Historical demand samples available: [130,122,106,108,71]. Promised lead time = 0 and there is no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), which implies target service quantile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480) so the OR backend will target the mean demand over the review+lead period. Because there is no confirmed changepoint in demand or lead time and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time, I use the default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameter estimation conservative and lets the OR engine apply its capped ordering policy given the promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Recent conclude shows the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=108, ordered on Period 1, lead_time=0), so observed lead time = 0 and matches the promised lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Period_1..Period_5 = 130,122,106,108,71) produce a multi-period mean ~107.4 with moderate variance. No evidence of a sustained change in demand or missing shipments (only one concluded order and it arrived on time). Therefore: estimate lead time by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to confirm L=0 from data; use default demand sizing (mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to use the full-sample mean across the review+lead period; and use default volatility (sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend anchored to the full-sample demand statistics while reflecting the confirmed zero lead time, balancing service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_3. Demand context: historical samples for chips(Regular) are [130,122,106,108,71] \u2192 mean = 107.4 units/period, std \u2248 22.65. Two concluded arrivals (Period1 and Period2 orders) both show lead_time = 0, so actual lead time is consistent with the promised 0 so far. Current inventory: on-hand = 75, in-transit = 0. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 so z* = 0 and base_stock = mu_hat. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 0). I also use default demand estimates so the OR backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 107.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2248 22.65. With base_stock \u2248 107.4 and current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 75, the policy will order to raise pipeline toward ~107.4 (subject to cap). This balances service level and holding cost appropriately given symmetric profit/holding and no evidence of a regime shift or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent concluded history shows orders in Periods 1-3 all arrived with lead_time=0 (evidence: Period1 arrived (lt=0), Period2 arrived (lt=0), Period3 arrived (lt=0)). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no pipeline coverage for current-period demand; expected demand is volatile (concluded demands: 118, 35, 140). I choose L='calculate' so the backend infers average observed lead time (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the three most recent observed demands (captures current volatility and avoids diluting with older samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) so safety-stock reflects observed short-run variability. These choices prioritize matching fast lead time (so orders can be used same period if promised) while sizing base-stock and safety stock from the most recent realized demand pattern to balance service and holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 all arrived the same period (lead_time=0). On-hand = 68, in-transit = 0 (no arrivals pending). Demand history samples available: [130, 122, 106, 108, 71] (mean 107.4). Given consistent same-period arrivals in the concluded history, I infer actual lead time = 0 and select L using the calculate method to reflect observed lead times. For demand forecast I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (with L=0 this equals the sample mean \u2248107.4). For uncertainty I use the default method so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices rely on the full-sample mean/variance because there is not yet a clear, sustained regime change in demand (the recent low of 71 is a single-period drop). Using the observed lead time=0 keeps replenishment responsive (lower pipeline), while the default mu/sigma balance service level vs holding cost by reflecting overall historical variability rather than overreacting to a single low period. This will let the OR backend compute base stock and cap consistent with promised lead time and historical demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders P1\u2013P4 each arrived same period as ordered)

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: confirmed short lead time environment (previous conclude messages show all orders P1\u2013P5 arrived same period). Recent realized demands (Period_1\u20135) average 107.4 units with noticeable variability (std ~20.25). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for Period 6 demand. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm same-period arrivals, so I use the default lead time. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service (use full-sample mean to avoid under-forecasting given several high-demand periods) against holding cost (profit and holding cost are equal, so the backend will compute a conservative z). Using defaults leverages all available data and the confirmed 0 lead time to let the OR engine set base_stock and the capped order quantity accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 context: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders P1\u2013P6 all arrived same period). On-hand = 27, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical demand samples provided for forecasting are [130,122,106,108,71] (mean = 107.4, sample std \u2248 22.64). Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded arrivals, so I use default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with reality. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples (L=0 \u2192 mu_hat = mean of all samples = 107.4; sigma_hat = std of all samples \u2248 22.64). Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z* = 0) so base-stock will be the mean demand; this balances service level vs. holding cost by targeting a 50% service quantile. Using all-sample statistics is appropriate because demand history does not show a sustained regime shift (recent variability is noisy but not a 3+ period sustained change). The chosen parameters give the OR backend a stable forecast while accounting for the confirmed zero lead time and current on-hand inventory when computing orders.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (provided) for chips(Regular) are [130,122,106,108,71], mean=107.4, population std\u224820.25. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) consistently shows orders arriving same period they were placed (lead time observed = 0 each time). Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded messages, so use default lead time. I choose default for L to keep the model aligned with the supplier promise and observed behavior. For mu_hat I choose default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = mean demand per period (107.4) which sets base-stock roughly at expected demand given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z=0). For sigma_hat I choose default so the backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u224820.25 to reflect observed variability. With profit=$1 and holding=$1, the backend\u2019s service-level target is 50%; these parameters instruct the OR engine to order to the mean demand level, balancing stockouts vs. holding cost. Given current zero on-hand/in-transit, this will prompt orders to bring inventory up toward expected period demand while avoiding excess safety stock because lead time is 0 and demand variability is moderate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 decision. Recent observed demand is variable but shows no sustained regime change; last 5 concluded period demands (Periods 4\u20138) = [30,131,73,104,64], mean ~80.4. On-hand=34, in-transit=0 and confirmed lead time=0 (arrivals occur same period ordered), so we expect no incoming units during this decision and must cover current-period demand plus target service level. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. For demand forecast I select recent_N (N=5) to focus the base-stock on the most recent demand regime (captures the recent higher variance and elevated spikes). For sigma_hat I also select recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to set base stock near the recent mean demand (~80 units) with safety stock driven by recent volatility\u2014balancing service (avoid stockouts given spikes like 131) against holding cost given current on-hand of 34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows every order arriving same period it was ordered, confirming actual lead time = 0. Demand history is noisy but available across many periods; the longer-sample mean provides a stable anchor. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) implying a 50% critical ratio, so the OR backend will target the mean demand across the review+lead period. Given no new sustained demand regime change or lost shipments, I choose the default methods so the backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps target base stock conservative and avoids overreacting to recent volatile spikes while the confirmed lead time=0 ensures same-period replenishment will cover demand if ordered. With on-hand and in-transit at zero, the backend will replenish up to the computed base stock to balance service level and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P10) consistently show arrived=ordered and each conclude states lead_time=0; this confirms actual lead time = 0. Demand history (available samples and the concluded periods) shows no sustained regime change or spike \u2014 recent demands fluctuate but do not indicate a new stable mean. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) implying critical ratio q=0.5 (z*\u22480), so the OR will target roughly the forecasted mean demand across the review+lead period. I therefore set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in the confirmed 0-period lead time. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the base-stock near the empirical mean and avoids overreacting to short-term noise given no strong changepoint. This choice balances service (meet expected demand) and holding cost (avoid excess inventory) under equal profit/holding costs and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 decision with on-hand=1 and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages through Period 11 consistently show orders arriving same period they were placed (Period 1\u201311), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history (Periods 1\u201311) has fluctuated but centers near ~90\u2013100 units with no sustained upward or downward shift (no 3+ period regime change); recent low-demand spikes (Periods 2 and 4) and high spikes (Periods 3 and 5) appear as noise. Given confirmed lead time=0 and stable long-run demand, use default forecasting: let the OR backend compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps orders responsive to current realized demand (same-period arrivals) while avoiding over-committing inventory given holding cost equals profit. No explicit upward adjustment is needed because arrivals are reliable and there is no sustained demand increase.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Recent demand samples (from supplied historical demand data) have mean \u2248107.4 and moderate variability; game history (Periods 1\u201312 conclude) consistently shows orders arriving same period as placed, so actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. Current inventory: on-hand=37, in-transit=0. With lead time = 0, incoming orders arrive within the same demand period so we can rely on same-period replenishment to meet demand; however on-hand 37 is well below recent single-period demand (~107), so OR should replenish aggressively to restore service level. I choose default methods so the OR engine uses the promised lead time and full-sample demand stats to compute base_stock and capped order sizes, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (q = 0.5 => median service target). No evidence of a new sustained change in lead time or demand regime that would warrant deviating from defaults.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown in environment seed) and full conclude history (P1\u2013P13) show frequent same-period arrivals and demand that averages roughly ~100 units with intermittent dips. Carry-over previously confirmed actual lead time = 0. Given zero observed transit inventory and consistent same-period arrivals across many periods, I will trust promised lead time (L=0). Using default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) is appropriate because demand shows no sustained regime shift across the long history\u2014variability exists but not a sustained change for 3+ periods requiring a recent_N or EWMA adjustment. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) implying a critical fractile q = 0.5; that pushes the OR base-stock toward the mean rather than extreme safety stock. Default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) captures overall volatility for the backend to calculate safety buffer. These choices keep service levels near the mean while avoiding excess holding cost given current on-hand inventory (34) and zero in-transit: they instruct the OR engine to replenish toward an average-period stock level consistent with historically-observed demand and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201314) consistently show orders arriving the same period they were placed, confirming actual lead time = 0. Demand history across Periods 1\u201314 has mean \u2248 86.5 units/period with substantial variability (spikes to ~140 and troughs ~30\u201335). Given lead time = 0 and no outstanding pipeline, the OR base-stock should target roughly one period of demand plus safety stock. I therefore use: L=default to trust the promised lead time (supported by 14 periods of same-period arrivals); mu_hat=default so the backend uses the full-sample mean scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat=default so the backend uses the full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the forecast stable (uses all available data), leverages confirmed lead-time=0, and lets the OR engine compute the z* service level tradeoff (profit = holding cost) so the order balances service vs. holding cost. With on-hand=10 and no in-transit, this will prompt ordering to refill toward the base-stock computed by the backend.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period = 16. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to meet upcoming same-period demand because concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Historical demand in recent periods (P11\u2013P15 = 96, 60, 61, 83, 96) shows a lower recent mean (~79.2) than the older 5-sample prior. To keep the base-stock responsive to the recent regime while the confirmed lead time remains 0, I use: L=default (promised lead time = 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (covers the review+lead period of length 1), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This choice reduces risk of overstock from older high-demand periods while preserving service by sizing to recent observed demand; with profit=holding cost, the backend will set z*\u22480.5 and the capped ordering limit will prevent extreme orders if variance is high.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201316) consistently shows orders arriving same period (lead_time=0) \u2014 earlier carry-over insight confirmed actual lead time = 0. Recent demand spike in Period 16 (178) caused a stockout, but the spike is a single-period event following otherwise moderate demands; no sustained demand regime shift of 3+ periods is evident. Given consistent same-period arrivals, I use the default lead time (promised L=0) so the OR engine uses its known lead-time. For demand forecast and volatility I select default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) based on the provided historical samples; this balances service level against holding cost while letting the OR engine apply the exact profit/holding tradeoff. No overdue or lost shipments to adjust for. If the high demand in Period 16 repeats in future periods (3+ periods), I will record a demand-regime change and switch to a recent_N or EWMA forecast.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show variability with two very high demands in Period_16 (178) and Period_17 (168) but this increase is not yet a sustained 3+ period shift. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history (Periods 1\u201317) repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 0; no overdue or lost shipments visible. To balance service (avoid stockouts given recent high demands) against holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1 -> q=0.5 so moderate safety stock), I bias the demand forecast toward recent observations while remaining conservative. Therefore: use L = default (promised 0). Use mu_hat = recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent 5 demand observations (periods 13\u201317) and reflect the upward movement without overreacting to only two high periods. Use sigma_hat = recent_N with N=5 so variability is also estimated from the same recent window. These parameters give the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled recent mean and std to compute base stock and cap, increasing orders modestly to reduce expected stockouts while limiting extra holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201318 arrivals matched same-period orders). Recent demand shows a clear upward shift starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201318: 178, 168, 155) vs prior history; this is a sustained 3-period increase. To respond quickly to the new higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock tight (profit = holding cost), I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0, corroborated by concluded arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N on the most recent 3 periods (the detected new regime) so mu_hat = (1+L) * mean(last 3 demands) \u2014 this captures the elevated demand level. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher volatility in the new regime. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the confirmed demand spike and avoid underordering given 0 lead time and zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 87.13 (Periods 1\u201315) to 167.0 (Periods 16\u201318), +91.6%, sustained for 3 periods

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: on-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (Periods 1\u201319). Demand history shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 16: demands in Periods 16\u201319 are elevated (178,168,155,114) versus earlier periods. I therefore keep L at the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I focus on the recent high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201319). I choose recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (using the last 4 observed demands) so the base-stock reflects the higher recent mean and avoids understocking. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=4 to capture recent volatility specifically in the new regime rather than diluting with older low-demand variability. This configuration raises the base stock to service the higher demand while keeping holding exposure constrained by using only the sustained recent regime data. Given profit=holding cost, the backend will use the implied critical fractile of 0.5; my parameters ensure the backend's base-stock is driven by the updated recent mean and variance to improve service while avoiding unnecessary long-term holding from older low-demand periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: on-hand=9, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm lead time=0. Recent demand has a sustained higher regime starting Period 16 (Period16\u201320 demands: 178,168,155,114,145; mean=152.0). On-hand + pipeline (9) is far below one-period expected demand (~152), so we must raise the target inventory. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed historically). For demand I detect the changepoint at Period 16 and therefore use recent_N with N=5 (regime length = 5 periods, N = max(min(5,20),3) = 5). This uses (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demands = 1*152.0 = 152 as mu_hat input to the OR engine. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 (std of last 5 demands \u2248 24.7 sample std, or \u224822.1 population std) so the backend captures increased variability in the new regime. These choices push the OR backend to a higher base-stock (covering the elevated demand regime) while keeping L=0 avoids overestimating pipeline needs. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit=0) against holding cost by relying on recent-regime statistics rather than older low-demand history.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201321 demands: 178,168,155,114,145,131 \u2192 recent mean ~148). On-hand=21, in-transit=0 so we are exposed to stockouts this period if demand remains high. No overdue shipments visible; historical concluded lead times consistently 0. I therefore use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast I target the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201321) using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current mean over the last 6 periods; same N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters guide the OR backend to raise the base-stock to cover the higher post-change demand while sigma based on recent volatility sets safety stock to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period through Period 22). Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime beginning at Period 16 (Periods 16\u201322 are noticeably higher than Periods 1\u201315). To be responsive to the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost equal to profit ($1/$1), I choose to use the promised/default lead time (L=0) since arrivals have been reliably same-period. For demand sizing I focus on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 16\u201322) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of the last 7 samples. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=7 so sigma_hat captures variability in the same recent regime. These choices keep the OR backend\u2019s base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while avoiding smoothing with older low-demand data; using recent demand reduces stockouts in the higher regime but still respects holding cost by limiting overreaction to single-period spikes.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 decision. Current on-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods P1\u2013P23 arrivals all concluded same period ordered). Demand has a sustained higher regime beginning at Period 16; recent high-demand periods (P16\u2013P23) should drive the forecast. I therefore use L=default to trust the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 16\u201323) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean across the last 8 periods and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture the current higher volatility. This raises the base-stock level to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new regime and keeps the OR backend from underordering given on-hand=22 and no pipeline. The higher sigma_hat increases safety stock to protect service levels; because holding cost equals profit ($1 each), the backend's quantile balances fill-rate vs holding cost appropriately.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P24 arrivals all same-period), so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning at Period 16 (higher demand from Periods 16\u201324). To capture the new regime I use recent_N for demand parameters, focusing on the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201324, length 9). Chosen parameters: L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically), mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to set the (1+L)-period demand forecast using the last 9 periods of demand (captures elevated demand since Period 16), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This raises the base-stock to better meet the higher demand while keeping safety stock grounded in recent variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 decision: on-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201325) show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (many arrivals same-period) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_16. Recent demand (Periods 16\u201325) average = 148.2 units/period with sample std \u2248 20.5. Given promised lead time=0 and sustained higher demand for 10 periods, I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new regime while avoiding overreacting to single-period noise. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concludes consistently confirm same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I pick recent_N with N=10 (the length of the confirmed high-demand regime, 16\u201325) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using these ten most recent high-demand samples (mean\u2248148.2, std\u224820.5). This raises base-stock to meet the new higher demand while sigma from the same window controls the safety-stock sizing. With profit = holding cost, the backend will choose a moderate service quantile; using recent data reduces stockouts from the higher regime while limiting excess holding from older low-demand history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded periods show consistent actual lead time = 0 (arrivals always same period) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 with higher demand through Period 26. No overdue shipments or missing arrivals to reconcile. Given promised lead time = 0 and confirmed actual lead time = 0, I use L = default to keep review+lead horizon = 1 period. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201326) because the mean there is materially higher and has persisted for 11 periods; I therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility rather than diluting with older, lower-demand variance. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), implying an approximately 50% critical ratio; using recent demand mean and variance raises base stock to reduce stockouts in this higher-demand regime while the equal holding cost tempers overstock. These choices prioritize avoiding lost sales given current zero inventory and no in-transit stock.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201327 arrivals all same-period), and a sustained demand regime shift was confirmed starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201327 mean demand ~148.5). Current demand in the new regime (last 12 periods, Periods 16\u201327) shows mean \u2248148.5 and std \u224818.6. Because the higher-demand regime has persisted for 12 periods, I use a recent_N approach (N=12) for demand mean and variability so the OR backend targets service for the new level rather than diluting with pre-shift low demand. L is set to default (promised lead time = 0), matching the confirmed same-period arrivals. With pipeline=0 and only 13 on-hand, the system needs orders sized to cover the (1+L)-period forecast (about 148.5 units) minus on-hand; using recent_N will raise the base-stock to avoid frequent stockouts given profit=holding cost ($1:$1). Sigma recent_N captures the observed volatility (~18.6) to set the safety-stock portion appropriately. No overdue or lost shipments are currently present (arrivals have been reliable).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 with on-hand=19 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed many periods). Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime starting Period 16 (as previously recorded). Recent realized demands (Periods 24\u201328 = 145, 143, 163, 137, 130) average 143.6 and reflect the post-shift regime. Given profit= $1 and holding=$1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 so z* = 0 and the OR backend will target mu_hat as the base-stock. To keep the policy responsive to the elevated, stable demand level while limiting excess holding (we currently have low on-hand and no pipeline), I choose L = default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent post-shift observations (Periods 24\u201328 mean \u2248 143.6). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. This produces a base-stock roughly equal to the recent mean demand (~144 units) which balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost because z*=0 neutralizes extra safety stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P29) show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16. Recent realized demand (Periods 16\u201329) averages ~149.93 units/period; volatility in that window is material. Given zero promised lead time and consistent concluded arrivals, I use the default lead-time (promised = 0) so the OR engine knows arrivals are expected same-period. For demand I anchor on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N over the last 14 periods (Periods 16\u201329) to capture the higher mean (\u2248150) and recent variability. Sigma is also computed from the same recent window so the backend's cap and safety-stock calculation reflect current volatility. This approach keeps base-stock roughly at the new higher demand level (service level implied by profit=holding gives q=0.5) while letting the capped order limit use the observed recent std to avoid extreme over-ordering.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16 (recorded in carry-over). Promised lead time has been consistently realized as 0 (confirmed earlier, arrivals each period), and current inventory is On-hand=45, In-transit=0. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals through Period 30 consistently show lead_time=0. Demand after the regime shift (Periods 16\u201330, 15 samples) has mean \u2248147 units/period; to target the new regime I use a recent_N forecast for the review+lead period (N=15) so mu_hat reflects the post-change mean rather than older low-demand data. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=15) to capture the volatility in the same recent regime. With profit=holding, the critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0), so base_stock equals mu_hat; using recent data keeps service high for the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods. Given On-hand 45 and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order toward the updated base stock to cover expected demand this period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. History shows actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier) and most recent conclude messages (through Period 31) show same-period arrivals. Current inventory: on-hand=59, in-transit=0. There is an earlier documented demand regime shift (Periods 16\u201318) to a higher mean that has persisted through subsequent periods; recent demands remain elevated relative to Periods 1\u201315. Given lead time=0, no pipeline will arrive after this decision before demand occurs, so we must rely on on-hand plus order placed now. I choose the default methods: L=default to use the promised lead time (which matches observed 0), mu_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (this captures the full historical sample including the sustained higher-demand periods) and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These conservative, data-driven defaults let the OR backend compute the base-stock and cap using the full sample statistics and the known profit/holding tradeoff, balancing service level and holding cost given there are no in-transit units to rely on.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201332) consistently show arrivals same period as orders \u2014 actual lead time confirmed = 0 (sustained). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean through Period 32). To reflect the post-change demand regime I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=17 (covering Periods 16\u201332, the detected high-demand regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 17 samples; this captures the new sustained higher mean and avoids dilution by the low pre-Period-16 data. For volatility I also use recent_N N=17 to reflect variability in the current regime. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the target service quantile is moderate; these parameters steer the OR backend to hold inventory tuned to the elevated recent demand while limiting excess holding from older low-demand periods. This also addresses the zero on-hand/in-transit by basing orders on the current high-demand regime rather than long-run average.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Current on-hand is 1, in-transit 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P33). Demand history since Period 16 shows a sustained higher regime vs. Periods 1\u201315; recent demands remain elevated though somewhat variable. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time 0 (confirmed by concluded history). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend weights the most recent regime (Periods 29\u201333: demands = 187,105,88,144,143) rather than older low-demand data; N=5 is small but \u22653 and captures the latest demand pattern. This keeps the base-stock targeted to recent realized demand, helping avoid large stockouts from under-forecasting while not accumulating excess inventory given holding cost = profit. Using recent sample-based sigma helps the OR engine size the safety stock to recent volatility rather than overstating variability from older periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201334) consistently show arrivals same period as orders \u2192 actual lead time confirmed 0 (matches prior carry-over). A demand regime shift occurred at Period 16 (sustained higher demand from P16 onward). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1 (critical balance q=0.5), I select: L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals; mu_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the permanently higher demand (N=19 covers Periods 16\u201334 regime length), so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of these recent samples; sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=19 to estimate volatility from the same regime. These choices ensure the base-stock targets reflect the confirmed higher mean demand while basing safety stock on recent variability to avoid overstocking from older low-demand history. With on-hand=0 and no pipeline, this will instruct the OR engine to order toward a base-stock tuned to the new regime to restore service quickly without long-run excessive holding costs.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 context: recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201335, 20 samples). On-hand = 12, in-transit = 0 so we are vulnerable to stockouts this period if demand remains at the elevated level. Lead time observations are consistent: every concluded order (P1\u2013P35) arrived same period it was ordered, so actual lead time remains 0. Demand changepoint evidence: Periods 1\u201315 average demand \u2248 87.13 (from prior insight) vs. Periods 16\u201335 average \u2248 148.5 (+70.4%), a sustained increase across 20 periods. To target service while limiting holding cost (profit = holding cost = $1), I bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime. Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the new regime (use the 20 most recent high-demand samples). This increases base-stock and safety stock appropriately so orders + on-hand cover current period demand and avoid lost sales, while sigma estimated from the same recent window prevents overreacting to single large spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly since Period 1 and noted in carry-over), so I use the default (promised) lead time L=0. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning at Period 16 (carry-over: Period 16\u201318 increase sustained onward). To capture the post-change demand level while remaining robust to noise, I use recent_N over the most recent ~20 post-change observations (Periods 17\u201336 cover the stable high regime; regime length >20 so I cap N=20). Thus mu_hat uses recent_N N=20 to set the (1+L)\xd7mean over the latest high-demand regime, and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet the new higher demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability; using L=default (0) avoids overestimating pipeline needs given confirmed same-period arrivals. The choice balances service (avoid stockouts given higher mean) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than all-history averages.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Recent history shows confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) throughout the trace; no overdue or missing shipments. On-hand = 50, in-transit = 0 so pipeline inventory is low relative to recent demand. There was a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (higher mean sustained since), so I bias estimates toward the post-change regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 actual lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (the last 20 demand observations, Periods 18\u201337) so the forecast reflects the higher post-change average (mean of those 20 samples \u2248 137 units). With profit = holding, the critical fractile is 0.5 so the base stock target \u2248 mu_hat; using the recent mean avoids overstating demand from older low periods. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility (so safety stock is calibrated to the post-change variance). This combination keeps service high for the new higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding cost given on-hand inventory and zero in-transit units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Context: promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201338) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 (no change). Current inventory: on-hand=63, in-transit=0. Demand regime: earlier carry-over confirmed a sustained demand increase beginning Period 16 (Periods 16\u201318 and sustained thereafter). To capture the post-change demand level I use recent_N methods anchored on the most recent regime. Method choices: L set to default (promised 0) because concluded history strongly confirms lead time = 0. For mu_hat I select recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the elevated demand regime while smoothing short-term noise). For sigma_hat I also select recent_N with N=20 so volatility is estimated from the same recent window. These choices provide the OR backend a forecast that reflects the higher, sustained demand since Period 16 while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed arrivals; this balances service (avoiding stockouts given the higher demand) against holding cost by using a recent-window estimate rather than the full-history mean which would understate current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201339) show actual lead time consistently 0 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (higher mean). Current inventory: on-hand=66, in-transit=0. With promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals showing lead_time=0, I keep L as default (use promised lead time = 0). Demand forecast: because the higher-demand regime that began at Period 16 is sustained through the most recent periods, I use a recent_N estimate to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint data. Regime length from Period 16 through Period 39 is 24 periods; per the rule N = min(regime_length,20) so N=20. Thus I ask the OR engine to compute mu_hat based on the mean of the last 20 demand samples (scaled by 1+L) and sigma_hat based on the std of the last 20 samples (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This emphasizes recent, higher demand and avoids dilution from the low-demand early periods. Rationale vs. objectives: using recent_N increases forecasted base_stock (raising service level) to avoid stockouts given the sustained higher demand; capping and the backend's quantile-based safety stock will limit overshooting and control holding costs. Keeping L=default avoids misstating lead time because all concluded evidence confirms 0-period actual lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: on-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201340) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier at Period 5) and recent arrivals have been reliable. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so the OR backend will compute a service-level quantile q = profit/(profit+holding)=0.5; using default lead time and full-sample demand stats is appropriate unless a sustained regime change is observed. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). I also choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, using the full historical demand series it has. This balances fill-rate and holding cost given equal profit/holding: the backend will target the median forecasted pipeline demand. With on-hand=56 and no in-transit, the backend ordering rule (base_stock \u2212 pipeline, capped) will determine an order to replenish toward that median-based base stock while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost parity.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201341) consistently show arrivals same period as orders; lead time has been confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201341) has moderated versus the spike around Periods 16\u201329, so there is no new sustained demand regime change requiring action. Because promised and observed lead time = 0, I use the default lead-time treatment to let the OR engine rely on the full historical sample set. I also select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples: this leverages all available demand history, keeps the base-stock responsive to the confirmed zero lead time, and avoids overreacting to short-term noise. Given current low on-hand and zero pipeline, this will prompt the OR engine to order up toward the base stock to restore service while the backend's cap will limit extreme order sizes and control holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_43 decision. On-hand=20, in-transit=0 \u2192 low immediate cover; promised lead time=0 and historic conclude messages consistently show arrivals same-period (lead time confirmed 0), so use default lead time. Demand regime shifted up around Period_16 and has persisted; to keep the base-stock tuned to the higher, recent demand pattern while reflecting recent volatility, I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (this captures roughly the most recent 20 demand periods within the sustained higher regime). Using recent_N=20 biases the OR backend toward a higher base_stock (protecting service level under the new regime) while sigma_hat recent estimation avoids overstating variability from older low-demand periods\u2014helping balance profit (unit margin = holding cost) against holding costs. This setting also respects that there are currently no in-transit units and lead time = 0, so replenishment will arrive same period it is ordered according to promises.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. Current on-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods consistently (all concluded arrivals for prior periods arrived same period ordered). Recent observed demand (Periods 39\u201343 = 68, 75, 75, 95, 74) is substantially lower than the elevated regime seen around Periods 16\u201333. Given on-hand inventory is moderate (49) and no pipeline, I bias the forecast toward the most recent demand regime to avoid excess holding cost (holding cost = profit so service-level target is moderate). Therefore: L uses default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed zero lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest lower-demand mean across the next (1+L) review+lead period; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility and keep safety stock aligned with recent variability. These settings steer the OR base-stock toward recent demand, limiting overstock while maintaining service given immediate arrivals and no in-transit units.

Daily Profit: $62.00, Daily Holding Cost: $22.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=0 throughout (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent realized demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 75,108,95,74,62) has been substantially below the earlier high-demand spike around Periods 16\u201330. To avoid over-ordering given zero in-transit and equal profit/holding ($1/$1 -> neutral service/holding tradeoff), I use the promised lead time (default) and a short recent-window demand estimate so the OR engine targets current lower demand. Therefore: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5-period average demand times (1+L). sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while avoiding large inventory holding costs given profit=holding.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through Period 45) consistently show orders arriving same period they were placed\u2014actual lead time confirmed 0 across many periods. Recent long-run demand includes a sustained regime shift upward around Period 16 (noted in carry-over), but demand since then has varied. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), implying critical fractile q=0.5 and a neutral safety-stock (z*=0). I therefore use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend relies on the known 0-period promise; I also use default demand and volatility aggregation so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock anchored to the full-sample mean while avoiding overreaction to recent variability; with q=0.5 that yields no extra safety stock and balances service vs. holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Current on-hand=61, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201346) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), so using default lead time is appropriate. There was a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (higher mean since then); to reflect the higher recent demand I base demand parameters on the most recent regime. I choose recent_N with N=20 (capped at 20) which captures the latest 20 demand observations (covers the post-shift behavior) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N focuses the backend on the elevated, stable-demand regime and avoids dilution by older low-demand periods. With profit = holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1) the backend\u2019s service-level target is ~50% (z\u22480), so supplying approximately the recent-period mean for (1+L) periods balances stockouts vs. holding. Because on-hand is 61 and in-transit is 0, the OR engine will compare pipeline to the recent-demand-based base stock; this approach reduces unnecessary overstock from older low-demand history while preserving service through the sustained higher-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (documented previously). Current on-hand=38, in-transit=0 (no overdue or missing shipments visible). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals, so I use default lead time to let the OR backend assume L=0. Given the confirmed demand regime shift (higher mean since Period 16) I focus forecasts on the recent regime rather than long-run pre-shift data: I select recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (20 is the max window recommended by rules: min(regime_length,20), and the regime length since Period 16 is >20). This concentrates the base-stock calculation on the most relevant post-shift demand mean and variability, reducing stockouts while avoiding excessive inventory driven by older low-demand periods. With profit=holding cost, the OR backend will set service quantile q=0.5; using recent mean and std helps balance service level and holding cost given the sustained higher demand. No signs of lost shipments to adjust lead time explicitly.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P48) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=0; therefore use promised/default lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u201348) has mean \u2248108.5 units/period; there was a sustained regime jump around Period 16 (already recorded in carry-over), but recent demand has continued at the higher level, so using the default all-samples forecast is appropriate and stable. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each) \u2192 critical ratio q=0.5, so the backend will pick z*=0 and base_stock \u2248 mu_hat (no extra safety). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat tells the OR engine to target the long-run mean demand (balancing service level vs. holding cost) while keeping safety stock minimal given equal profit/holding costs. This also avoids overreacting to short-term noise while on-hand inventory (20) provides partial coverage for current-period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. Current on-hand = 36, in-transit = 0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201349) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed previously in carry-over). Recent demand has been moderate (last 4 demands: P46\u2013P49 = 50, 68, 82, 73) but a sustained higher-demand regime was already recorded at Period 16 and remains in the history. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each) so the service fractile q = 0.5 (z* = 0) and the OR backend will target the estimated demand across the review+lead period. I choose stable, conservative defaults so the backend uses all historical samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the long-run post-shift demand profile) and L = default (promised lead time, which matches observed lead time=0). This avoids overreacting to short recent dips and leverages the confirmed lead-time=0 signal; with on-hand=36 and no in-transit, the OR engine will compute the required order to bring pipeline+on-hand to the base stock. No signs of lost shipments or new sustained regime shifts in the last 3+ periods, so no explicit adjustments.
