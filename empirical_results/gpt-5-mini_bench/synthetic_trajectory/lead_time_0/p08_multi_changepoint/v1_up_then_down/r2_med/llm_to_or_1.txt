Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean = 107.4 units/period (samples: 130,122,106,108,71), sample std \u2248 20.25. Promised lead time is 0 and there are no concluded arrivals to suggest a different actual lead time or lost shipments. With no strong evidence of a changepoint or seasonality and starting from zero inventory, use the default lead-time and demand estimators so the OR backend applies the baseline base-stock calculation: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples. This keeps orders aligned with historical demand while avoiding over-reacting to a short 5-period history and prevents premature carry-over insights.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Observations: on-hand=9, in-transit=0. Profit=$4, holding=$1. Promised lead time=0 and Period 1 conclude shows the P1 order arrived in P1 (arrived=127, lead_time=0) \u2014 evidence that actual lead time = 0 for the observed shipment. Historical demand samples available (chips(Regular)): [130, 122, 106, 108, 71] with mean 107.4; Period 1 observed demand was 118 (consistent with the sample range). Given no multi-period shift in demand or repeated delays, I will use the backend defaults: keep L as promised (default) and use the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps the base-stock calculation anchored to long-run demand while the OR engine's cap limits order size; with on-hand=9 and no in-transit, this will prompt the optimizer to replenish toward the long-run expected demand without overreacting to a single-period fluctuation. If future conclude messages show delayed or lost shipments or a sustained demand shift (3+ periods), I will switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=92, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times: Period 1 arrival (ordered P1) lead_time=0; Period 2 arrival (ordered P2) lead_time=0 \u2014 consistent evidence that actual lead time = 0. Historical demand samples provided (130,122,106,108,71) give mean \u2248107.4. Given no clear recent changepoint in demand and two consecutive confirmations of 0-period lead time, I set L using calculated observed lead times to reflect actual behavior. I choose default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the backend will compute service-level quantile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 and set base stock to balance fill rate vs holding cost. Current on-hand (92) plus zero in-transit means we have less than the long-run mean demand (~107), so the backend will likely order to top up toward the base stock. This approach is conservative: it uses full-sample estimates (no overreacting to two recent low realized sales) while acknowledging confirmed short lead time so arrivals are expected same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived in the same period (observed lead_time=0 for each concluded order), so there is no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Demand context: historical sample series for chips(Regular) = [130,122,106,108,71] (mean=107.4). Promised lead time is 0; observed lead times match the promise. I choose L='default' (use promised lead time=0) because concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals. For demand I choose mu_hat='default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 1*107.4, capturing the full-sample mean without overreacting to recent variability. For sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) which reflects observed demand variability. With L=0 and full-sample mu/sigma the backend will compute a base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost while not overreacting to the single low outlier (Period_5=71) or the single high demand event in concluded history; this is appropriate given no sustained regime change or lead-time shift. I also note the immediate operational issue: on-hand+pipeline=0, so the OR policy will likely order to refill toward the computed base stock to meet next-period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [130,122,106,108,71] (mean=107.4, std\u224822.64). All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time = 0 in Periods 1-4 (orders placed arrived same period). Current on-hand = 103, in-transit = 0. Profit = $4, Holding = $1 \u2192 service quantile q=0.8 so backend will set safety factor accordingly. Reconciliation: expected single-period demand \u2248107.4, so on-hand (103) is roughly one period of demand but slightly below the mean; with promised lead time = 0 and no in-transit, we should target a base stock built from the full-sample mean to balance service level vs holding cost. No evidence of a sustained regime change (demand has not shifted for 3+ consecutive periods) and lead time has been consistently 0, so I choose default methods to let the OR engine compute base_stock from full-sample stats. This keeps orders responsive while avoiding overstock given holding cost = $1/unit/period.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-5) shows consistent same-period arrivals: observed lead_time = 0 in all concluded messages. Demand history provided for chips(Regular) samples: [130, 122, 106, 108, 71] with mean = 107.4 and sample std \u2248 20.25. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no overdue shipments to reconcile. I select L using 'calculate' because all concluded lead-time observations (Periods 1\u20135) average to 0, matching the promised lead time and providing evidence that actual lead time is currently 0. For demand parameters I use the default methods so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 1*107.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = 1*\u224820.25. This keeps the forecast anchored to the full-sample demand estimate (conservative given recent volatility) and lets the OR engine set the base-stock and cap using the profit/holding cost tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1 yields a relatively high service level q). Using defaults avoids overreacting to the recent low period (71) while the consistent zero lead-time observation supports trusting same-period replenishment for service level calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20136) shows arrivals for orders placed in the same period (observed lead_time = 0 each concluded period), and demand samples available from the provided dataset have mean ~107.4 units (samples: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71). Current inventory: on-hand=60, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history consistently supports same-period arrival, so I use the default lead time to let the OR engine assume the promised 0. I select default demand and volatility calculations so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This yields a target base-stock near the historical mean demand (~107 units) which balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost: it reduces overstock risk while aiming to cover the upcoming period\u2019s demand. Given on-hand=60 and no pipeline, this will prompt the OR engine to order toward the computed base stock to restore service level while keeping holding costs controlled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. On-hand=26, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1\u20137 all show arrived=(ordered on same Period) \u2192 observed lead_time=0 consistently. Demand context: recent concluded demands (sold) = [118, 35, 128, 30, 130, 73, 104] while the provided historical demand samples (used for demand stats) are [130, 122, 106, 108, 71]. Given stable observed lead time and no evidence of lost shipments, use promised lead time (default) so the OR backend uses L=0. For demand forecast and volatility use defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock from the data and the profit/holding tradeoff; my on-hand (26) plus zero in-transit means orders placed will top up to the backend-calculated base-stock. No explicit upward adjustment is made because recent demand variability includes both high and low weeks and we lack a sustained regime shift in demand that would justify explicit or recent_N overrides.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Periods 1\u20137 orders arrived same period as ordered).

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u20138) = [118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64], overall mean = 86.9 units/period, recent 5-period mean (Periods 4\u20138) = 80.4 units/period. Carry-over confirmed lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period in Periods 1\u20138). Given promised/observed lead time 0, the OR backend should target a single-period forecast. I select L="default" to use the promised lead time (0) which matches observed behavior. For mu_hat I choose recent_N with N=5 to emphasize the most recent demand regime (Periods 4\u20138) where demand averaged ~80.4 \u2014 this keeps the target base-stock modestly below the longer-run mean given recent slightly lower demand. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N with N=5 so the safety-stock reflects recent volatility rather than older, more extreme samples. These choices balance service (matching recent demand) against holding cost: a shorter-lookback reduces overstock risk when recent demands are lower, while recent volatility informs the z\xb7\u03c3 tradeoff in the OR backend.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: all concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows actual lead time = 0 consistently (arrivals same period as ordered). Recent demand samples: [130,122,106,108,71] (Periods 1\u20135) seeded initial stats; continuing periods (6\u20139) also show high variability with several stockouts (Periods 3 and 5 and 9 ended at 0). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish enough to cover this period's demand plus safety. Promised lead time = 0 and confirmed by concluded messages, so use default lead time to keep backend aligned with on-site behavior. I choose default demand/volatility estimates (backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)). Rationale for defaults: sample set across periods is limited but stationary enough without a sustained regime shift (no 3+ period demand change pattern); using defaults lets the OR engine apply the base-stock formula with proper service-level quantile given profit/holding costs. Using defaults also avoids overfitting short-term dips/spikes and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start: on-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u201310) have mean = 91.1 units/period and show high variability (samples range 30\u2013140). Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period historically). Product economics: profit = $4, holding = $1 so service quantile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 (OR backend will convert to z\u22480.84). Given reliable same-day arrivals and no outstanding in-transit stock, I keep lead time at the promised value (L = 0) so the OR engine can target a one-period (current period only) demand forecast. I select default demand and volatility methods so the backend uses all historical samples to compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) \u2248 91.1 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances a relatively high service level (driven by profit) against holding cost while acknowledging recent demand variability. Keeping defaults (all-sample estimates) is appropriate because there is no sustained regime shift in the last 3+ periods that would warrant a recent_N or EWMA change, and lead time has been consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $354.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows same-period arrivals every period; carry-over already recorded confirmation of lead time = 0 at Period 8. Current on-hand = 30, in-transit = 0, so available inventory before Period 12 demand = 30. No overdue or missing shipments observed. I select L=default to keep promised lead time 0 because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-period lead time. For demand forecast I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this is appropriate because demand history shows variability but no sustained, significant regime shift (no 3+ period change requiring recent_N or EWMA). These choices balance service level vs holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates while keeping lead time short (L=0) to avoid over-ordering due to perceived pipeline delays.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 context: on-hand=65, in-transit=0, no outstanding arrivals visible. Recent demand (Periods 8\u201312) = [64, 113, 103, 96, 60], mean \u2248 87.2, sample std \u2248 23.8. Carry-over history shows all observed lead times = 0 (concluded Periods 1\u201312), so same-period replenishment is confirmed. I set L using 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed lead-time average (confirmed 0). With no pipeline and same-period arrivals, we must cover only the current period's demand when ordering; therefore I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (stable last 5 periods) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (std \u224823.8). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent average demand (~87 units) while sizing safety stock from recent variability to balance the $4 profit per unit against $1 holding cost. Using recent data avoids being overly influenced by older periods that had different demand patterns.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision. Current on-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u201313) show a clear recent downshift vs. earlier samples: the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 113, 103, 96, 60, 61) average ~86.6, noticeably below earlier-period levels. No shipments are overdue (arrivals have consistently concluded same period). Promised lead time is 0 and prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0, so I use the default lead time to keep the OR model aligned with supplier promise and observed behavior. For demand I choose recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (N=5 is the last regime length and provides a balance between responsiveness and noise). I also choose recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat so the backend measures volatility from the same recent window. This configuration reduces target base-stock relative to long-run averages (lowering expected holding cost) while the profit/holding ratio (profit $4 vs. holding $1) implies a relatively high service-level target; using recent demand figures keeps service targeted to current demand, avoiding overstock. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time deterioration to warrant an explicit L change.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 decision with confirmed lead time = 0 (historical concludes P1\u2013P14 show arrivals same period). Current on-hand=25, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods 1\u201314) average \u224886.5 units/period, so with L=0 the review+lead demand is roughly one period's demand. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (confirmed by arrivals). I choose mu_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean demand \xd7(1+L) (robust to noise and uses all available history). I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by \u221a(1+L). These settings request a base-stock around the long-run mean demand while letting the OR engine compute the safety stock tradeoff using the profit/holding cost ratio; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given observed ~86.5 demand) with holding cost given current on-hand=25 and no pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: observed steady same-period arrivals historically (carry-over: lead time confirmed 0 at Period 8) and current on-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 provided earlier) and many concluded periods show single-period demands varying but no sustained regime shift. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals consistently confirm L=0, so I use the default lead-time setting to let the OR backend use the promised lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I select default methods so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples respectively \u2014 this leverages the full sample history (no clear recent changepoint requiring adaptation) and balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. Using defaults keeps the OR base-stock calculation stable given confirmed 0 lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations; with on-hand=24 and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order up to the computed base stock as needed.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201316) show all placed orders arrived the same period they were ordered \u2014 consistent confirmed lead time = 0. Recent demand shows variability including a single large spike in Period 16 (178) but no sustained regime change (need \u22653 periods). Given no evidence of lost shipments and a stable zero lead-time pattern, use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times = 0). For demand forecasting use the default methods (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because there is no sustained changepoint; this balances service level and holding cost by letting the OR engine derive the base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This also avoids overreacting to the single-period spike. With on-hand=0 and no in-transit, these settings let the OR engine replenish to target base-stock immediately (L=0), providing rapid recovery while the profit/holding cost tradeoff sets the safety stock.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (Period 1\u201317 orders arrived same period). Historical demand across conclude messages shows typical period demand around ~100\u2013130 with occasional spikes (not yet a sustained regime change). Given same-period arrivals (L=0) and no evidence of a sustained demand shift (needs \u22653 periods), I select default estimators so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This leverages all available data to compute base_stock and the capped order while the backend internalizes profit vs holding (profit=$4, holding=$1) into its service quantile. Using defaults is conservative: it avoids overreacting to recent spikes and relies on confirmed lead-time=0 so orders will arrive same period as placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Recent demand has jumped sharply in the last 3 periods (P16\u2013P18) while on-hand and in-transit are both 0, so we must replenish to cover immediate high demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods previously (carry-over) so using default promised lead time is appropriate. Demand signal: last 3 periods demand = {P16:178, P17:168, P18:155} \u2014 this is a sustained spike vs the prior history. Because profit ($4) >> holding cost ($1) the critical service quantile is high (q\u22480.8), so the OR engine should target a higher base stock reflecting the recent regime. I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime (recent_N, N=3) to capture the elevated mean and volatility; L uses default (promised lead time 0) since arrivals historically have matched that. This combination signals the backend to raise the base-stock (and the cap) to reduce likely lost sales given the sharp, sustained demand increase, while not overstating the horizon because lead time is 0. If shipments arrive as expected this will restore on-hand quickly; because holding cost is moderate, prioritizing service is justified given the >100% demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 87.13 (Periods 1\u201315) to 167.00 (Periods 16\u201318), a +91.9% increase, sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Profit=$4, Holding=$1. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201319 arrivals same day), so use default promised L=0. Demand shows a clear regime shift beginning Period 16 (Periods 16\u201318: 178,168,155 \u2014 sustained high demand for 3 periods). Period 19 cooled to 114, but the most recent sustained high regime length=3 suggests we should size orders to the elevated demand to avoid stockouts. I therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures Periods 16\u201318 high-demand regime) so base-stock targets the higher mean; sigma_hat also recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in that regime. Using recent short-window estimates raises the base-stock and service level (increasing units sold/profit) while the holding cost ($1) is moderate relative to profit ($4), so favoring service is appropriate. This also addresses the lack of in-transit inventory (0 units) and immediate need to cover current-period demand after decision.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201320) consistently show orders arriving same period they were placed \u2014 confirmed lead time = 0 across many periods. Demand history shows a sustained upward regime beginning Period_16 (previous carry-over), so I will bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime. Profit per unit = $4 and holding cost = $1 implies a high target service level (q = 0.8), so we should favor meeting demand while limiting excess holding. Given limited on-hand (25) and no pipeline, I set L to default (use promised lead time of 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 16\u201320) to capture the new regime while smoothing short blips (114 in P19). Using the last 5 periods balances responsiveness to higher demand with stability. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These parameters will instruct the OR backend to raise the base-stock toward the recent higher mean demand while keeping safety stock consistent with observed recent variability, improving service in the new regime without excessively increasing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $482.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 context: on-hand=42, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show lead time=0 (confirmed earlier). Demand increased starting Period 16 and that regime persisted through Period 21 (demands in P16\u2013P21 = 178,168,155,114,145,131). Because the elevated-demand regime is sustained (\u22653 periods) and most relevant for near-term forecasting, I choose recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime length of 6 periods (Periods 16\u201321). I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concludes confirm same-period arrivals. Using recent_N (N=6) focuses the backend on the current higher mean and observed variability, raising base-stock to improve service while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff under the current sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time 0 confirmed) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16 (Periods 16\u201322 demand: 178,168,155,114,145,131,173). Because there are no overdue shipments, we must order to cover immediate next-period demand. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded history firmly confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 16\u201322) because a clear changepoint at Period 16 created a sustained higher-demand regime; N=7 equals the regime length (bounded by the rules). Using the recent 7-period mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples) centers the base-stock on the new normal rather than diluting with pre-change low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-change volatility. This combination raises the target base-stock and the OR backend's order cap appropriately to prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high critical fractile \u22480.8) while keeping holding costs considered via sigma and the cap. No shipments appear lost and no additional lead-time extension evidence exists, so we do not increase L explicitly.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show confirmed lead time 0 (carry-over). Recent periods (P16\u2013P23) exhibit a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier periods (demand mostly 114\u2013178). Given confirmed same-day arrivals, use promised/default lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime I base demand forecast on the most recent regime: use the last 8 concluded demand observations (Periods 16\u201323) so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 8) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 8). This keeps replenishment responsive to the higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory since holding cost is meaningful. The higher service quantile implied by profit/(profit+holding)=4/(4+1)=0.8 is supported by using recent data to reduce stockouts under the new regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. Current on-hand = 24, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201324) consistently show arrived=ordered same period, so actual lead time remains confirmed as 0 in history. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (previously recorded carry-over): sustained elevated demand around ~155 on average in later periods. With no pipeline and low on-hand, we should target the OR engine's default demand estimates so it uses all historical samples and the known promised lead time. Therefore: L set to default (use promised 0). mu_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) capturing the full historical average including the higher-demand regime. sigma_hat set to default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) reflecting observed volatility. These choices let the OR engine compute the base stock balancing profit vs. holding cost while relying on full-sample statistics; using defaults is conservative given the confirmed lead time and the already-recorded demand regime shift. No new lost shipments observed.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 decision. Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201325) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period) and a demand regime shift was previously recorded at Period 16 (higher mean ~167). No shipments are overdue or lost. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (matches confirmed actual lead time=0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(demand samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) using the full history; this leverages the confirmed lead time and the full sample set (including the sustained higher-demand regime) to set a base-stock that balances the increased service level requirement (due to higher demand) against holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; confirmed actual lead time = 0 (historical concludes show same-period arrivals). There is a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (higher mean sustained through Period_26). I will set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concludes consistently confirm same-period arrivals. For demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N focused on the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher recent mean and variability. Regime spans Periods 16\u201326 (11 periods), so N=11 (per rules N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock toward the new higher demand, reducing stockouts (important because on-hand and in-transit are zero) while keeping safety stock calibrated to observed recent variability to limit excess holding cost. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by targeting service driven by the new regime rather than the older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (Periods 16\u201327 demand series used for recent estimates). On-hand=30, in-transit=0 \u2014 current stock is far below the recent elevated demand level (recent mean \u2248148.5 units per period over Periods 16\u201327). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (orders arriving same period), so I use the promised/default lead time to keep ordering consistent with operations. To reflect the confirmed regime shift I use recent_N (N=12) for both demand mean and volatility, capturing Periods 16\u201327 (length 12) where demand has been persistently higher. This increases the base-stock target to service the new higher demand while the OR backend will apply the service-level cap. Sample calculations for transparency: last 12 demands = [178,168,155,114,145,131,173,130,145,143,163,137], mean \u2248148.5, sample std \u224818.6. Using recent_N ensures the OR engine targets availability for the new regime rather than being diluted by the earlier lower-demand periods. No new lead-time or seasonal anomalies detected; carry-over insights already confirm lead time=0 and the Period-16 demand regime shift.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly through Period 28), so I rely on the promised lead time. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (documented previously) \u2014 recent periods (16\u201328) remain at the elevated level, so I bias forecasts toward the recent regime rather than the full-sample mean. Therefore: L = default to keep the OR engine using promised lead time (0). For demand center and volatility I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 16\u201328 inclusive = 13 samples) to capture the post-changepoint regime and avoid dilution by earlier low-demand samples. This ensures the backend's base-stock target reflects the higher recent mean (improving service and capturing profit) while sigma from the same recent window reflects current variability. Given current on-hand=35 and no pipeline, these parameters will lead the OR engine to replenish toward a higher base-stock appropriate for the new regime while the cap prevents extreme single-period orders and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201329 consistently arrived same period). Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16 (sustained higher demand). Recent demand (Periods 16\u201329) represents the current regime and should drive the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility. Reconciliation: no pipeline and zero on-hand means we must restock to cover current-period demand plus safety stock. Choices: L set to default to respect promised lead time (0) and because concluded history confirms 0. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=14 (Periods 16\u201329) to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime; this makes the base-stock reflect the current higher mean demand rather than older low-demand data. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=14 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime, yielding safety stock aligned with observed variability. These settings help the OR backend produce a base-stock that raises service level for the higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by ignoring older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: on-hand=63, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Profit $4 / holding $1 implies a high target service level (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) so the OR engine will bias toward higher base-stock. Historical data and earlier carry-over show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean sustained \u2265 3 periods). I therefore avoid using the full-sample mean (which mixes low pre-shift demand) and instead set demand estimates based on the recent, post-shift regime. Method choices: L="default" because every concluded period shows actual lead time = 0 and the promised lead time remains appropriate; mu_hat="recent_N" with N=15 to capture the post-shift regime from Period 16 through Period 30 (regime length = 15 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples; sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=15 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than inflated historical variance from the earlier low-demand regime. Operationally this raises the base-stock to meet the higher customer demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability; with on-hand=63 and no in-transit, this reduces stockouts in the immediate period while limiting unnecessary long-term holding costs by not over-weighting older low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Demand history through Period 31 shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16 (already recorded in carry-over) and many same-period arrivals confirming lead time = 0. Current inventory: on-hand=79, in-transit=0. Expected immediate demand still uncertain but historical mean across all 31 observed periods is ~116 units/period; promised lead time is 0 and confirmed repeatedly. I therefore select L = default to keep the OR engine using the promised (and empirically confirmed) zero lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose the default (use all samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full history; this leverages the large sample set including the post-Period-16 regime shift and avoids overfitting to very recent fluctuations. These settings will produce a base-stock that balances the profit/holding tradeoff using the full-sample demand statistics while respecting the observed zero lead time and current on-hand inventory (so orders will top up toward the statistically derived base-stock but capped by the OR engine's cap to limit over-ordering). No new missing-shipment or lead-time signals detected this period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 context: on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0 (Carry-over: confirmed at Period 8). There was a demand regime shift around Period 16 (recorded previously) raising average demand for a sustained window, but recent realized demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 28\u201332 demands = 130, 187, 105, 88, 144) shows a lower recent mean (~130.8) and moderate variability. With no pipeline and same-period replenishment (L=0), orders placed now will arrive in the same selling period, so I prioritize a recent-demand view. I therefore set L to default (use promised 0), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most-relevant recent demand level, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target stock responsive to the recent drop from the earlier elevated regime while maintaining service with same-period arrivals, balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201333) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly), so promised lead time=0 is reliable. A sustained demand regime shift was previously recorded starting Period 16 (higher mean sustained through latest data). To keep the forecast responsive to that higher regime and to protect service (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 target fill quantile q=0.8), I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 16\u201333 constitute an 18-period high-demand regime): this focuses mu_hat and sigma_hat on the post-shift regime to avoid understocking. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the higher target service level while letting the backend compute exact base_stock and cap; using recent data keeps holding cost in check by not overreacting to older low-demand periods. No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time changes was found in the conclude history.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent history shows actual lead time consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier and every concluded period orders arrived same period). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we currently have no coverage for this period's demand; orders will need to cover current period demand because arrivals are same-period. There was a clear, sustained demand regime change starting Period 16 (documented in carry-over): demand roughly doubled and has persisted for many periods. To keep service high while controlling holding cost, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For demand forecast I focus on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=19 (Periods 16\u201334) so the base-stock targets the higher, sustained demand level rather than the long-run pre-shift mean. For uncertainty I also use recent_N with N=19 for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects volatility in the same recent regime. This approach reduces stockouts from the higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods; using the recent samples balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201335) show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (higher mean demand sustained thereafter). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) because concluded history across many periods confirms actual lead time = 0; using the calculated average ensures the OR engine uses empirical lead-time rather than merely the promised value. For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201335 length \u224820); this focuses the base-stock on the current, sustained higher mean demand rather than older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime so safety stock reflects current variability. These choices balance service level vs holding cost by aligning demand and variability estimates to the confirmed higher-demand regime while respecting the confirmed zero lead time, preventing unnecessary extra pipeline stock given immediate replenishment.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37 context: on-hand=74, in-transit=0, profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 service quantile q=0.8 (high service bias). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (orders arriving same period through Period 36). A demand regime shift was previously confirmed at Period 16 (sustained higher demand since then). To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use a recent-window estimate covering the post-shift regime. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 20 demand samples, which captures the elevated-demand regime (Period 17 onward) while smoothing short-term noise; N=20 is chosen because the regime length since the confirmed changepoint is \u226520 and the rules cap N at 20. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 20 samples). These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to protect service given high profit-to-holding ratio and the sustained higher demand, while using recent data to avoid under-forecasting from older low-demand periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: confirmed lead time historically 0 (carry-over) and recent concluded history shows every order arrived same period. Current inventory: on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Demand regime: a sustained upward shift was detected at Period 16 and persists through Period 37 (higher mean since P16). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I use the promised/default lead time (0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-day arrivals. For demand forecast I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201337) using recent_N with N=20 (regime length \u224822 periods; per rules N = min(regime_length,20) = 20) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean demand across the review+lead period. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the higher demand regime while not inflating lead time; that balances higher profit-per-unit ($4) versus holding cost ($1) by aligning base-stock to recent realized demand and variance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 start: on-hand=87, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201338) consistently confirm lead time=0, so keep L as default. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period_16 (recorded earlier): demand averages rose and have persisted through Period_38. To reflect the post-changepoint demand level and recent variability, I use recent_N on the most recent data rather than the full-sample mean. I choose N=20 (the most recent 20 concluded periods) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This keeps the base-stock target responsive to the higher mean demand (improves service and sales) while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures current volatility to avoid excessive safety stock and holding cost. Given on-hand=87 and no in-transit, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to replenish toward a base-stock aligned with recent higher demand while capping orders per its cap calculation to control risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. History shows confirmed lead time = 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201339 all arrived same period). Current on-hand = 92, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has cooled from the mid-period peak (Period 16\u201333) and the last five demands (Periods 35\u201339 = 134, 94, 91, 75, 68) average ~92; with profit $4 and holding $1 the service target is high (q = 4/5 = 0.8) so we should size orders to cover roughly one period of near-current demand while avoiding excess holding. No overdue or missing shipments to account for. Therefore: keep L at default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (recent 5-period mean ~92, recent volatility reflects these five samples). This balances the backend\u2019s high target service level against holding cost given our on-hand of 92 (about one period of expected demand) and zero pipeline. If demand re-accelerates persistently, we will record a new carry-over insight and switch to a longer window.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arriving same period through Period 40). A demand regime shift to a higher mean was confirmed at Period 16 and has persisted; recent periods remain in the elevated regime. Profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 critical ratio q = 4/(4+1)=0.8, so the OR backend will target a high service level (larger z). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping volatility estimates recent and relevant, I set L based on observed lead-times (calculate) and use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the post-changepoint regime). This increases base_stock to reduce lost sales while relying on recent volatility to avoid excessive holding. Given no in-transit inventory and modest on-hand, this policy prioritizes service level consistent with the high critical ratio while using recent data to limit overstocking.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: on-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning at Period_16 (Periods 16\u201318 and onward higher mean ~167 vs ~87 earlier) \u2014 this shift is confirmed and persisted for many periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Given the confirmed higher-demand regime and long persistence, I bias demand estimates to the recent post-changepoint data. I select L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (use last 20 demand samples to capture current mean/variance). This raises the backend base_stock to meet higher demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability. The choice balances service level (profit-driven q=0.8) against holding cost by restricting estimation to the recent high-demand regime rather than diluting with older low-demand samples; using recent volatility prevents excess safety stock if demand variability has declined. With on-hand=51 and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order up toward the updated base stock to reduce stockouts in the high-demand regime while the holding-cost weight (used in q) limits overstocking.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 review: on-hand=63, in-transit=0. History (Periods 1\u201342 conclude) shows every concluded order arrived same period ordered (lead_time=0 consistently). Recent demand has been elevated relative to earliest periods (carry-over recorded previously: regime shift at Period 16), but demand since then is stable and we have 42 concluded samples with no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead time = 0 (sustained), so use the backend default lead-time handling. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history; this leverages the confirmed 0 lead time and full-sample statistics to produce the base-stock level. This balances service vs holding cost by letting the OR formula (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 -> high service target) set the safety-stock multiplier while avoiding overreacting to short-term fluctuations since the demand shift was already captured in carry-over insights. No in-transit units to reconcile; orders placed now will arrive same period per confirmed lead-time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Historical conclusions show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period_16 (carry-over). Recent demand has remained elevated and variable compared with the very early periods. Given the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201343) I bias forecasts to recent history so the OR engine raises target base-stock to preserve service with profit/harm tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 high service target). I therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0, which is supported by repeated concluded arrivals); set mu_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent 20 periods of the higher-demand regime so the mean forecast captures the new normal; set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This balances avoiding costly stockouts (high profit per unit) while not inflating holding excessively by limiting lookback to the current regime. Inventory note: with 73 on-hand and no in-transit, the backend will compare pipeline+on-hand to the 1-period (1+L) forecast \u2014 using recent 20-period stats reduces underordering risk given the elevated demand since Period_16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (carry-over previously recorded). Current on-hand = 90, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is 90 for satisfying Period 45 demand. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (previously captured in carry-over) so I will let the OR engine compute base-stock using all historical samples rather than reactively truncating recent samples. Using default lead time keeps (1+L)=1. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend compute (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples, which balances service level driven by profit/(profit+holding) with holding cost. This is conservative given we already hold healthy on-hand inventory and no in-transit units; it avoids overreacting to single-period dips while the backend's capped order will limit order size if pipeline coverage is sufficient.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 status: on-hand=90, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201345) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (noted in prior carry-over), but overall history is long and varied. Given confirmed lead time = 0 and no new sustained change in demand in the most recent periods, I select the default calculations so the OR backend uses all observed demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This lets the backend estimate base-stock using full-sample statistics (stable long-run estimate) while the backend's cap will limit order sizes to reasonable levels. Using defaults balances service (profit-driven q \u2248 0.8) with holding cost given we already hold 90 units and have no in-transit units; defaults let the optimizer account for precise mean/variance and the policy cap automatically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand = 94, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201346) consistently show orders arriving same period ordered; confirmed actual lead time = 0. No recent sustained changepoint in demand beyond previously recorded shift (Period 16). Given lead time = 0, I keep the demand forecast and volatility calculation to the backend defaults so it uses the full sample history to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This lets the OR engine compute the base-stock with the correct service level (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1)=0.8) and the capped order policy. Keeping default mu and sigma avoids overfitting to short-term noise while relying on the confirmed lead-time=0 signal. With on-hand=94 and no pipeline, this will produce an order to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the base stock balancing service level vs holding cost.

Daily Profit: $272.00, Daily Holding Cost: $76.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Current on-hand=76, in-transit=0 so no incoming units visible; demand history shows many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0 (orders in Periods 1\u201347 all arrived same period), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Profit per unit = $4 and holding cost = $1 imply a high critical fractile (q = 0.8) so the OR engine should target a fairly high service level. Given stable confirmed lead time=0 and no clear new demand regime shift since the previously recorded shift around Period 16\u201318, I choose the default methods so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this leverages the full history to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, letting the OR engine compute the appropriate base-stock and cap to balance the high service requirement against holding cost. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to recent variability when we currently hold modest on-hand inventory and no inbound pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period repeatedly). Current on-hand=61, in-transit=0. There was a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (documented in carry-over): higher mean demand since then. To avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost moderate, I bias forecasts to the post-shift regime by using recent_N over the most recent regime. Following the regime-length rule (use up to 20 recent samples for a sustained regime), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std using the last 20 demand observations (this captures current elevated demand and recent variability). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concludes consistently show zero lead time. This choice increases target base-stock to protect service level given elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility to size safety stock; keeping L=default avoids overstating pipeline coverage which would reduce order quantities.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 start. Recent realized lead times have consistently arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed across history), so use promised/default lead time. On-hand=61, in-transit=0; demand over the last five periods (Periods 45\u201349 = 55,50,68,82,73) has averaged ~65.6 units, substantially lower than the mid-run spike seen around Periods 16\u201330. Pipeline is empty so we should size the (1+L)-period forecast to recent demand to avoid excess holding cost. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (mean \u224865.6) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. Using recent data reduces overstock risk while the backend will compute the appropriate service-level z* (profit/(profit+holding)=4/(4+1)=0.8). These choices balance service level versus holding cost given low current demand and no incoming shipments.
