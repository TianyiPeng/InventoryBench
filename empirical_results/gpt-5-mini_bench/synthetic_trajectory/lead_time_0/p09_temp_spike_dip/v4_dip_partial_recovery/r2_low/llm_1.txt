The 5-period average demand = 95.6 units/period. The series shows some variability but no sustained structural shift (values span 65\u2013136). c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown; no concluded arrivals in history to infer a different lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no coverage for current period demand. e) Final order logic: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals unit profit = $1/unit, so overstock is costly and we should avoid large ending inventory. We must cover current period demand (which occurs after ordering) but limit excess inventory. Using the 5-period historical average (~95.6), I order a quantity close to the expected demand for this period to maximize expected profit while minimizing holding cost.

Game history reveals Period 1 actual customer demand = 108 (sold constrained to 96 due to stockout).

This provides one confirmed observation that lead time can be 0. However, this is a single-period observation and not yet a sustained pattern per the carry-over rules. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 at decision time. With confirmed same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed in P1), an order placed now will arrive in Period 2 and be available to satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Final order logic: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit = $1/unit, so overstock yields no net upside and increases risk. To maximize reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), order to cover expected demand for this period only (minimize ending inventory).

The recent two-period trend is higher than the older provided sample sequence, so I weight the most recent periods more heavily.\n\nc) Lead-time / orders: Supplier lead time has been observed as 0 periods on both concluded orders (P1 and P2 arrivals occurred in the same period as ordering).

Some recent periods had stockouts (censoring), e.g., P41 and P47, so they may understate true demand. Lead time & pipeline: Supplier lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (orders arrive in same period), and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive in-period before demand. Cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1; holding cost per unit/period = $1. That means an unsold unit next-period yields -$1 holding which exactly offsets the $1 profit per unit if it had been sold \u2014 overstock gives no upside and risks reducing objective. Therefore we should target expected demand for this period, being conservative but slightly biased to avoid lost sales because stockouts for this high-margin (relative to zero net for overstock) scenario still provide net positive when sold. Forecast & order: use recent uncensored average \u2248 68 units, round to a whole unit and add a small buffer for potential censoring (observed censored periods suggest true demand could be a bit higher).
