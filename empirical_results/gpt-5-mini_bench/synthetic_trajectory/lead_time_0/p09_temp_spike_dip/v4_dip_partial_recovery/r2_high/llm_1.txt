Recent two periods show higher demand (106,136) suggesting a possible upward shift; overall 5-period average \u224896, recent 2-period average =121. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT is unknown and must be inferred from conclude messages; no concluded arrivals seen yet and there are no in-transit units, so treat effective LT conservatively as \u22650 (risk of LT\u22651 or lost shipments). d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because arrivals (if any) will occur after decision and we cannot rely on immediate confirmations, we should cover current-period demand (occurs after decision) plus at least one additional period to protect against LT>=1. e) Final order logic: Given high per-unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/period) and the recent uptick in demand, target coverage = 2 periods of expected demand. Use a conservative expected demand \u2248120 units/period (recent 2-period average). Order = 2 * 120 - (on-hand + in-transit) = 240 units. This balances service level (capture profitable sales) versus holding cost while leaving room to revise when actual arrivals/lead-time are observed.",

Average demand over P1\u2013P3 = (108+144+142)/3 = 131.3 units. There is evidence of a higher-demand regime in the last three periods relative to the first period, and two periods (P2,P3) had true demand >140. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Orders placed in Period1 and Period3 both arrived the same period and their conclude messages state lead_time was 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1, P3 order arrived P3). No in-transit inventory is shown now. Therefore actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0.

A prior carry-over noted a higher-demand regime in P1\u2013P3 (avg 131.3). The last period (P4=84) dipped but is a single low observation; the recent multi-period evidence still supports a baseline near the 130s rather than the low 80s. c) Lead time / pipeline: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (orders placed arrive within the same period).

Using recent evidence and the documented Period_5 sample demand (136) and the P1\u2013P3 regime (~131), a reasonable target for Period 5 demand is in the 130\u2013136 range. To meet expected demand while keeping ending inventory modest, I will order enough to bring available inventory close to that target: target \u2248 136, available now = 61, so order = 75.

Earlier periods (P1\u2013P3) were much higher (108,144,142) but demand has softened in the last three periods. The full six-period average is 104.5, showing a mix of a prior high regime and a more recent lower regime. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period in multiple observed periods).

With lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive during Period_7 and be available to meet Period_7 demand. e) Final order logic: Given high unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/period), the penalty for understock (lost high-margin sales) is large compared with holding one extra unit for a period. Balancing the recent 3-period average demand (~78) against some weight to the longer-run average (~105) and wanting to avoid stockouts, I choose a conservatively aggressive order to ensure service while limiting excessive ending inventory.

Earlier Periods 1\u20133 showed a higher regime (avg 131.3) but Periods 4\u20137 show lower and more variable demand (P4=84, P5=55, P6=94, P7=114).

There is no pipeline to cover demand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs. profit $19/unit; carrying small safety stock is inexpensive relative to missed sales. e) Final order logic: Use a recent-weighted forecast to balance responsiveness and noise.

The series fluctuates but centers in the 70\u201395 range. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any sales this period require placing an order now. Lead-time vs. orders: given confirmed 0 lead time (arrivals same period), an order placed this decision phase will arrive in time for Period 42 demand. Decision logic: because profit per sold unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1), it's profitable to err slightly on the side of stocking to capture sales.
