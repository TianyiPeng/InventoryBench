Historical demand samples give mean \u224899.8 units/period and sample std dev \u224832.45. Profit and holding cost are both $1/unit so the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 which yields z* \u2248 0, so the OR base-stock equals the mean demand (~99.8). OR's capped policy computed order \u2248100 units (cap is larger \u2248153 so it does not bind). Lead-time inference: no concluded messages are available to contradict the promised L=0, so I cannot reliably infer a lead-time shift or lost shipment risk this period. Inventory coverage target: given (L+1)=1 period coverage requirement, ordering ~100 covers expected current-period demand. Decision: follow OR recommendation and order 100 units. This balances expected demand (\u2248100) with equal profit/holding costs (neutral risk preference), avoids unnecessary holding cost from over-ordering, and leaves flexibility to adapt in future periods if arrivals or demand pattern shift.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: From 'Period 1 conclude' we see the Period 1 order arrived in Period 1 (arrived=100, ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0). This confirms actual lead time = promised lead time = 0 so far.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. There are no pending arrivals that will show up during this decision (arrivals for orders placed now would occur within the same period because L=0).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand analysis: Historical sample average (given samples: 118,130,72,58,121) = 99.8 \u2248 100 units/period. Period 1 observed demand was 114; we sold 100 because we started with 100 and stockout occurred, so realized lost sales indicate true demand at least 114 that period. Variability is meaningful (samples range widely), but profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, holding=$1) implying a critical fractile of 0.5 and minimal safety stock per the OR baseline.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation review: OR recommended 103 units (base-stock/capped policy using promised L and full history). That aligns with the long-run mean (~100) and OR's methodology. However, last-period demand (\u2265114) was noticeably above the long-run mean and produced a stockout; with zero on-hand and zero in-transit, ordering only 103 risks another stockout if demand repeats near 114.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision logic: Given confirmed L=0, immediate arrivals are possible; we should target roughly the recent realized demand to reduce lost sales while not overbuilding inventory (holding cost = profit, so avoid large overstock). A modest upward adjustment from OR's 103 to 115 covers last period's observed demand (114) and provides a small buffer for variability.\n\nTherefore I order 115 units for Period 2. This aims to prevent a repeat stockout while staying close to the OR baseline and acknowledging observed recent demand.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Summary of observations and inference:\n1) Lead time inference: Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=0; Period 2 conclude shows the Period 2 order arrived with lead_time=0. These concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods for the two observed periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). There are no missing or in-transit orders to worry about.\n2) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Because actual lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and can be used to satisfy Period 3 demand (which occurs after the decision).\n3) Demand outlook: Recent realized demands (Period 1 sold/demand ~114, Period 2 demand ~117) point to a single-period expected demand \u2248 115\u2013116. The longer-run historical five-sample mean (~99.8) is lower, but the most recent two periods are consistently ~115\u2013117, indicating a short-term upward level relative to the 5-period average.\n4) OR recommendation: OR recommends 105 units. OR's base-stock uses the empirical mean across all historical samples and caps orders; with profit=holding cost the critical fractile is 0.5 so safety stock is effectively zero. OR's 105 is below the recent two-period average (~116).\n5) Decision logic: With lead time = 0 and no pipeline, we should order to meet expected single-period demand. Given stronger evidence from the two most recent periods (114 and 117), I increase OR's recommendation to cover ~116 units so we avoid a near-certain stockout this period. The holding cost equals profit, so excess inventory imposes equal penalty as stockouts; but because the recent realized demand is materially above OR's recommendation, the expected lost sales cost outweighs the holding cost for ordering up to the recent mean. Ordering 116 balances meeting expected demand while not greatly overshooting the short-term signal.\nFinal action: order 116 units of chips(Regular).",

Step 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR capped recommendation = 92 units, slightly below my expected need (92 + 13 = 105 < 111).

Decision logic vs OR: OR recommended 32 units using its capped base-stock baseline (which uses older/history-wide stats and the promised lead time).

Promised lead time = 0 is confirmed in prior carry-over (Period 4) and the full history; I therefore treat lead time as 0 (orders arrive during the same period). Step 2 - Inventory position: On-hand = 47, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order I place this period will be available to meet this period's demand (after my decision but before demand realization). Step 3 - Demand outlook: Recent demand has been lower than the early-period peaks. Using the most recent five demands (Periods 15\u201319 = 134, 40, 33, 67, 46) the average demand = 64 units. This recent mean better reflects the current regime than the initial 5-sample list. Step 4 - OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 45 units using its capped base-stock. OR does not account for the confirmed 0 lead time and uses older/global history; it may therefore over-order given current lower mean and high holding cost. Step 5 - Profit vs holding tradeoff: Profit = $1, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile = 0.5 \u2192 minimal safety stock (z*\u22480). Because holding cost equals profit, excess inventory is costly and should be avoided. Step 6 - Final quantity calculation: Expected single-period demand \u2248 64. Required incremental units = max(0, expected demand \u2212 on-hand \u2212 in-transit) = max(0, 64 \u2212 47 \u2212 0) = 17 units. I will order 17 units to bring expected supply up to the recent mean demand while minimizing costly holding. Adjustment rationale relative to OR: I reduce OR's 45 \u2192 17 because (a) lead time = 0 so we can top up only what\u2019s needed for the single upcoming period, (b) recent demand average (~64) is lower than OR\u2019s implicit target, and (c) holding cost equals profit, so avoid excess stock. Step 7 - Risk notes: If demand spikes unexpectedly (e.g., back to 100+), my conservative order could cause stockouts; however historical recent periods show frequent low-to-moderate demand, making a conservative approach appropriate.

Recent demand has been below earlier high values and is somewhat variable; there is one spike (85) but the recent running average is ~56.\n- OR recommendation: 73 units (OR uses promised lead time and long-run demand history; with Profit=Holding cost, OR's critical fractile implies little added safety stock, but its cap raises the recommendation to 73). OR cannot detect lead-time differences or prioritize recent demand.\n\nDecision logic and math:\n- With L=0 and immediate arrival, we need enough order + on-hand to meet expected current-period demand. Using recent average demand \u224856 and given on-hand=14, the pure-mean shortfall \u2248 56 - 14 = 42 units.\n- Because variance is moderate and profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), I do not want large excess inventory that will incur holding cost equal to profit. However, one recent spike to 85 suggests a modest buffer is prudent.\n- OR suggests 73 (which would raise on-hand+order to 87).

This yields on-hand + arrival \u2248 14 + 60 = 74 available this period \u2014 slightly above the OR total coverage and comfortably above the recent average (\u224856) while providing modest protection against spikes (covers the 85 spike only partially, but better than ordering the minimal shortfall). It avoids the higher holding cost risk of matching OR's 73-order recommendation when demand appears lower on average.\n\nOperational notes to justify against checklist:\n- Lead-time inference used (confirmed L=0) so order will be available for this period's demand.\n- Reconciled inventory: no in-transit; order 60 will arrive this period.\n- Adjusted OR recommendation downward slightly (OR=73 \u2192 my order=60) based on recent lower mean demand and desire to limit holding cost since profit and holding cost are equal.\n- No new sustained regime change or other long-term insight (only transient variability), so no carry-over insight is recorded.\n",

The OR baseline computed 85 units using the promised lead time and its cap. Given profit = holding cost, the OR\u2019s critical fractile is 0.5 (no bias toward overstocking); its capping rule smooths orders. Adjustment decision: because lead time = 0, we can react to immediate demand, so we don't need extra multi-period pipeline cover. However, recent observed demand (Period 26 demand = 114) is higher than OR\u2019s 85 recommendation and we currently have zero on-hand. To reduce immediate stockout risk while avoiding excessive holding cost (profit = holding), I increase OR\u2019s recommendation modestly to 100 units.

In-transit = 0 and with lead_time=0 any order we place this decision phase will arrive during this period (and be available to meet period demand). Step 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand summary: On-hand = 41. Historical sample set provided (118,130,72,58,121) gives an empirical mean = 99.8 units/period; using the most recent 5-period demands in the log (Period_28\u201332: 117,61,133,84,62) gives a recent mean \u2248 91.4. OR's capped recommendation is 45 units, which appears low relative to typical single-period demand (~92\u2013100). Step 3 \u2014 Cost tradeoff and OR baseline: Profit = $1 and Holding = $1 so the critical fractile is 0.5 (no bias to over- or under-stock). OR's policy is conservative due to its cap; it ignores the current visible on-hand and lead-time certainty. Step 4 \u2014 Final decision logic: With lead_time=0 we can top up immediately. I target about one period's expected demand (using the longer-run sample mean \u2248100) on hand to avoid stockouts while respecting equal holding/profit cost (neutral risk). To bring available inventory to \u2248100, order = 100 \u2212 on-hand = 100 \u2212 41 = 59 units. This increases availability vs OR's 45 but remains moderate given holding cost parity. Step 5 \u2014 Risks & mitigation: If demand is lower (recent mean ~91), we may hold an extra ~9\u201318 units (acceptable given equal holding/profit).

Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period and can be used to satisfy current-period demand.\n- Demand outlook: Historical demand is variable but typical single-period demand in history clusters around ~80\u2013110 in many periods; OR computed a capped base-stock order of 51 using its empirical method (which already accounts for mean demand over (1+L) periods and the 95%-cap). With profit = holding, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0), so OR's approach targets the empirical mean over the review+lead horizon; OR's cap smooths the order size.\n- Reconciliation with OR recommendation: OR recommends ordering 51 units. With on-hand 34 + order 51 \u2192 available inventory \u2248 85 for the (current) demand. Given observed demand patterns (many periods near 80\u2013100) and equal profit/holding costs (no bias toward heavy overstock or stockout), the OR quantity is a reasonable balanced choice. Also, lead time = 0 means no pipeline uncertainty to justify increasing order beyond OR's capped recommendation. Increasing would raise holding cost with no clear demand spike signal; decreasing risks stockouts in periods where demand returns to its historical mean.\nFinal decision and justification:\n- Action: place order of 51 units for chips(Regular).\n- Rationale: Follow OR's capped base-stock recommendation because (a) confirmed lead time 0 means the order will immediately cover current demand, (b) OR already applied a cap to avoid overreacting to low pipeline, and (c) there is no strong, sustained signal (per the carry-over rule) of a change in demand regime or lost shipments that would justify deviating. This choice balances expected profit from additional sales against equivalent holding cost risk.\n- Risk notes: If we observe several forthcoming periods with systematically lower demand (3+ periods), we should reduce future orders; conversely, if we see a sustained spike (3+ periods), we should raise the base-stock target.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201336) repeatedly shows orders arriving same period (arrived=ordered each period). Carry-over insight already records lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 4). Therefore promised lead time = actual lead time = 0: an order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and be available to meet this period's demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory posture: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0 we can meet current-period demand by ordering now; we do not need pipeline coverage beyond the current period (L+1 = 1 period coverage required).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment vs OR recommendation: OR recommends 85 units (its baseline uses long-run historical stats). I computed a short-term demand estimate using the most recent five observed demands (Periods 32\u201336): {62, 58, 93, 52, 94} \u2192 mean = 71.8 units. This recent window captures the latest regime which appears lower and more variable than the early-period spikes. Given we only need to cover one period and holding cost equals profit ($1 = $1), leftover inventory hurts reward as much as each sold unit helps it. So we should target expected sales for the coming period rather than pad extra safety stock.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision: Reduce OR's recommendation of 85 down to 72 units (rounding the recent mean 71.8 \u2192 72). Rationale: with lead time = 0 we can order to match expected current-period demand and avoid creating ending inventory that incurs holding cost equal to profit. Ordering 72 units balances the goal of capturing expected demand while minimizing the risk of costly overstock.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk notes & follow-up: If demand in the next 2\u20133 periods shows a sustained shift upward again (average above ~90) I will increase orders; conversely if demand falls further I'll cut more.

There are no in-transit units and on-hand = 10, so any order placed this period will arrive in time for this period's demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: OR's recommendation (74) is based on the long-run sample mean (\u224899.8 from the five initial samples) and the capped base-stock calculation. However recent realized demand has been lower than that early sample mean. Looking at the most recent five demand observations (Periods 33\u201337 = 58, 93, 52, 94, 62) the average demand \u2248 71.8 units. Across many periods demand is volatile, but there is no strong evidence of an imminent spike; recent periods suggest a lower central tendency than OR's historical sample-based mean.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Cost trade-offs: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1, so the critical fractile is 0.5 (symmetric cost). This implies ordering to meet the best point estimate of expected demand (little or no safety stock) is appropriate. Given equal profit and holding costs, over-ordering penalizes ending inventory as much as stockouts forego profit.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Order decision: Target next-period demand \u2248 72 units (recent mean). Subtract on-hand 10 to arrive at order = 62 units. This is slightly below OR's 74, reflecting the lower recent realized demand and aiming to avoid unnecessary holding cost while still meeting expected sales. With lead time = 0 the order will be available for Period 38 demand, so no pipeline buffer is needed.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Monitoring: Continue to watch realized demand over the next 3+ periods; if low-demand regime persists (3+ periods of consistent lower average) record a carry-over insight and reduce targets further.

With equal profit and holding, safety stock is not justified; aim to supply expected single-period demand rather than build inventory.\n- OR recommendation: OR suggests 86 units. Given confirmed lead time = 0, zero on-hand, zero pipeline, and recent average demand \u224885, OR's recommendation aligns with the current demand environment and appropriate risk posture (no extra safety stock because holding cost equals profit).\nDecision and execution plan:\n- Follow OR recommendation and order 86 units. This fills current-period demand exposure promptly (arrives during Period 40) without creating unnecessary holding cost. If upcoming periods show a sustained change in mean demand (3+ periods of consistent deviation), I will record a new carry-over insight and adjust orders accordingly.\n- No new carry-over insight is recorded now because the lead time confirmation was already logged and recent demand volatility does not yet constitute a sustained regime change (needs 3+ consistent periods).",

These recent periods are more representative of current regime than the initial 5-sample training set.\n- Cost structure: Profit = $1/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile = 0.5, so the optimal order target is the expected demand (no extra safety stock). Given holding cost equals profit, excess inventory directly reduces reward, so we should aim to match expected demand closely.\nDecision logic and final qty:\n- Because lead time = 0, ordering now immediately covers this period's demand. With on-hand=0, I should order to meet expected demand for this period.\n- I prefer recent realized mean (\u224895.4) over OR's 86, because recent 5-periods show sustained demand around mid-90s and OR's cap/long-run smoothing appears to understate current demand.\n- To balance integer quantity and the holding-cost sensitivity, I round to 95 units (close to recent mean) to maximize units_sold while avoiding needless ending inventory.\nTherefore I order 95 units for chips(Regular).

With lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive in Period 42 before demand is realized, so we can satisfy Period 42 demand with a same-period order.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. There is no inventory buffer; we must order to meet expected Period 42 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: The OR recommendation (87) is computed from long-run historical stats and the promised lead time. However recent demand has been higher than that recommendation. Looking at the most recent five demands (Periods 37\u201341): 62, 105, 112, 104, 129 \u2014 average = 102.4 units. This recent window shows a sustained higher realized demand regime compared to OR's lower recommendation.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk/ cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1, giving a critical fractile q = 0.5 and z* = 0. Under that loss symmetry, the statistical optimum is to order the expected demand (no extra safety stock). Because lead time = 0, there's no need to cover multiple periods of uncertainty in the pipeline.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision: I increase the OR baseline from 87 to 103 units to match the recent observed mean demand (rounded from 102.4 to 103). This supplies expected Period 42 demand given on-hand=0 and avoids unnecessary stockouts in the face of elevated recent demand while respecting the cost symmetry (we're ordering the expected demand, not adding large safety stock). If we observe subsequent periods with demand falling back below OR's baseline, I'll revert; for now the recent five-period mean justifies the increase.\n\nHow this adapts OR: I used OR's structure as a starting point but overrode the capped recommendation because real-time evidence (consistent lead_time=0 and a clear upward shift in recent realized demand over the last 5 periods) implies ordering closer to the recent mean is superior to OR's lower long-run suggestion.",

Therefore orders placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 43 demand. Inventory/pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all expected sales this period must be supplied by the order placed now. Demand assessment: OR used only the original five-sample historical set (118,130,72,58,121) to produce a capped base-stock recommendation of 88. Recent realized demand has been higher than that sample mean: the last five realized demands (Periods 38\u201342) are 105, 112, 104, 129, 129 with an average \u2248 116 units. Given no lead-time uncertainty and that arrivals are same-period, the most relevant forecast is the recent realized demand average rather than the stale initial sample set. Profit vs. holding: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1, so leftover inventory next period effectively cancels profit on unsold units; this argues for ordering close to expected sales (not much safety stock). Decision: Increase OR's capped recommendation (88) to match recent demand evidence. I order 116 units (rounded from the recent 5-period average \u2248115.8) to target expected sales this period while avoiding excess safety stock that would incur holding costs equal to profit. Adjustment rationale vs OR: OR's cap and sample mean understate current demand; with confirmed zero lead time and no pipeline, using recent realized demand is appropriate. Risk management: Because holding cost equals profit I avoided adding extra safety stock beyond expected demand. If demand surprises to the upside repeatedly in subsequent periods, I will raise orders further; if demand falls, I will reduce orders to avoid costly holding. ",

To match expected demand (~110) I should target roughly 110 units available for sale this period.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 56 units (it uses historical samples and promised lead time). OR's cap is conservative and understates current demand given the recent run of ~110 units/period. Following OR would leave available supply = 32 + 56 = 88, likely causing ~22 units of lost sales (foregone profit) relative to demand ~110.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Period 1\u201347) shows repeated same-period arrivals; existing carry-over insight already records lead time confirmed = 0. With lead_time = 0, any order placed now will arrive before demand in Period 48, so we can top up to the single-period demand target.\n\nDemand & OR comparison: OR recommended 76 units (it uses older historical samples and promised lead time). Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, so no safety-stock buffer (z*=0) \u2192 target \u2248 expected single-period demand. Using the most relevant recent data (last 5 realized demands, Periods 43\u201347 = 104, 84, 128, 119, 101), the recent average demand \u2248 107.2 units/period, which better reflects the current regime than OR's lower capped value.\n\nInventory position & action calculation: On-hand = 14, in-transit = 0 (no pipeline). With target \u2248107 units available for Period 48 demand and lead_time = 0 (same-period arrival), order = target \u2212 on-hand \u2248 107 \u2212 14 = 93 units. This raises available inventory to ~107 to meet expected demand; we do not add extra safety stock because q=0.5 (profit equals holding cost) and holding cost is high relative to benefit of overstock.\n\nRisk notes: If demand falls below the recent average, we'll incur holding cost ($1/unit/period) on any leftover stock; if demand spikes above ~107, we'll stockout on the excess. Given sustained recent demands around 100+, ordering to meet the recent mean is justified. OR's cap (76) is too low versus recent realized demand, so I've increased ordering accordingly.\n\nFinal decision: Order 93 units for chips(Regular).",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & pipeline: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4). There is no in-transit inventory. Orders arrive same period they are placed, but we only observe confirmation in the conclude message the following period. Step 2 \u2014 Current inventory position: On-hand = 26, In-transit = 0. Step 3 \u2014 Demand signal: OR recommended 64 units using its capped base-stock method (which uses historical samples and the promised lead time). OR's policy is a reasonable baseline, but it uses a long-history mean and its cap smoothing. Recent realized demand is higher than OR's implicit target: the last 5 periods' demand (Periods 44\u201348) = [84, 128, 119, 101, 81], average \u2248 102.6. Because lead time = 0, we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 = 1). Step 4 \u2014 Target and order calculation: With profit = holding ($1/$1), the critical fractile is 0.5 so the risk-neutral base-stock equals the expected single-period demand. Using recent mean \u2248103 is more responsive to the current regime than OR's long-run smoothing. Target on-hand before demand = target_base_stock \u2248 103. Required order = target \u2212 current on-hand = 103 \u2212 26 = 77. To be slightly conservative against demand variability and rounding and to keep order simple, I place 80 units. Step 5 \u2014 Tradeoffs & objective alignment: The reward equals Profit\xd7units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost\xd7ending_inventory with equal unit profit and holding cost. Ordering to meet expected demand maximizes units sold without excessive ending inventory. Ordering 80 raises beginning-of-period inventory to 106, close to recent realized demand, reducing stockouts and improving profit while limiting holding cost. Step 6 \u2014 OR comparison & adjustments: I increased OR's recommendation from 64 \u2192 80 because recent realized demand (~103) is well above OR's capped suggested top-up (OR\u2019s cap/smoothing underweights recent elevated demand). Given confirmed lead time = 0 and zero pipeline, the increase is justified to better match recent demand patterns and maximize sales.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 64\u219280 units because lead time is confirmed 0, on-hand=26, and recent average demand (Periods 44\u201348) \u2248103 \u2192 need ~77 units to meet one-period demand; 80 is a conservative round-up to reduce stockouts.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201349) repeatedly shows orders arriving in the same period they were ordered. Carry-over already recorded Period 4 confirming lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive before today's demand (lead_time L = 0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate & OR baseline: The OR baseline uses the provided historical samples (118,130,72,58,121). Their mean = 99.8 units/period. With L = 0, the base-stock target = (1+L)*mean = 99.8. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), so the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0; no extra safety stock is required beyond the mean.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 15 units, in-transit = 0. With L = 0 we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand from on-hand after the arrival of any order placed now.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Order calculation & comparison to OR: Target on-hand \u2248 base-stock \u2248 100 units. Required order = target \u2212 on-hand = 100 \u2212 15 = 85 units (using rounded base-stock). OR recommended 75 units (it applied its cap). Given we have confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of an increased demand regime, bringing inventory up to the empirical mean minimizes expected stockouts without building extra holding cost. Therefore I increase OR\u2019s 75 \u2192 85 to reach the mean demand target.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk checks: Demand history shows variability, but the critical-fractile and equal profit/holding cost imply no systematic advantage to overstocking. Lead time is reliably 0 so no pipeline uncertainty. If future periods show sustained mean shifts (3+ periods), I will record a carry-over insight and adjust the base-stock accordingly.\n\nFinal decision: Order 85 units so arriving before today's demand, bringing on-hand to ~100 units to meet expected single-period demand of ~99.8.",
