No evidence of a sustained regime change (only 5 samples, variability present). c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown.

Given profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period, the cost of under-ordering (lost profit per unit sold) is higher than holding cost, so err slightly toward meeting expected demand. Because lead time could be >0 (which would cause stockout if we relied on same-period arrival), we still place an order equal to one period's expected demand to attempt to satisfy Period 1 demand whether or not arrival is same-period. Therefore order 110 units (rounded from 108.8) to balance service level and holding cost.",

The actual observed Period 1 conclude shows demand=114 (sold 110 due to stockout), which is consistent with the historical mean being ~109 and suggests no confirmed sustained regime change (only one high observation). Because a sustained shift requires 3+ periods of evidence, we do not record a regime change yet.\n\nc) Lead time / arrivals: Period 1 conclude explicitly states the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 with lead_time=0. That is direct evidence that actual lead time = 0 periods so far. In-transit = 0 and there are no overdue shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0.

Assume demand is approximately Normal with mean \u2248108.8 and sd \u224835.5 from the historical samples.

This balances expected marginal profit of a sale ($4) against the expected marginal holding cost ($1) and uses the available demand history plus the Period 1 observation. Given no confirmed regime shift and lead_time=0, ordering 139 units provides reasonable service while limiting expected holding cost.",
