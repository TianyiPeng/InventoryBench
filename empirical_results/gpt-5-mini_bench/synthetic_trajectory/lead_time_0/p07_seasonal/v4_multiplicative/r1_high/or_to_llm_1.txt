{
  "rationale": "Situation & constraints: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. OR recommends 191 units based on historical samples (mean demand = 131 units, sample sd \u224836.4), promised lead time L=0, profit=19, holding=1 (critical fractile q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645). OR's base-stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 = 131 + 1.645\xd736.4 \u2248 190.9 \u2192 191, and the OR cap equals the same value here, so order_raw and cap coincide.\nLead-time inference & risk: There are no concluded 'arrived' messages yet (Period 0 conclude not available), so we have no evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised L=0. Because lost/delayed shipments would show as missing concludes in later periods, we cannot assume a delay now. Demand signal: historical demands are moderately volatile (sd \u224836) with one recent low observation (Period_5=69) but not a sustained drop (only one low period). Given high profit relative to holding cost, the optimal fractile is high (95%), so carrying safety stock is justified.\nDecision logic: Follow the OR recommendation. With on-hand + pipeline = 0, ordering 191 brings our inventory position to the OR base-stock level designed to meet (L+1)=1 period demand with a 95% service target. This balances high stockout cost (foregone profit $19/unit) against low holding cost $1/unit/period. Because no concluded arrivals exist to contradict promised L=0 and no sustained demand regime change is observed, deviating from OR would increase stockout risk unnecessarily.\nAction: Order 191 units this period. Monitoring plan / next steps: Watch the 'Period 1 conclude' message next period for any arrived units (which will confirm whether actual lead time is 0 or >0). If arrivals do not conclude as promised over subsequent periods, infer delayed/lost shipment and adjust future orders (increase in-transit accounting or safety stock for longer lead time).",

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step analysis:\n1) Lead-time inference: Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order (191) arrived in Period 1 with stated lead_time = 0. That confirms actual lead time = 0 for the observed order (arrival visible in Period 1 conclude). No evidence of lost shipments.\n\n2) Demand and OR math check: Historical samples give mean \u03bc\u0304 = (150+163+134+139+69)/5 = 131 units/period, sample std \u2248 36.42. With promised L=0, OR computes \u03bc\u0302 = 131, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 36.42. Critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

OR recommended 98 (capped/rounded); cap not binding for L=0 here.\n\n3) Inventory timing (critical): With actual lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive during Period 2 (after decision, before demand), so inventory will be available to satisfy Period 2 demand. Given high profit and low holding cost, keeping service high is appropriate.\n\n4) Decision and justification: I place an order of 105 units (rounding the raw order 104.9 up slightly). This brings physical inventory during Period 2 to 86 + 105 = 191 units, matching the OR base-stock target (~191) and giving the high service level implied by q=0.95. I increased OR's recommendation modestly (98 \u2192 105) to exactly reach the theoretical base-stock level derived from historical demand and the high critical fractile, and because lead time = 0 was confirmed so arrivals will be usable this period. Holding cost is small ($1) vs profit ($19), so the extra units have low penalty relative to stockout risk.\n\n5) Risk considerations: If demand unexpectedly falls (e.g., the low 69 observation), we will incur small holding costs; but given profit margin the policy prioritizes avoiding stockouts. No sustained pattern (3+ periods) of regime change or lead-time drift exists, so no carry-over insight recorded.\n",

Decision & justification: I will follow the OR recommendation of 105 units.

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1) Lead-time inference: Period conclude messages for P1, P2, P3 each state arrived units (ordered on same period) with lead_time=0. That is 3 periods of consistent evidence, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.\n2) Inventory & demand: On-hand = 85, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands (from conclude messages) are 105, 118, 93 \u2192 recent average = 105.3 units/period. With lead_time = 0, any order placed now will arrive before demand in Period 4 and can be used to satisfy Period 4 demand.\n3) OR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 88 units. OR uses historical samples and its capped base-stock; however OR appears to aim for a much larger on-hand position (~85 + 88 = 173) which exceeds recent mean demand (~105) by ~65 units. Given very high profit relative to holding cost (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95) stocking more reduces stockouts, but holding cost ($1/unit) still subtracts from objective when excess inventory is large.\n4) Decision logic: Goal is to maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory. With on-hand 85 and expected demand \u2248105, ordering enough to meet expected demand (\u224820 units) yields expected extra sold units (~20) at $19 profit each = $380, while the holding cost on leftover inventory beyond expected demand is minimized. Ordering OR's 88 would increase expected sales little (demand ~105) but would add substantial ending inventory and holding costs. Because lead time is confirmed 0 and recent demand average is ~105, I will order 20 units to bring on-hand to ~105 to capture expected demand while avoiding excess holding cost.\n5) Final strategy: Order 20 units now (arrives same period) to match expected period demand.

Because L=0, there is no pipeline to wait for; ordered units will immediately augment on-hand before demand in this period.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand estimate from recent history: Using realized demands from Periods 1\u20137 = [105, 118, 93, 105, 94, 128, 57]. Sample mean = 100 units/period, sample std \u2248 22.7 units.

OR recommended 93 units (it uses promised lead time and historical mixes), which would push inventory well above the 95%-service target and create unnecessary holding cost given current demand volatility.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Adjustment decision: I order 64 units to bring expected stock to the base-stock level (~137). This respects the confirmed zero lead time (so the order helps satisfy current-period demand) and uses recent realized demand (mean=100, std\u224822.7) with the high service fractile implied by profit/holding ratio. I do not increase the order for a larger safety cap because there's no evidence of sustained demand surge (Period 7 drop to 57 appears temporary) and holding cost is non-negligible relative to profit.\n\nStep 7 \u2014 Risk notes: If upcoming periods show sustained higher demand (3+ periods of higher-than-average sales), raise base-stock accordingly.

Current visible pipeline = on-hand 89 + in-transit 0. With L=0, any order placed now can arrive same period (and will be visible next conclude).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand evidence: Use recent realized demands (P4\u2013P8) which reflect current regime: [106, 94, 128, 57, 48]. Mean = 86.6 units/period; sample std \u2248 33.6. Recent two periods (57, 48) show a downward shift, but not yet a sustained 3+ period signal, so I weight the 5-period window for stability.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR suggests 78 units (based on its capped base-stock using promised L and its historical samples). Using the same rationale but current observations: with L=0 the target base-stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 where \u03bc\u0302 = 86.6 and z* for profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645.

This brings projected on-hand to ~142 to meet the high service level implied by profit vs. holding cost while avoiding unnecessary holding given recent demand softness. OR's 78 is higher than needed because it likely used a longer/higher historical mean; with current on-hand already near the single-period mean, a smaller order suffices. Also, holding cost is low ($1) but still prefers avoiding large overstock given the last two weak demand periods.\n\nFinal action: order 53 units for chips(Regular).

That implies ordering \u2248 135 \u2212 104 = 31 units. This modest top-up preserves a high service level (per the high critical fractile) while avoiding unnecessary holding cost from following OR's larger suggested order. Because arrivals are same-period, the 31 units will be available for this period's demand.\n\nRisk notes: If demand suddenly spikes back to the higher earlier levels (periods 1\u20133), this order is conservative; but given five recent periods of lower demand and low holding cost relative to profit, topping up to base-stock balances service and cost.",

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & pipeline: Concluded history shows arrivals always in the same period they were ordered (Periods 1\u201310 conclude all show lead_time=0). On-hand = 47, in-transit = 0, so pipeline_inventory = 47. With confirmed L=0, any order placed this period arrives before demand is realized and therefore can be used to satisfy Period 11 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate (focus on recent regime): The most relevant recent demands (Periods 6\u201310) are [128, 57, 48, 38, 88]. Their mean \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 71.8 units/period and sample standard deviation \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 36.9 units. I prefer recent 5-period stats because the earlier five periods include very different values and the OR baseline uses all history equally; here demand appears to have dropped and become more variable, so recency is more informative.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR baseline check: OR recommends 117 units, using promised lead time and full history. OR's recommendation is higher than my recent-demand-driven target; likely because OR's mean (including earlier high values) and its safety factor produce a larger base-stock.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Newsvendor/safety calculation and order quantity: With profit = $19 and holding = $1, critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, z* \u2248 1.645.

Pipeline_inventory = 47, so uncapped order_raw \u2248 132.5 \u2212 47 = 85.5 \u2248 86 units.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Practical adjustment: I round to 86 units. This follows the safety-aware newsvendor-derived base-stock given the high profit:holding ratio, but uses the recent lower mean to avoid overstock and holding costs. Since lead time is 0, the order will immediately bolster inventory for Period 11 demand. The OR's 117 is higher\u2014likely reflecting older high-demand periods\u2014so I reduce it to 86 to match the recent regime while still keeping the 95% fractile safety buffer.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk considerations: If demand reverts upward quickly, we could under-order versus OR; but evidence over the last five periods shows a sustained lower average, so this conservative reduction balances profit from sales and holding cost minimization.\n",

Reasoning: with L=0 the order will arrive before demand; base-stock target (95% fractile) is \u2248148 units which balances the high profit (favoring stock) and holding cost. Ordering ~148 covers expected demand plus safety stock for high-variance demand (P6 and P11 spikes) while avoiding extra holding cost from overshooting OR's larger recommendation. Because lead time is 0, we can quickly adjust next period if demand regime changes again.\n- Risk management: If Period 12 demand turns out much higher (another 140+ spike), we can top up in Period 13 immediately because lead time is 0. Conversely, if demand is low, holding cost is only $1/unit/period, so the chosen quantity is conservative given the high profit per unit.\n",

OR recommendation is 173 units (OR uses promised L and historical demand to target a high service level; with profit=19 and holding=1 the critical fractile q=19/20=0.95, implying a high safety factor). Decision logic: Given high profit relative to holding cost (strong incentive to avoid stockouts) and confirmed 0 lead time (so ordered stock will immediately serve Period 14 demand), I accept the OR recommendation. I do not further increase the order for the single-period P13 spike because it is not yet a sustained regime shift (requirement: 3+ periods). I also avoid reducing the order because demand variance and the high profit/higher stockout cost argue for maintaining OR's high service-level recommendation.

Current inventory: on-hand = 25, in-transit = 0. OR recommendation = 136 units (uses promised L=0 and the original 5-sample demand history with a high safety factor because profit >> holding cost).\n\nDemand analysis: The OR baseline relies on the earlier sample mean (~131) and a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 gives q=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645), hence its large recommendation. However, recent realized demand (Periods 17\u201321 = 109, 61, 80, 94, 96) averages 88 units \u2014 substantially lower than the original sample mean. This lower regime has persisted for 5 periods, so I treat it as a sustained shift.\n\nInventory target and order logic: With L=0 the decision must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. Given the recent average demand \u224888 and OR's upward pressure from safety stock, a reasonable single-period target stock (including safety) is ~100 units to balance stockout risk vs holding cost. With on-hand 25 and no confirmed in-transit, order = target - on-hand = 100 - 25 = 75 units. This reduces OR's 136 to better match observed demand while keeping modest safety margin. Ordering 75 units still leaves some upside to meet occasional higher demand but avoids excessive holding cost from following OR blindly.\n\nFinal strategy: Order 75 units now (arrives same period). Monitor arrivals and demand; if upcoming periods continue to show the lower regime, reduce future targets further; if demand reverts upward for 3+ periods, raise orders toward OR baseline.

Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive in this period and can satisfy today's demand. Demand analysis: Recent confirmed regime (Periods 17\u201321) shows a lower sustained average (~88 units) vs earlier higher demand (~131), but Period 22 shows a single large demand observation of 131 where we were stocked only to 100 (sold=100, lost demand unknown). That single spike is not yet a sustained shift. Given the short history and the rule to be conservative about regime changes, I treat the current expected single-period demand as roughly 95\u2013100 units (midpoint between the 17\u201321 average and the most recent realized sale), rather than the OR's higher base-stock that assumes older higher-demand data. OR recommendation: 162 units (capped base-stock) is driven by a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) which pushes up safety stock. Adjustment reasoning: Holding cost is small relative to profit, so stocking to meet expected demand is preferable, but ordering the full OR recommendation risks excessive ending inventory if the lower regime persists.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive in Period 24 and be available to satisfy Period 24 demand. Inventory state: On-hand=0, In-transit=0 so we have no coverage for current-period demand unless we order now. Demand assessment: Recent concluded demand samples include Period 22 demand=131 and Period 23 demand=116. Note both Periods 22\u201323 sold=100 each due to starting inventory=100, so sales were constrained by stockouts and do not fully reveal true demand; nevertheless these two periods show underlying demand at least 116\u2013131. Earlier history shows many high-demand periods (e.g., 146, 173, 128, 131, 163, etc.), and the OR base-stock method yields a recommendation of 161 units using the promised lead time and full historical samples. Cost trade-offs: Profit per unit is $19 and holding cost is $1 (critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95 \u2192 high service level). With high profit relative to holding cost, overstocking is less costly than stockouts. Decision logic vs OR: OR's recommendation (161) already incorporates a high safety factor consistent with our profit/holding ratio. Given (a) confirmed lead time = 0 so the ordered units will cover Period 24 demand immediately, (b) recent evidence of demand at least 116\u2013131 despite stockouts, and (c) high profit/low holding cost favoring service, I will follow the OR recommendation and order 161 units to prioritize meeting demand and capturing profit. Implementation: order 161 units now; they will arrive during Period 24 and be available for demand that same period. Risk notes: If true demand is much lower (reverting to the lower regime observed in Periods 17\u201321), we will incur holding cost on excess units; however that downside is relatively small ($1 per unit per period) compared to lost profit from stockouts ($19 per unit).",

Therefore any order placed now will arrive during Period 25 before demand is realized.\n- Inventory position: on-hand = 55, in-transit = 0.\n- Recent demand: Periods 20\u201324 demands = [94, 96, 131, 116, 106]; 5-period mean \u2248 108.6 units. This is the best short-term forecast given the recent history and the confirmed 0 lead time.\n- OR recommendation: 106 units (OR uses a capped base-stock with a high critical fractile q\u22480.95). OR aims for high service but does not account for current on-hand explicitly in the same intuitive way I prefer to use when L=0.\nDecision logic and final quantity:\n- With lead time 0 we only need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Expected demand \u2248 109 units; we have 55 on-hand, so ordering ~54 units brings available inventory to \u2248109, matching the expected demand for this period.\n- I choose a conservative, demand-matching order (54 units) rather than the full OR recommendation (106). Rationale: profit is high relative to holding cost, but demand has fluctuated and the recent 5-period mean (~109) is lower than the long-run high values OR may overweight; ordering only what is needed this period avoids unnecessary holding cost and large overstock if demand softens next period. Because lead time = 0, we can adjust orders next period quickly if demand shifts.\n- If demand were to spike immediately above the recent max (~131), we'd risk a stockout; however the OR's aggressive safety stock (ordering 106) would raise holding cost and may be unnecessary given the most recent stabilized average. Given ability to respond within the same period (L=0), it's preferable to order to cover expected demand and react next period if needed.\nCalculation shown explicitly:\n- Expected demand (5-period mean) = (94+96+131+116+106)/5 = 108.6 \u2248 109\n- Order = max(0, expected_demand \u2212 on_hand) = 109 \u2212 55 = 54 (rounded to nearest whole unit)\nTherefore I order 54 units for chips(Regular).",

Promised lead time = 0 is confirmed, so an order placed now will arrive during this same period and can satisfy Period 31 demand. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we have no coverage for Period 31 demand unless we order now. Demand analysis: Recent realized demands (Periods 26\u201330 = 91, 67, 81, 69, 111) average \u2248 83.8 over the last 5 periods; earlier sustained lower-regime evidence (Periods 17\u201321 avg \u2248 88 vs earlier \u2248131) was previously recorded. The most recent five-period sample suggests single-period demand near 84\u201390, with occasional spikes (Period 30 = 111). OR recommendation: OR recommends 154 units using the capped base-stock policy and the full historical demand record with a high critical fractile (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645). That recommendation is conservative because it targets a high service level and uses all history (including higher earlier demands). Adjustment decision: Given confirmed lead time = 0, we only need to cover the current period plus a modest safety buffer. Placing 154 would likely create excessive ending inventory and incur unnecessary holding cost given recent lower demand regime. I therefore scale OR down to 100 units: this covers ~1.2\xd7 the recent 5-period mean (100 \u2248 1.2\xd784), provides headroom for the recent spike (111) while limiting holding cost exposure. Implementation: Order 100 units now \u2014 they will arrive during Period 31 and be available to satisfy Period 31 demand. Monitoring: If we observe sustained demand >100 in the next 3+ periods, escalate orders and record a carry-over insight (regime shift). If demand continues at ~80\u201390, continue ordering around 80\u2013110 depending on inventory at period start. Summary numbers used: recent 5-period mean \u224883.8; OR =154 \u2192 final order =100; q=0.95 (explains OR conservatism); lead time confirmed 0 so no pipeline needs beyond current period. ",

Period 32 (Period_32) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Summary of key facts and inference:\n- Lead time: confirmed 0 periods (carry-over insight and concluded arrivals show same-period arrival repeatedly). Orders placed now will arrive during the current period's arrival resolution and will be available to meet demand this period. There is no in-transit inventory.\n- Inventory position: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. We must supply this period's demand from any order placed now.\n- Demand outlook: recent realized demands (Periods 27\u201331) = [67, 81, 69, 111, 153], recent 5-period average \u2248 96 units with meaningful volatility (one high 153). Earlier history shows occasional spikes >130, but the most recent 5 periods produce an average near 96. The OR baseline (157) uses a longer historical average and the promised lead time; it seeks a high service level because profit >> holding cost.\n- Cost tradeoffs: Profit = $19/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95 (z* \u2248 1.645). High profit relative to holding cost justifies protecting against stockouts, but holding cost is not zero so excessive overstock reduces total reward.\n\nHow I compared to OR and decided:\n1. OR recommends 157 units. That recommendation assumes the OR's demand estimate and promised lead time; it tends to drive a high base-stock because q is high. OR's cap smooths swings but still suggests a large order.\n2. Given lead time = 0 and that orders arrive same period, we can safely order only what we expect to sell this period (plus a modest safety buffer) without needing to cover multi-period pipeline. That reduces the need to carry large ending inventory.\n3. Recent 5-period mean \u2248 96 is a better short-term anchor than OR's long-run estimate because demand has been volatile and recent periods include a spike; I want to be conservative about inventory holding while still protecting service. A one-period safety buffer to cover variability (and the high critical fractile) argues for ordering above ~96, but not as high as 157 which would create more holding cost risk.\n\nFinal numeric decision and justification:\n- Order 130 units. Rationale: 130 covers the recent mean (~96) plus ~35 units of safety to mitigate variability and the high cost of stockouts (profit-driven). With lead time = 0, these units arrive immediately and will be used this period. Ordering 130 trades off service (likely avoid stockouts on most realizations including moderate spikes) against holding cost; it reduces expected holding relative to OR's 157 while still providing a strong service level given profit/holding ratio.\n\nOperational notes for next periods:\n- Monitor arrivals and sales this period to confirm demand regime. If we see several consecutive periods of sustained higher demand (>130 average over 3+ periods), increase order size toward OR levels. If demand falls, scale back to avoid holding cost.\n",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 157 \u2192 130 units: lead time is confirmed 0 so we only need to cover this period's demand; recent 5-period average demand \u224896 with volatility, so 130 gives a ~35-unit safety buffer to reduce stockout risk while lowering holding cost vs. OR.",

Historical longer-run variability is substantial but last several periods show occasional spikes (up to 153). The earlier carry-over note about a lower regime (Periods 17\u201321 avg=88) was recorded earlier, but more recent periods show demand has risen again.\n4) OR recommendation: OR baseline (capped base-stock) recommends ordering 156 units. OR uses promised lead time (0) and full history; it applies a high service level because profit is large compared to holding cost.\n5) Decision logic: Profit per unit ($19) is much larger than holding cost per period ($1), producing a high critical fractile (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95) and justifying a substantial safety stock to avoid lost sales. Given: (a) confirmed lead time 0 so the order will be available this period, (b) current on-hand is essentially zero, (c) recent demand average ~108 with large upside risk (observed 153), and (d) low holding cost relative to profit \u2014 I will accept OR's recommendation.

There is no in-transit pipeline to consider.\n2) Inventory position: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so we must cover current-period demand entirely with this order if we want to avoid stockouts this period.\n3) Demand outlook: Recent demand is noisy but trending around ~80\u201390 in many recent periods (Periods 35\u201338: 84, 52, 59, 85) with occasional spikes (Period 39 observed demand 132, where we experienced a stockout because we only had 83 on-hand). This shows we must guard against intermittent large draws.\n4) OR recommendation and math context: OR recommends 153 units. Given profit = $19 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645, which drives a relatively large safety stock. Holding cost is small relative to forgone profit, so overstocking a bit to avoid lost sales is appropriate.\n5) Decision trade-offs: With lead time = 0, ordering 153 arrives this period and prevents the immediate stockout risk seen in Period 39 (demand spike to 132). The holding cost of extra units is low ($1/unit/period) compared with the high profit per unit, so following the OR cap-based recommendation is reasonable.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (multiple period-concludes show orders arriving same period). There are no in-transit units and no evidence of lost shipments.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 77, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, orders placed now arrive during this same period's arrival resolution (and will be visible in the conclude message at period end), so today's order will augment inventory before demand is realized for Period 45.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized demand has been elevated vs earlier stretches. Looking at the last five demand observations (Periods 40\u201344: 87, 146, 143, 139, 80) the recent average \u2248 111 units. Historical longer-run mean (earlier small sample provided: mean \u2248131) shows variability, but the most actionable signal is the recent 5-period average near 111. Demand remains volatile (several >140 spikes), so we need safety stock to avoid lost sales.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends ordering 79 units. With on-hand 77, ordering 79 yields available inventory \u2248156 for this period, which covers the recent average demand (~111) plus a sizable safety margin that protects against the observed spikes (e.g., 140+). Given profit = $19 and holding cost = $1, the critical fractile is high (\u22480.95) and the cost of carrying extra units this period is modest relative to lost-margin risk from stockouts.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision & justification: I accept the OR recommendation of 79 units. Rationale: lead time = 0 so the order arrives for today's demand; current on-hand (77) + OR order (79) = 156 which comfortably covers recent high-demand realizations and limits lost sales in this late-stage horizon (Period 45 of 50). The holding cost is low relative to profit, so erring toward a bit more inventory is appropriate given observed demand volatility and recent >140 spikes.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk trade-offs: Ordering 79 may produce some holding cost if demand is low, but expected profit preserved from avoiding stockouts on spike days outweighs the holding cost. No new lead-time or regime-shift insights meet the threshold for carry-over recording.\n",

With L=0 we must cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period) from on-hand + this order. Recent realized demand (Periods 41\u201345) = [146, 143, 139, 80, 107], 5-period average \u2248 123 units. Using recent data is appropriate because demand has shown variability but no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded change at Period 22. \n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR suggests ordering 106 units. That would raise available inventory to 155, well above the recent single-period mean (123) and likely produce extra ending inventory over the remaining short horizon (we are at Period 46/50). Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit per sold unit is $19\u2014holding is relatively small, but with only 5 periods left excess inventory will incur multiple holding-cost periods without corresponding future demand certainty. \n\nFinal strategy and calculation: Aim to cover expected single-period demand (~123) rather than replenish to OR's larger cap. Required order = target demand (123) \u2212 on-hand (49) \u2212 in-transit (0) = 74 units.
