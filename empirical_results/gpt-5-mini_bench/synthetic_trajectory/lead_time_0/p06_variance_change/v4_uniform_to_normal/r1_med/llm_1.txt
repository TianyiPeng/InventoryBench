With no evidence of a regime shift and only five samples, use the most relevant recent period demand as the forecast for this period. c) Lead time & lost orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0 periods. No concluded arrivals or prior-period conclude messages are available to contradict that promise, so assume same-period arrival is possible (but keep in mind this may be falsified in later concludes). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. If orders arrive same-period (promised 0), placing an order now can satisfy Period_1 demand; if the supplier actually has >0 lead time, this order will arrive too late and sales will be lost\u2014no concluded evidence exists to indicate delays yet. e) Final order logic: To maximize profit (Profit = $4/unit sold) while avoiding unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period), place an order equal to the expected demand for Period_1 (112 units).

Excluding the clear single low outlier in Period 5 (66), the high-demand regime appears around 135\u2013145 (avg \u2248 141). Earlier periods (P1\u2013P2) were ~109\u2013112, but the last three high observations (P3,P4,P6) suggest the current demand regime is the higher level. However, the dip in P5 is isolated and not a sustained shift, so I will not permanently change regime assumptions. c) Lead time & missing orders: Concluded history shows lead time confirmed as 0 periods (arrivals occurred same period ordered). No in-transit units and no lost shipments observed. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With lead time=0, orders placed now will arrive in time for this period's demand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period; profit per unit sold is $4. Given profit >> holding cost, understocking is more costly than modest overstock for one period. e) Final order logic: Target supply for this period should cover expected demand under the higher regime. Using a conservative forecast near the recent high-demand average (~141) but rounding slightly for prudence, I order 140 units to meet expected demand while keeping holding cost exposure moderate.

Objective is to maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1/period, so over-ordering is costly relative to marginal profit; prefer meeting expected demand closely and minimizing ending inventory. e) Order calculation: target forecast demand \u2248 124 units.

No calendar events provided, so rely on historical demand.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Historical realized demand (Periods 1\u201313) shows volatility but a stable long-run mean ~112.5 units/period (sum=1463 over 13 periods => 112.5). Recent 5-period demand (P9\u2013P13 = 118, 65, 146, 79, 119) averages ~105.4, indicating short-run noise but no sustained regime shift. Demand variance is high (periods with 60s and 140s), so forecasts should allow some upside.\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Period 4 concluded lead time confirmed as 0 (arrival same period) and subsequent conclude messages (Periods 5\u201313) consistently show orders arriving the same period. No evidence of lost shipments or increased lead time. Use lead_time = 0 for ordering decisions.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With lead_time = 0, any order placed this period will arrive within this period prior to demand, so we can cover this period's demand with a same-period order. Holding cost = $1/unit/period; profit = $4/unit. Because holding cost is material but lower than lost margin (stockout loses $4 profit), ordering to meet expected demand with a small buffer is appropriate given demand volatility.\n\ne) Final order logic: Balance service level vs. holding cost by targeting long-run mean demand while being conservative versus recent dip. Long-run mean ~112.5; recent shorter-window mean ~105. To avoid frequent stockouts in high-demand spikes (which lose $4 each), I place an order near the long-term mean. With L=0 the order will be available for Period 14 demand and any leftover will incur $1/unit holding cost this period. Therefore I order 112 units for Period 14.",
