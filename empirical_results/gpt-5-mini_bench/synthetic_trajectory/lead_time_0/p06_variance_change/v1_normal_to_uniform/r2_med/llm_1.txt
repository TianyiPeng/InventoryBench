The 5-period average = 98.2 units; there is some variability (low of 60, highs ~121) but no clear sustained shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time. Because no 'Period X conclude' messages are available, we cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because actual lead time is unknown, an order placed now might arrive same period (if actual LT=0) or later (if actual LT>=1). e) Final order logic: To balance service (capture demand and profit = $4/unit) versus holding cost ($1/unit/period), use the historical mean demand (98 units). This quantity targets expected sales without heavy overstock given holding cost equals 25% of unit profit. With no confirmed lead-time delay evidence, ordering the mean is a reasonable risk-balanced choice for Period_1.",

Recent data show moderate variability but no sustained shift. Empirical distribution from the 5-sample history gives an 80% quantile \u2248 122 units. A simple average of the two most recent observed periods (121 and 87) is \u2248104; combining the longer sample supports a target near 120+ for a high service level.\n\nc) Lead time / orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 and both concluded messages show orders placed in Period1 and Period2 arrived in the same period (lead_time was 0 periods).

Recent 3-period avg (P25\u2013P27) = 81.3, but this is heavily skewed by the P25 spike.

Recent periods 40\u201341 show two low observations (75, 8) after the spike, but this is only 2 periods \u2014 not enough to declare a sustained regime change. c) Lead time / pipeline: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period they are placed). In-transit=0, so any new order will arrive during Period 42 and be available for demand in Period 42. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=157 units. Using the working forecast (~165 units) we expect roughly one-period demand near 165. Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit is $4/unit; holding is expensive relative to profit, so we should avoid building multi-period inventory. e) Final order logic: With lead time=0, target on-hand to roughly one-period forecast to meet near-term demand while minimizing holding cost. Target \u2248165 units. Current on-hand 157 \u2192 order 8 units to arrive this period.

However the last three realized demands (Periods 40\u201342 = 75, 8, 19) are much lower but not sustained long enough (>=3 periods of a new pattern) to declare a regime change.

There are no in-transit or overdue orders. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 146, In-transit = 0.

No calendar cues provided.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Recent sustained high-demand regime established starting Period 36 (carry-over): Periods 36\u201339 avg \u2248168.5 and carry-over guidance sets working forecast \u2248165\u2013170 units/period. Historical recent demands: P37=111, P38=179, P39=197, P40=75, P41=8, P42=19, P43 demand was 192 but sold=168 due to stockout (starting on-hand 168 -> sold 168). The P43 outcome indicates true demand at least 192 and that prior inventory constrained sales; this reinforces the higher-demand regime despite volatility.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). In-transit = 0 and no overdue shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With lead_time=0, orders placed this period will arrive in time for current-period demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: Because lead time is 0 we can refresh inventory each period; order should primarily cover one-period expected demand. Given the confirmed higher-demand regime (working forecast \u2248165\u2013170) and evidence of unmet demand at ~192 in Period 43, I place an order near the working forecast to satisfy expected sales while avoiding excessive holding. Holding cost is lower than marginal profit, so stocking to expected demand is appropriate. Therefore order 170 units (within the 165\u2013170 working forecast).",
