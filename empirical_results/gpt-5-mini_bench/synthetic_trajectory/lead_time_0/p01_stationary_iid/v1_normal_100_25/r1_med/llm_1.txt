No evidence of a sustained shift (only normal variance). c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0, but no concluded arrivals exist yet so actual lead time is unknown. Per instructions, do not assume 0; be conservative and plan for an actual lead time of 1 period (so cover L+1 = 2 periods of demand). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. To cover current period demand (occurs after decision) plus one additional period in case actual lead time \u22651, target coverage = 2 \xd7 expected period demand \u2248 2 \xd7 90 = 180 units. e) Final order logic: Order 180 units now. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given uncertain lead time) against holding cost. If lead time turns out to be 0, we'll hold extra inventory for one period (holding cost $1/unit/period) but avoid lost sales; if lead time is \u22651, this order provides coverage for current and next period demand.",

The provided historical sample series (Period_1..5) centers near ~90\u2013110, but system-demonstrated demand is stronger (108 and 124). With partial stockout in Period_2, true demand for P2 was at least 124.

We have two periods of evidence supporting lead_time=0, so it is reasonable to assume 0 lead time for this decision (orders this period will arrive before demand). d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand =0, in-transit =0, so all demand must be supplied by any order we place now (assuming lead_time=0). e) Ordering logic: Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1/period.

Therefore maintain the current baseline demand assumption of ~104 units for next period.\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201326) consistently show ordered shipments arriving in the same period (arrived = ordered on same Period, lead_time=0). Earlier carry-over insight confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (Period 4 evidence). There are currently In-transit = 0 and no overdue shipments. Treat lead time as 0.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 30, In-transit = 0. With lead_time=0, orders placed this decision phase will arrive before demand is realized in this period. Expected demand = ~104 units. To avoid lost sales, need to supply ~104 units this period. Conservative calculation: required order = max(0, expected_demand - on_hand) = 104 - 30 = 74 units. Given demand volatility (possibility of actual demand up near 125) and holding cost trade-off (Profit $4/unit vs Holding $1/unit/period), keep a small safety buffer but avoid heavy overstock. A safety buffer of ~6 units balances service and holding cost.\n\ne) Final order logic: Order 75 units (rounding the computed 74 up slightly) to bring available stock to ~105 units this period, which should satisfy expected demand and keep a modest safety buffer against upside variance. This leverages confirmed 0 lead time so the order will arrive before demand is realized. Monitor demand next periods; if we observe 3+ periods of sustained change, record a new carry-over insight and adjust ordering policy.",

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 17, in-transit = 0, so current immediately-available stock is 17; no shipments pending. Lead-time vs. missing orders: no evidence of lost or delayed shipments; continued 0 lead time. Order logic: because profit per unit = $4 and holding cost = $1 per unit per period, overstock is penalized but understock loses $4 per unit of unsatisfied demand.
