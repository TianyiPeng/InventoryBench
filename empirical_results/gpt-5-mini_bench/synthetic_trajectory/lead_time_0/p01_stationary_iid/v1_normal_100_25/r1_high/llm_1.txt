Sample mean \u2248 89.8, sample min=69, max=111. c) Lead time / missing orders: supplier promised lead time = 0, but there is no concluded arrival history yet (no Period conclude messages). Therefore actual lead time is uncertain. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. There is no safety stock. e) Final order logic: With no on-hand stock and high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1/period), the cost of understocking (lost $19 margin per unit) is far greater than the cost of modest overstock (holding $1 per unit for a period). Using the historical demand mean \u224890 and given a high critical ratio = profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95 (favoring stocking to avoid stockouts), I order slightly above the mean to cover likely demand this period. I choose 100 units (near historical central-high values and below the observed max of 111) to balance service level vs holding cost while acknowledging lead-time uncertainty.",

Game history: Period 1 conclude shows demand=108 but sold=100 due to stockout, so true Period 1 demand exceeded supply. Period 2 sample in historical list is 69, so recent periods vary (69\u2013111). c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 ordered=100 arrived=100 with lead_time=0 (ordered on Period 1, arrived same period). This indicates orders placed now will arrive during the same period and can satisfy Period 2 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No confirmed overdue or lost shipments. e) Ordering logic: Profit per unit is $19 while holding cost is $1/period \u2014 high reward relative to holding cost. Given large lost sales cost (lost profit opportunity) and uncertainty (demand has ranged 69\u2013111 and we observed an unmet demand in P1), it is better to avoid stockouts. With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive before demand this period. I therefore order enough to cover a high-end demand scenario. I choose to order 100 units (matches prior order size that nearly covered observed high demand), which balances service (avoid lost sales) and modest holding cost risk.",

Demand analysis: Concluded history shows two periods where our on-hand constrained sales hit 100 units each (Period 1: demand observed 108 but sold 100; Period 2: demand observed 124 but sold 100). The separate supplied historical sample series (Periods 1-5 = 100,69,92,77,111) implies an average ~90, but recent actual unconstrained demand signals (108 and 124) are higher and indicate the true demand can exceed 100. Lead time and pipeline: Concluded messages from Period 1 and Period 2 show orders arrived with lead_time = 0 (orders placed in Period N arrived in Period N). This is consistent across two periods but not yet a 3+ period sustained confirmation per instructions. Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 0; any order placed now may arrive same period (promised 0 and observed 0 so far), but arrivals will only be visible in the conclude message next period. Decision logic & tradeoffs: Profit per sold unit is high ($19) while holding cost is low ($1/unit/period). The cost of under-ordering (lost high-profit sales) is much larger than modest holding cost. Given recent realized demand >=108 and 124 and the relatively low holding penalty, bias toward stocking enough to meet a higher-demand outcome. I choose to order to cover a high-but-plausible demand for this period (target ~120\u2013130 units) to avoid stockouts while accepting small expected holding cost.",

Recent realized demand (Periods 10\u201314 = 115, 89, 102, 73, 63) has trended down with a 5-period average of 88.4 units. The most recent three periods (12\u201314 = 102, 73, 63) average 79.3, suggesting current demand is nearer ~80\u201390 units rather than the earlier high-120s.\n\nc) Lead time / pipeline: Carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period).
