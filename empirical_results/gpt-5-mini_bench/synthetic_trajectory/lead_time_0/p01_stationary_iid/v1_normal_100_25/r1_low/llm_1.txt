Last 5 periods' demand: P39=93, P40=91, P41=64, P42=65, P43=62 => 5-period average = 75 units. Demand has been trending lower in the most recent 5 periods versus the earlier elevated regime. c) Lead time & orders: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive the same period). In-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 23. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 44 demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit = $1/unit; carrying extra inventory into the next period is costly and should be avoided. e) Final order logic: Target on-hand after arrivals \u2248 expected period demand (75 units) to minimize lost sales while avoiding costly carryover. Required order = max(0, forecast_demand - on_hand) = 75 - 23 = 52 units. This balances service (meet expected demand) against holding cost given profit = holding cost. If demand surprises upward, lost sales cost equals missed profit; given equal profit/holding, this conservative forecast-order is appropriate.",

Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit/unit, so excess inventory at period end completely erodes unit profit if unsold. e) Final order logic: because arrivals are same-period, order should aim to meet expected demand while avoiding excess inventory due to high holding cost.

Orders placed this period will arrive in time to satisfy Period 47 demand. d) Inventory objective: Profit per sold unit = $1 and holding cost per end-unit = $1.
