That confirms at least one observed same-period lead time; no evidence of longer or lost shipments. Per instructions, only concluded messages can be used to infer lead time \u2014 this one confirms actual lead time = 0 for that observation.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Demand history (samples provided) has mean \u2248 106.4 units/period (88,133,93,108,110 \u2192 mean 106.4). Period 1 observed demand was 111 (sold 107 due to stock) which is slightly above the five-period mean. With profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 safety factor z* = 0, so the OR base-stock target equals the expected demand over (1+L) periods. With promised and observed lead time = 0, the OR computed base-stock/cap yields a recommendation of 108, which is consistent with the empirical mean and the capped policy.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Decision rationale vs OR: Because (a) actual lead time observation aligns with the promised 0 (so OR's lead-time assumption is valid), (b) inventory is zero and no pipeline exists, and (c) recent demand is stable around ~106\u2013111, the OR recommendation of 108 is reasonable to meet expected single-period demand while not over-stocking (profit = holding encourages neutral service/holding tradeoff). Therefore I will follow the OR recommendation and order 108 units. This order will arrive during Period 2 (lead_time = 0) and be available to satisfy Period 2 demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk notes: If we see multiple future concludes showing late or missing arrivals, we'll revise for lost shipments or longer lead times.

{
  "rationale": "Situation summary and lead-time inference:\n- Concluded history shows two confirmed same-period arrivals: Period 1 order arrived in Period 1 (lead_time=0) and Period 2 order arrived in Period 2 (lead_time=0). Therefore current best estimate is that actual lead time equals the promised 0 periods (but this is based on only 2 observations).\n\nInventory & demand evidence:\n- On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Any order placed now will arrive during Period 3 and be available to meet Period 3 demand (because lead_time=0 behavior observed).\n- Realized demand (from conclude messages) was 111 in Period 1 and 126 in Period 2. The historical sample set included earlier values (88,133,93,108,110) with a 5-period mean \u2248106.4; OR's recommendation (110) is slightly above that long-run mean.\n- Recent two-period realized demand is trending above the long-run mean (111 and 126), indicating a short-run uptick. However this is only two periods of evidence\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift.\n\nOR recommendation assessment:\n- OR recommends 110 units based on its capped base-stock logic. Given profit=holding cost (critical fractile = 0.5), OR centers on the mean demand; its cap and smoothing may reduce volatility.\n- OR cannot see recent concluded demands beyond historical samples influence, and it does not adapt for the recent uptick observed in the last two periods.\n\nDecision logic and final quantity:\n- Because actual lead time appears to be 0, the order placed now will protect Period 3 demand directly. We should target an order that covers expected Period 3 demand, balancing the observed recent high demand against equal profit/holding costs which penalize overstock equally to understock misses.\n- I increase the order modestly above OR's 110 to reflect the recent spike to 126 in Period 2 while avoiding large overstock risk. A conservative but responsive choice is 125 units \u2014 this matches near the higher recent demand and gives a small buffer for variability.\n\nRisk trade-offs:\n- Ordering 125 risks leftover inventory if demand falls back to the long-run mean (~106); holding cost =$1/unit/period equals profit, so each unsold unit this period would roughly negate profit from a sold unit next period. However, given two consecutive high-demand periods and no pipeline, ordering slightly above OR is warranted to capture sales this period.\n\nAction summary:\n- Place order = 125 units for chips(Regular). This arrives during Period 3 and will be available to meet Period 3 demand.\n\nNotes on carry-over signals:\n- We observed consistent lead_time=0 in two periods, but per the carry-over rule we require >=3 periods of consistent evidence to record a sustained pattern, so we do not record a carry-over insight yet.",

That is consistent evidence (3 periods) that actual lead time = 0 periods.\n- Inventory position: On-hand = 35, in-transit = 0, so current pipeline + on-hand = 35. To reach base_stock \u2248106.4 requires ~71.4 units; OR rounded/capped to 73.\n- Demand outlook: Recent realized demands (conclude messages) were 111, 126, and 90. The sample mean (106.4) aligns with these values and shows no sustained upward or downward regime shift. No calendar/seasonal signals provided.\n- Risk trade-offs: Profit and holding cost are equal, so critical fractile = 0.5 implies no extra safety stock beyond the mean. Given confirmed L=0, ordering to bring inventory up to the mean minimizes expected lost sales without incurring extra holding penalty.\nDecision and justification:\n- I will follow the OR recommendation and order 73 units. This brings on-hand + arrival (35 + 73 = 108) close to the estimated single-period demand mean (~106), matching the base-stock logic. With lead time confirmed as 0, the order will arrive in-period and be available to meet Period 4 demand, and no additional safety stock is justified because profit = holding cost (q=0.5).\n- I limit divergence from OR because OR already encodes the correct critical fractile and used the historical mean; observed reality (lead time and demand) supports its assumptions. No lost shipments or regime shifts warrant an override.\n",

Promised lead time = 0 is confirmed in past data, so any order placed now will arrive during the current period's arrival resolution and be available to meet Period 7 demand (and will be reported in the Period 7 conclude message read next period).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 16, in-transit = 0. Historical realized demands (Periods 1\u20136) are: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91 (avg \u2248 104.5).

Driven by these numbers and the parity of profit and holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR baseline centers orders on the mean demand (no extra safety stock). Holding costs equal profit so we should avoid excess inventory while meeting expected demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to OR recommendation and decide: OR recommends 90 units. With on-hand 16, ordering 90 yields starting-available inventory during the demand phase of ~106 units (16 + 90) which aligns with the long-run mean demand (~104\u2013106). Given lead time is confirmed 0 and there is no evidence of lost shipments or a persistent regime shift (no 3+ period trend away from historical mean), OR's capped recommendation is appropriate.

The previously recorded carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods, so we treat orders as same-period arrivals.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and be available for demand in this period.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand analysis: Use the observed demands from Periods 1\u20137: [111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123]. Sum = 750, mean = 107.14. Variability exists (low/high swings), but the recent sample mean aligns closely with the OR baseline.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Evaluate OR recommendation: OR recommends 107 units. OR's method (with profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 \u2192 z*=0) effectively centers on mean demand over the review+lead window. Given L=0, the OR base stock equals the single-period mean; our empirical mean \u2248107.1, so OR's 107 is appropriate.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision trade-offs: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1. This makes overstocking costly (equal to profit), so avoid systematic over-ordering. With lead time 0 and no in-transit stock, ordering the mean (107) balances capturing expected sales while limiting holding cost risk. The recent demand sequence doesn't show a sustained regime shift (no 3+ period persistent increase or decrease), so no carry-over insight update is warranted.\n\nFinal action: Place an order for 107 units (arrives same period).

There are no in-transit units and no signs of lost shipments in the recent history.\n\n2) Inventory & demand context: On-hand = 21, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples used by OR (and available in the environment) give a single-period mean \u2248 106.4 (from the 5-sample series 88,133,93,108,110). Recent realized demands (Periods 4\u20138 and beyond) are variable but centered near this level, so the OR baseline mean remains a reasonable anchor.\n\n3) OR recommendation check: OR recommends ordering 85 units. With base_stock \u2248 106.4 and pipeline_inventory = on-hand + in-transit = 21, order_raw \u2248 106.4 \u2212 21 \u2248 85.4, so OR's 85 matches the uncapped base-stock logic. Given profit = holding cost ($1/$1), the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u21d2 z* = 0, so the base-stock is the mean demand; no extra safety stock is called for by the cost parameters.\n\n4) Adjustment decision: Because actual lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive this period and be available to meet demand. On-hand (21) + OR order (85) yields \u2248106 units, matching the estimated single-period mean. Demand variability is noticeable but the cost parameters (profit = holding) justify targeting the mean rather than deliberately overstocking. There are no new lead-time or lost-shipment signals that warrant deviating from OR's capped base-stock recommendation.\n\nFinal strategy: Follow OR's recommendation and order 85 units.

The existing carry-over insight already records lead time confirmed as 0 periods; therefore I treat actual lead time as 0 (orders placed now will arrive and be available for the same period's demand). \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no inventory is available to meet Period 10 demand unless we order now. With lead time = 0, an order placed in Period 10 will arrive during Period 10 before demand. \n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Using the recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u20139: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123, 86, 107), the sample mean is about 104.8 units/period. Variability exists (several spikes and troughs) but there is no sustained regime shift across 3+ consecutive periods that would justify deviating from the historical average. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding), implying a critical fractile of 0.5 and zero safety-stock z* under OR's approach, so the OR baseline targets roughly the mean demand. \n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 106 units. That aligns with the calculated recent mean (~105) and with the policy implied by profit/holding parity. The OR baseline uses promised lead time (0) and historical demand; because actual lead time is confirmed 0 and there's no evidence of lost shipments or a sustained demand shift, OR's recommendation is appropriate. \n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision: Place order = 106 units (match OR). This provides inventory to meet expected demand this period while avoiding extra holding cost because profit = holding cost (no incentive to carry extra safety stock beyond mean when fractile = 0.5). \n\nRisk notes: If demand in the next few periods shows a clear upward or downward regime (3+ periods consistent change), I will record a carry-over insight and adjust future orders accordingly.

Carry-over insight from Period 4 already records lead time confirmed = 0 periods. I therefore treat actual lead time L = 0 (orders arrive same period decision is made).\n\n2) Inventory and pipeline: Current on-hand = 18, in-transit = 0. With L=0, any order placed now will arrive in time for Period 11 demand.\n\n3) Demand estimate: Use recent historical demands (Periods 1\u201310): [111,126,90,124,85,91,123,86,107,88]. Sum = 1031, sample mean = 103.1 units/period. Given L=0, the (1+L)-period demand mean \u03bc\u0302 = 103.1 and \u03c3-term for safety stock is irrelevant because profit = holding cost yields critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0.\n\n4) OR recommendation comparison: OR recommended 87 units. OR used historical mean and its capping rule; its output is close to the calculation below.\n\n5) My order calculation: Target base-stock \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 = 103.1. Pipeline inventory = on-hand + in-transit = 18. order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory \u2248 103.1 \u2212 18 = 85.1. With profit = holding, there is no justification for extra safety stock beyond the mean; demand has been variable but no sustained regime shift. Also there are no in-transit or lost-shipment issues to cover. Therefore I round to 85 units to cover expected Period 11 demand while limiting holding cost.\n\n6) Decision: Place an order of 85 units (arrives this period). This yields expected supply of 18 + 85 = 103 units available versus expected demand \u2248103.1. That balances profit and holding cost given q=0.5.\n\n7) Risk notes: If demand spikes unexpectedly (we've seen several high periods up to 126), we may stock out, but holding cost equals profit so holding extra inventory is not profitable without clear evidence of a sustained higher-demand regime.

OR's internal base-stock (with L=0) is essentially the sample mean \u2248103.4; OR applied rounding/capping to provide 105. OR assumed promised lead time (0) and used all history equally; that matches our confirmed lead time and there is no evidence of a regime shift.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Profit/holding tradeoff and policy decision: Profit = $1/unit and holding cost = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile = 0.5 (z*=0). That makes the mean (\u2248103.4) the appropriate order target to balance stockouts vs. holding.

Given OR's 105 is only slightly above the sample mean, I will trim it to the unrounded sample-mean target.\n\nFinal action: Order 103 units. This gives expected coverage for current-period demand (orders arrive same period) while avoiding a small expected excess inventory that would cost as much per unit as its profit.

Therefore actual lead time = 0 and an order placed now will arrive during this same period and be available to meet demand this period.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline to cover current-period demand, so the order must cover this period's demand entirely.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 10\u201314 = 88, 91, 117, 119, and earlier similar values) average roughly 103\u2013106 units. Historical sample in problem statement (Periods 1\u20135) had mean ~104 as well. There is no calendar or product signal of an upcoming spike; recent demand appears stable around ~104 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation & policy context: OR's capped base-stock recommendation is 106 units. With Profit = Holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* = 0), so optimal base-stock equals the mean demand; OR's cap and historical smoothing produced 106 which matches the observed near-term mean.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision: Follow OR recommendation of 106 units. Rationale: lead time = 0 (so order immediately covers this period), on-hand/pipeline = 0 (need full coverage), recent demand average ~104, and no evidence of a sustained regime change or lost shipments that would require deviating from OR. Because profit equals holding cost, there is no reason to add safety stock beyond OR's suggestion.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk/alternative note: If demand unexpectedly spikes above ~106 this period we will stockout; if demand is lower we incur holding cost of $1 per unit. Given symmetric cost tradeoff and stable recent demand, 106 is an appropriate balanced choice.",

With lead time L=0, the OR base-stock logic (critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 1/(1+1)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) implies a base-stock \u2248 single-period mean \u2248 105 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Reconcile with OR recommendation: OR recommended 103 units.

Current on-hand is 2, so order \u2248103 (105\u22122\u2248103). There is no evidence of regime shift or lost shipments to justify deviating from OR; recent demand has been fairly stable around 100\u2013125 with mean ~104.5.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final decision: Order 103 units. This brings available inventory during Period 16 to ~105 units (2 existing + 103 arriving), matching the mean demand target while avoiding excess holding cost (profit and holding cost are equal, so the 0.5 fractile is appropriate).

This slightly increases units available to sell compared with OR\u2019s 96 recommendation, reducing expected stockouts while keeping holding cost minimal.\n\n5) Risk considerations: If demand falls below the mean, we incur holding cost of any leftover units (holding cost = $1 equals profit per unit).

Their mean = 95.4 units. Earlier sample set (P1\u2013P5) had a higher mean but the most recent five periods show a slightly lower and variable pattern; no sustained regime shift (3+ periods) that would justify raising target above recent mean. Given the product and calendar no additional spike is evident.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation and its assumptions: OR recommends 104 units using historical averages and the promised lead time. OR uses a base-stock approach and a cap that can push orders above the recent mean. However, OR uses the promised lead time and all historical samples equally and does not account for the confirmed LT=0 or recent downward shift in short-run mean.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Cost trade-offs: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost per unit per period = $1, so the critical fractile = 0.5 (z*\u22480). That implies ordering to the expected single-period demand is cost-optimal; over-ordering is costly because leftover inventory incurs the same unit cost as the profit if unsold.\n\nFinal decision logic: Because LT=0, I should directly target expected Period 25 demand. Using recent mean \u224895.4 and the high holding cost relative to profit, it's preferable to err slightly low rather than risk costly ending inventory.

With lead time = 0 we can top-up immediately by ordering in this decision phase.\n\n3) Demand outlook: Historical demand across many periods centers around ~100 units per period with moderate variability; OR\u2019s capped policy recommended 85 units (it uses promised L and the historical samples). Given profit = holding cost (q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0), the OR baseline is essentially targeting the mean demand but its cap reduces swings; 85 is a conservative per-period target.\n\n4) Decision logic vs OR: Because lead time = 0, current on-hand inventory (18) will be available with the order placed now to meet demand this period. To be frugal with holding costs (profit equals holding cost so we avoid excessive inventory) I will accept OR\u2019s target level but reduce the order to account for the 18 units already on-hand. That gives order = max(0, OR_recommendation \u2212 on_hand) = 85 \u2212 18 = 67 units.

Carry-over already recorded lead time = 0; use that here. With lead time = 0, orders placed now will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution and can satisfy current-period demand. There is no in-transit inventory (In-transit=0) and on-hand=6. \n\nStep 2 - Demand assessment: Recent realized single-period demand is roughly 100 units. Using the last 5 periods (P27\u2013P31) demands = {134, 102, 85, 82, 97} \u2192 mean = 100. Historical sample set (earlier provided 5-sample set 88,133,93,108,110) also centers near ~106; overall realized demands across history cluster around ~100. With profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0, so the OR baseline (which effectively targets mean demand) is appropriate. OR recommended 96 units; that is slightly below the recent 100 average. \n\nStep 3 - Inventory target & order calculation: For lead time L=0 the base-stock should be one-period mean (\u2248100). Desired on-hand after arrival \u2248 100. Current on-hand before arrival = 6. No pipeline. Therefore order = target \u2212 on-hand \u2248 100 \u2212 6 = 94 units. This covers expected demand this period while minimizing holding (since holding cost equals profit, the optimal fractile is 0.5 and we should aim for mean). Ordering 94 is close to OR's 96 but adjusts up to the recent realized mean instead of OR's slightly lower cap.\n\nStep 4 - Risk checks: With lead time 0 there is minimal forecast risk from pipeline uncertainty. Demand variance exists (occasional spikes like 134) but q=0.5 implies balancing stockouts vs holding equally; choosing 94 (slightly conservative relative to OR) gives expected good service without excess holding. \n\nConclusion: Order 94 units for chips(Regular) to bring expected on-hand (after arrival) to ~100 units to meet the single-period expected demand given confirmed lead time 0 and recent average demand \u2248100.",

Recent periods (Periods 30\u201334) demands = {82, 97, 107, 89, 127} with an average \u2248100.4, so the single-period expected demand is about 100 units.

Given Profit = $1 and Holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the OR base-stock equals the expected demand over the review+lead horizon (here single-period demand). With confirmed lead time = 0, no additional pipeline cover is necessary beyond expected single-period demand. OR's cap and smoothing produce 103, which is consistent with the ~100 expected demand and modest buffer for variability.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory action reasoning: On-hand + in-transit = 0, so ordering \u2248 expected demand is appropriate.

With on-hand 10, that yields available inventory \u2248103 upon arrival (10 + 93), which aligns well with the recent-period mean demand (~103). Given Profit = Holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 implying the optimal policy targets the mean demand (i.e., little built-in safety stock).

With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period before demand is realized, so available inventory for demand = 9 + order_qty.\n\n3) Demand outlook: Historical demand has been relatively stable around ~100 units per period (recent five-period demands: 127, 93, 112, 81, 93 \u2192 mean \u2248 101). No calendar or product-seasonality signals are present to indicate an imminent spike or drop. Profit = $1 and holding = $1 imply a critical fractile q = 0.5, so little safety stock is required beyond expected single-period demand.\n\n4) OR recommendation: OR (capped base-stock) recommends ordering 93 units. That aligns well with recent-demand estimates (~100) when combined with current on-hand = 9 (9 + 93 \u2248 102 available). Given confirmed lead time = 0 and stable demand, the OR quantity is appropriate.\n\n5) Final decision: Follow the OR recommendation of 93 units.

Profit and holding costs are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding) so the critical fractile is 0.5 and the OR's policy appropriately targets the mean demand rather than adding safety stock.\n4) Decision and trade-offs: Because lead time is confirmed 0 and demand shows no sustained upward regime shift, ordering exactly OR's recommended 102 units balances expected sales against holding cost (minimizes overstock risk given equal profit/holding).

Looking at the most recent demand (Periods 38\u201342 = 93, 114, 82, 61, 97) the average is 89.4 units; recent demand appears slightly below OR's recommendation. Variability exists (sd elevated due to 61 and 114), but there's no strong sustained upward regime shift.\n4) Cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit per period = $1, so the critical fractile = 0.5 (OR's policy therefore centers on mean demand). With holding cost equal to profit, excess inventory is costly and provides no extra expected profit benefit versus the risk of a stockout.\n5) Decision vs OR: OR = 101. Given confirmed lead time 0, on-hand 0 (order will satisfy this period), and recent average demand ~89.4, I reduce OR's order slightly to avoid unnecessary holding.

The provided carry-over insight already confirms actual lead time = 0. Use that when interpreting OR assumptions.\n2) Current inventory/pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline to cover current-period demand, so the order placed now must cover Period 47 demand (lead time 0 means it will arrive during Period 47).\n3) Demand outlook: Recent realized demand is around 100 units. Using the last five concluded periods (P42\u2013P46) demands = [97, 102, 108, 91, 102], average = 100.0. Historical sample set used by OR (earlier sample mean \u2248106.4) and the OR recommendation (101) are consistent with recent demand.\n4) OR recommendation: OR suggests 101 units (it uses promised lead time and historical demand). Given confirmed lead time = 0, zero on-hand, and recent average \u2248100, the OR quantity is appropriate. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit = $1, holding = $1), so newsvendor critical fractile is 0.5 and we should target roughly mean demand with minimal safety stock.\n5) Decision: Follow OR and order 101 units. This provides expected coverage for current-period demand while avoiding excess holdings given holding cost equals profit. It also keeps behavior consistent with observed demand patterns.\n6) Risk notes: If we observe a sustained demand shift (3+ periods) or any lost shipments, I will record a carry-over insight and adjust orders accordingly.\n\nFinal action: order 101 units for chips(Regular).",

{
  "rationale": "Summary of observations and inference:\n- Lead time: Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201347) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were ordered; carry-over insight already records lead time confirmed as 0. I therefore treat actual lead time L = 0.\n- Current inventory state (Period 48 decision time): on-hand = 12, in-transit = 0. Because L = 0, any order placed now would arrive during Period 48 (demand in Period 48 occurs after arrival) and will be available for the same period's demand.\n- Demand forecast: The OR baseline used historical samples and recommended 89 units. Using the provided early-sample mean (Period_1\u20135 demand: 88,133,93,108,110) yields single-period mean \u2248 106.4 units. The OR's capped procedure (with equal profit and holding cost implying critical fractile q=0.5 and z*=0) produces a base-stock near the mean ~106; cap reduced its final order to 89. Given the large gap between current on-hand (12) and expected single-period demand (~106), ordering only 89 would likely understock (12+89 = 101 < 106 expected demand) and produce lost sales.\n- Objective alignment: Profit and holding cost are both $1/unit; lost sales directly reduce Profit\xd7units_sold and avoiding stockouts for the coming period is higher priority than a small additional holding cost on the handful of extra units.\nFinal decision logic and quantity:\n- Required to cover one period (L+1 = 1) of expected demand: target inventory \u2248 single-period mean \u2248 106 units.\n- Subtract current available on-hand + in-transit (12 + 0 = 12) \u2192 order \u2248 106 \u2212 12 = 94 units.\n- I therefore order 94 units (rounded to integer). This is a modest increase above OR's 89, bringing total available stock this period to ~106, matching the expected demand and reducing probability of stockout while only incurring small incremental holding cost.\n- Risk notes: If actual realized demand this specific period is substantially below the mean, holding cost will rise by at most the extra units held; but given the historical demand center around ~100\u2013110 and high cost of lost sales (profit foregone), this order is justified.\n",

Inventory & demand: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no available stock to meet Period 50 demand unless we order now.
