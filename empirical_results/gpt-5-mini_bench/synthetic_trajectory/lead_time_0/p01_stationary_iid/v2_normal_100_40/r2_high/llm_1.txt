Five-period average = 93 units. There's variability (range 39\u2013143) but no sustained shift identified. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: supplier promised lead time = 0 periods, but no concluded arrivals yet to contradict that. Per instructions, do not assume a lead-time change without concluded evidence. I'll therefore assume the promised 0-period lead time for this decision, while remaining cautious in future periods. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so nothing available to meet Period_1 demand. e) Final order logic: with high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1 per period), it's profitable to stock expected demand for the upcoming period. Using the 5-period average (93 units) as the demand forecast for Period_1 and assuming same-period arrival, I order 93 units to meet expected sales while avoiding excessive holding cost. If arrivals later show lead-time problems or sustained demand changes, future orders will be adjusted accordingly.",

Demand history from concludes: Period 1 demand = 3, Period 2 demand = 17. Current on-hand = 83, in-transit = 0. Lead-time analysis: supplier promised 0 and two consecutive conclude messages confirmed arrived=ordered with lead_time 0; while this is encouraging, the carry-over rule requires 3+ periods of consistent evidence before recording a sustained change, so I will not record a formal insight yet. Demand forecast & order logic: Recent realized demand is very low (3 then 17). With promised and observed lead_time = 0 (so orders would arrive same period), the decision must ensure on-hand + in-transit covers (L+1)=1 period of demand (i.e., current-period demand occurring after decision). On-hand 83 already far exceeds recent single-period demand and any reasonable short-term spike implied by history. Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit per sale is $19; however excessive inventory only reduces reward via holding cost.

No evidence of lost shipments. Given two consistent observations, the supplier appears to be delivering within the same period (lead_time=0), so an order placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 4 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=2, in-transit=0.

Increasing Q beyond 52 reduces R by $1 per extra unit (holding cost) so the minimal Q to meet demand (Q=52) is optimal. If Q<52, units_sold =43+Q and ending_inventory=0, R=19*(43+Q), which is strictly increasing in Q up to Q=52 (marginal benefit $19 > marginal holding cost effect).

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive during Period 41 and can satisfy Period 41 demand. Demand analysis: Recent realized demands are volatile but elevated: Periods 36\u201340 demands = [118, 167, 150, 11, 182]; average = ~126 units. Several recent spikes (150\u2013182) produced stockouts when inventory was insufficient (e.g., Period 40: demand 182, sold 129). Given the large profit margin vs holding cost, we bias toward availability to avoid lost high-margin sales. Order logic: Place enough stock to cover a high-but-reasonable demand draw (average ~126 plus safety for volatility). I choose a conservative supply level of 160 units to substantially reduce the risk of stockouts this period while accepting modest expected holding cost if demand is lower. No evidence of any new sustained regime or lead-time change beyond the already recorded lead_time=0.",
