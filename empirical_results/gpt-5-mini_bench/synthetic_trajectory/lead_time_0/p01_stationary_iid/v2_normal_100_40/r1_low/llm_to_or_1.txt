Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrival history to infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) are the only demand evidence: [143,103,39,81,99] with mean ~93.0 and moderate variability. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence to deviate, so I keep L as default (promised). I also select default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std(all samples). Using defaults avoids overfitting to very short history and lets the OR engine apply the base-stock formula with its caps. This balances service level versus holding cost given equal profit and holding cost ($1 each) and limited data.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Recent concluded info: Period 1 order of 93 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=93, lead_time observed=0). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) have mean 93 units/period (samples: 143,103,39,81,99). The concluded lead-time evidence (Period1) matches the promised lead time of 0, so I retain the default promised lead time. Using default methods lets the OR engine compute base_stock from the full-sample mean and std: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples. This choice is conservative given limited new evidence of a regime shift and the confirmed 0-period lead time; it lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost using the full-sample demand stats. Note on inventory posture: on-hand 55 vs full-sample mean demand ~93 indicates we are below average demand \u2014 the OR engine, given these parameters, will order to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the computed base stock. If lead times or demand show sustained change over multiple periods, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast in future periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. History shows two concluded arrivals: Period1 order arrived with lead_time=0 and Period2 order arrived with lead_time=0, so actual lead time is consistent with the promised 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no overdue or lost shipments to account for. Demand samples (periods 1\u20135): 143,103,39,81,99 \u2014 noisy but no sustained regime change (no 3+ period shift). Given stable observed lead time and no confirmed demand regime change, use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively: profit and holding cost are equal so the backend will target roughly the median service level (q=0.5) via its base-stock formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [143,103,39,81,99] (mean=93). Concluded arrivals from Periods 1-3 show all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed in P1,P2,P3 arrived in same period). No evidence of a sustained demand regime shift (recent samples are mixed) and no delayed/lost shipments. Given very low on-hand and zero pipeline, we need the OR engine to target the full (1+L)-period demand. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (L=default) because observed lead times so far are 0 and not inconsistent; mu_hat default to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean_overall (captures average demand across all samples) and sigma_hat default to reflect overall demand volatility. These settings balance service level (by stocking to mean demand) against holding cost; if future periods show persistent delays or a demand shift, I'll switch to recent_N or explicit estimates.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: on-hand=87, in-transit=0. Demand history (environment seed) = [143, 103, 39, 81, 99]. Concluded arrivals for Periods 1-4 show every order arriving the same period (P1 arrived in P1, P2 in P2, P3 in P3, P4 in P4), so actual lead time appears to be 0 and is stable. No overdue or missing shipments to account for. Given symmetric profit and holding costs ($1 profit, $1 holding), the OR backend base-stock formula will balance service level via q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5; using default methods keeps forecasts based on full-sample mean/variance, which is appropriate because I see no recent demand regime shift (demand samples are variable but show no sustained change). Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This provides a stable forecast and avoids overreacting to period-to-period noise while allowing the backend capped ordering to control order sizes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived in P1, P2->P2, P3->P3, P4->P4).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Periods 1\u20135). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so nothing will arrive during Period 6 decision window. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 = 143,103,39,81,99) will be used to set the forecast. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded messages consistently show same-period arrivals. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available samples; this balances service level against holding cost automatically via the backend's z* calculation. Using defaults avoids overreacting to the single large spike in Period 5 (not yet a sustained regime change) and keeps orders sufficient to cover expected immediate-period demand while limiting holding exposure given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (Periods 1-4,6 arrived with lead_time=0) so actual lead time remains confirmed as 0. Recent demand has risen: last 3 concluded demands = [0, 152, 126] (Periods 4-6). I treat this as a short recent regime shift toward higher demand but keep the sample window minimal (N=3) to react quickly while respecting the rule that N>=3. Therefore: L uses default (promised lead time 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent elevated demand (1+L times mean of last 3 samples). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend\u2019s base-stock responsive to the recent uptick while limiting overreaction to single-period noise; with profit=holding, the backend will target service but avoid excessive inventory through the capped order rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 8. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Past concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals observed in P1-P4,P6-P7). Recent demand (concluded) by period: P5=152, P6=126, P7=51 \u2014 higher and more variable than earlier samples, indicating a potential short-lived spike starting at P5 but with some reversion in P7. Because lead time is well-confirmed as 0, I keep L at the promised/default. For demand I bias the forecast to the most recent regime to be responsive to the P5\u2013P7 pattern: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (captures P5\u2013P7 mean demand across the review+lead window). Similarly, use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect current volatility. This choice instructs the OR backend to target service for the near-term elevated mean while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; with L=0 that avoids over-ordering for older historical means but still protects against short-term high demand. Given profit and holding cost are equal, this responsive setting balances unit profit versus holding cost by using recent demand signals rather than the longer historical average.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: on-hand=25, in-transit=0, recent concluded demands show high variability including a one-time spike at Period 5 (152) and elevated demand in Periods 6\u20138 but not a sustained new regime. Carry-over already confirmed lead time = 0 (observed across multiple concludes). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals are consistently same-period, so use the default lead-time handling. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set; this is conservative given demand variability and avoids overreacting to the isolated spike at P5. With L=0 the backend's base-stock calculation will directly trade off profit vs holding cost (profit = holding cost) via the q ratio; default stats let the capped policy limit orders, preventing excessive inventory while maintaining service level. Given no in-transit units and on-hand=25, this will signal ordering toward the statistically justified base stock.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 context: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals in P1-P4 and P6-P9; no evidence of lost shipments). Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 152,126,51,85,65) shows elevated variability and a demand spike in P5-P6; overall recent mean is ~95.8 units. On-hand = 20, in-transit = 0, so without ordering we'll likely stock out given recent average demand. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit = $1, holding = $1) so target service quantile q = 0.5 (z* = 0) making base_stock \u2248 mu_hat. To protect against the recent high-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding, I set demand forecasts based on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 5-9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L uses default promised lead time = 0, consistent with observed arrivals. This gives the OR backend a mu_hat that reflects the recent higher-demand periods (so it replenishes to roughly one-period recent mean) and a sigma_hat based on recent volatility to size safety stock. With on-hand=20 and no in-transit, the OR engine will compute order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap) and should place an order to bring inventory closer to the recent-demand level while capping extreme order sizes.

Demand history (concluded periods) has shown variability but no sustained regime shift. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so service-level target q = 0.5. With lead time confirmed as 0 and no overdue shipments, I will use default/moment-based estimates so the OR backend uses its standard base-stock calculation: base_stock = (1+L)*mean_demand + z*\xb7sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps parameters simple, leverages full sample history, and avoids overreacting to short-term demand fluctuations while keeping inventory sufficient to meet next-period demand (1+L coverage).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P11) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed at Period 5 and every conclude since). Recent demand appears variable with a high recent spike (P11=115) and a very low period (P10=6). Because lead time is confirmed as 0, orders arrive same period and we must cover current-period demand risk. I use a recent-window demand estimate to react to the most recent regime (last 5 periods P7\u2013P11) which captures the recent volatility and the large spike at P11. Therefore: L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands = responsive to recent spike. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock. These choices balance service level (respond to the P11 spike) while avoiding excessive holding cost by not using the long-run mean which mixes older low/high regimes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision. Recent history (Periods 1\u201312 conclude) consistently shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed: every concluded arrival that lists an order shows lead_time = 0 (P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3, P4\u2192P4, P6\u2192P6, P7\u2192P7, P8\u2192P8, P9\u2192P9, P10\u2192P10, P12\u2192P12). On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0 at decision time, so we must cover current period demand plus expected lead-time exposure. Profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period imply q = 0.5 so the OR backend will target a service level around 50%; using baseline demand statistics is appropriate. I choose to let the backend infer lead time from observed concludes (method = calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps parameters conservative but responsive given confirmed 0-period lead time and the volatile demands seen (large spikes at P5 and P11). Using defaults lets the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using the full sample set, balancing fill rate vs holding cost without overfitting to recent spikes.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Recent demand history (Periods 11-13 = 115, 94, 172) shows a sustained, higher-demand regime starting at Period 11 after ten earlier periods with lower average demand. Promised lead time is 0 and earlier conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0, so use default lead time. To respond to the confirmed increase in demand I set demand estimates using the most recent 3 periods (the new regime length) so the OR engine will target stock for the higher demand. Specifically: L uses 'default' (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 periods (captures the new higher mean). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to capture volatility in the new regime. This raises target base-stock and order caps to reduce stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while accepting holding cost tradeoffs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg increased from 70.9 (Periods 1-10) to 127.0 (Periods 11-13), +79.1 (+111%), sustained 3 periods

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-14 arrivals matched same-period orders), and a demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 11 (Periods 11-14 show sustained higher demand). Recent demands (Periods 11-14) = [115, 94, 172, 114] with a higher mean than Periods 1-10. No outstanding/overdue shipments (in-transit=0). Because lead time is reliably 0, orders arrive same period; we should size replenishment to cover the elevated recent-demand regime rather than the long-run mean. Therefore: set L using default (promised = confirmed 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the confirmed higher-demand regime: Periods 11-14). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility (keeps safety stock responsive to current variability). These choices help the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet the higher service-level implied by recent demand while keeping holding cost in check by using only the recent regime for mean and variability estimates.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 11 (Periods 11-15 demands: 115, 94, 172, 114, 82; recent mean \u2248115.4). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 \u2014 far below the recent-period mean demand, so we should replenish to the new regime level. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (confirmed earlier), so use the default (promised) lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed regime shift (regime length=5 periods, choose N=5 per changepoint guidance). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) so the backend measures recent volatility (important because variance rose in the spike at Period 13). These choices steer the OR engine to target the new higher base stock while reflecting recent variability; that balances service level (avoid lost sales) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost (q\u22480.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. History shows confirmed lead time = 0 (many concluded arrivals same period). Recent demand has been elevated versus early periods and somewhat volatile: last 5 realized demands (Periods 12-16) = [94, 172, 114, 82, 80], avg \u2248 108.4; I treat this recent window as the best indicator of near-term demand because the earlier sharp spike (Period 13) and subsequent moderation create a new short-run regime. Current inventory: on-hand=36, in-transit=0, so we are exposed to a likely next-period demand ~108. To balance service level vs holding cost (profit=holding both $1), I use a recent_N demand estimate so the OR backend targets stock for the elevated recent mean while sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect higher variability. Lead time set to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals. No single-period lost shipments evident. This choice helps the OR engine compute a base-stock tuned to current elevated demand and its volatility, avoiding persistent stockouts while limiting excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0). Recent demand shows variability: the long-run historical samples include an earlier low regime and a brief spike (Period 13 = 172). The most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 13-17 = 172,114,82,80,76) average ~104.8 which balances the recent spike and the subsequent lower demands and better represents near-term demand than the full-sample mean. On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0; with promised lead time 0, orders arrive same period, so we should target a one-period demand forecast. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm lead time 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest regime that includes the large spike but also the more recent lower periods; this yields (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples (effectively the one-period forecast). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility instead of the full-sample std. These choices give the OR engine a forecast that responds to the recent high-variance pattern while not overreacting to a single extreme outlier, helping balance service level vs holding cost given profit and holding cost are equal.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier); recent demand regime increased from Period 11 onward and has been sustained. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (periods 11\u201318 form the higher-demand regime; regime_length=8 \u2192 N=8) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)-period demand under the new regime and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and no pipeline while avoiding unnecessary long-term holding since holding cost equals profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-29.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: promised lead time=0 and concluded history (P1->P19) consistently shows actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand = 70, in-transit = 0. Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime starting at Period 11 (noted in carry-over): demand rose materially vs. earlier periods and has persisted through Period 19. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit each), I will trust the confirmed lead time (L=default -> 0) and base demand forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. I detect the changepoint at Period 11; the recent regime spans Periods 11\u201319 (9 periods). Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=9) focuses the (1+L)-period demand forecast on this higher regime so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet current demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=9) to reflect volatility of the recent regime rather than earlier low-demand periods. This combination (L=default, mu_hat recent_N N=9, sigma_hat recent_N N=9) signals the OR engine to increase target inventory to improve fill rates while the recent volatility estimate tempers the safety stock so we don't overcommit inventory given holding cost equals profit.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 (orders in P1\u2013P20 arrived same period), so promised lead time=0 is reliable. Demand history shows a sustained upward regime beginning at Period_11 (noted previously): recent 10 periods (P11\u2013P20) contain higher and more variable demand than P1\u2013P10. Because the demand regime change is sustained (10 periods) I use a recent-window forecast to let the OR engine target the current higher mean and volatility. I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (the regime length from Period_11\u2013Period_20) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 10 samples. This raises the base-stock to protect service level under the new higher-demand regime while the OR engine's cap limits extreme orders to control holding cost. With zero pipeline and zero on-hand, this approach prevents expected stockouts from the sustained higher demand.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals recorded each period). Current on-hand=53, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory=53. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 11 (documented in carry-over), so I bias forecasts toward the post-change regime. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because arrivals have consistently matched that. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 11-21) to capture the higher post-changepoint mean and recent volatility; N=11 equals the length of the new regime and is within the allowed bounds. This raises the base_stock to better cover higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock reflecting elevated variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts under the new higher regime) against holding cost by restricting the window to the confirmed regime rather than the older low-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over note). Demand since Period 11 has been in a higher regime; Periods 11-22 average demand = 102.5 units (12 periods), up from the earlier regime. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0 and there are no overdue/lost shipments. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 11-22 mean = 102.5; (1+L)\xd7mean = 102.5). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent volatility (std of Periods 11-22 \u2248 36.99). These parameters bias the OR engine toward stocking for the higher recent demand while keeping holding risk reasonable given equal profit and holding cost (profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 implies moderate service level). Using recent_N avoids diluting the new regime with older low-demand periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. Current on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), and there are no overdue or missing arrivals to reconcile. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) so the newsvendor service quantile is 0.5 (z\u22480) and the backend will naturally target expected demand across the review+lead period. Given the confirmed 0 lead time and no new sustained demand/lead-time changepoints since the previously recorded regime shift, I use the defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history. This keeps the solution robust to historical variability, lets the OR backend set base stock using its full-sample estimates, and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while ensuring on-hand + pipeline planning for the immediate period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand since Period_11 has been in a higher regime (sustained through Period_24). Because the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 11\u201324) is the most relevant for forecasting, I set L to the default (use promised lead time = 0) and used recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering Periods 11\u201324). This uses the most recent regime data to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, producing a higher base-stock that better covers current demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to observed volatility. With profit = holding, service-level target is moderate (q = 0.5); using recent regime statistics helps the OR backend avoid chronic understocking given the sustained increase in demand. Also flagged that there are no in-transit units, so orders should replenish to the computed base-stock promptly.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals always same period) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 11 (higher mean since then). Current on-hand = 9, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low versus the elevated recent demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) implying q=0.5 and z*\u22480, so the OR backend will effectively target the (1+L)-period demand forecast (mu_hat) while capping orders via its cap. To capture the post-Period-11 higher-demand regime, I set demand estimates using the most recent regime data (Periods 11\u201325 = 15 samples). I choose recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime, producing higher base-stock targets appropriate for the sustained uplift. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows same-period arrivals. This approach balances service (use recent elevated mean to avoid stockouts) against holding cost (q=0.5 causes moderate service target; sigma_hat from recent data informs safety stock and the OR cap prevents extreme over-ordering).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. A sustained demand regime shift was previously detected starting Period 11 (higher mean from Periods 11-13 onward). To respect that regime shift and prioritize service (profit and holding cost are equal, so OR backend will target ~50% critical fractile), I use a recent_N forecast anchored on the post-changepoint regime. The regime from Period 11 through Period 26 spans 16 periods of elevated demand; using N=16 captures that sustained higher demand and recent variability. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=16) directs the OR engine to size base stock to the new demand level and measured volatility, while keeping lead time as default (0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. This balances service (meeting higher demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand evidence rather than diluting with older lower-demand samples.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Recent realized demand (Periods 23-27) = [72,72,90,132,74], recent mean = 88.0 which reflects the higher-demand regime already recorded (Period 11+). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time of 0 (validated historically). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent behavior (captures the currently higher regime while smoothing short noise). This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean tied to current demand (mu_hat \u2248 88), and sigma_hat based on recent sample variability \u2014 these settings let the OR engine compute a base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to single spikes. Given profit = holding, the backend will target a 50% quantile (z*=0), so aligning mu_hat to recent demand helps balance service level vs holding cost. I also note there are no in-transit units and no overdue arrivals to account for, so we must replenish from on-hand shortfall proactively.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods show orders arriving same period they were placed). Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 72, 90, 132, 74, 94) shows a stable elevated regime since Period 11; use a short recent window to capture current mean and volatility. I choose L='default' (promised lead time 0, aligned with confirmed arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent consumption pattern (mean \u2248 92.4 units) so the OR base-stock will target current demand rather than being diluted by older low-demand periods. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility (so safety stock scales to recent variability). With Profit = Holding cost, the OR backend targets median (q=0.5) so base-stock \u2248 mu_hat; using recent data balances service level (avoid stockouts from recent higher demand) against holding cost by not over-weighting older low-demand history. Because on-hand + pipeline = 0, these settings will prompt replenishment sized to recent demand and volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 decision. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand regime shifted up at Period 11 and has persisted; recent periods (P11\u2013P29) show materially higher mean than P1\u2013P10. To align the OR engine to the sustained higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11\u201329) so mu_hat reflects the higher average demand across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; N=19 (regime length P11\u2013P29 = 19). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N to capture current volatility. This raises the base_stock to match the new demand level while keeping z* = 0 (profit=holding \u21d2 q=0.5), so orders will target the updated mu_hat. This approach addresses the risk of understocking given the sustained higher demand and the confirmed zero lead time, while avoiding overstating uncertainty.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (many concluded same-period arrivals) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 11. Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we need replenishment to meet ongoing elevated demand. I choose the backend defaults: L=default to trust the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical demand samples (captures the post-changepoint elevated mean); sigma_hat=default so the engine uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. Using defaults leverages the full sample history (including the confirmed demand shift) while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with concluded evidence. This balances service level (by reflecting the higher mean) against holding cost via the OR engine's critical ratio and cap logic.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 context: on-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a confirmed regime shift starting Period 11 (higher mean sustained since then). Promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in past concluded messages. With virtually no pipeline and current on-hand very low, we must target the higher post-changepoint demand. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 12\u201331 are included in the recent window) so mu_hat reflects the post-changepoint mean over the most relevant recent data and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts in the new regime while keeping variance-based safety stock to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit (conservative service level).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period delivery (lead_time observed = 0 across many concluded periods), and there is a previously recorded demand regime shift upward starting at Period 11 that appears sustained. Because there are no overdue or in-transit shipments to reconcile, I keep lead time at the promised/default (0) to match observed behavior. To keep the OR engine responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime, I base demand estimates on the most recent data window: use recent_N over the last 20 demand samples (captures the post-shift behavior while smoothing short-term noise). I apply the same recent_N=20 for volatility to reflect current variability. These choices keep base_stock aligned with the confirmed faster deliveries (L=0) and the elevated demand regime, balancing service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost by using a recent-window forecast rather than the long-run mean that blends pre-shift low demand.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0; demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning Period 11 (documented previously). Recent demand (Periods 14\u201333) remains higher than early periods, so I focus the forecast on the most recent regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-period fulfillment. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 20 concluded samples (captures the post-changepoint higher mean while smoothing short-term noise). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than the full-sample std; this helps the OR engine compute a base stock that better balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding. This choice avoids overreacting to early low-demand samples while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35 context: on-hand=5, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0, historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand history (Periods 1\u201334) shows an overall mean \u2248 89.2 units/period with no recent sustained regime shift beyond previously recorded insights. Given lead time confirmed as 0 and stable demand statistics over many periods, use default methods so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std. This keeps service levels appropriate (orders arrive same period ordered) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit. Defaults balance service vs. holding cost and rely on the large sample set to estimate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. Immediate reconciliation: with on-hand=5 and no in-transit, the engine will order toward the full-sample-based base stock to cover current-period demand post-decision.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals strongly confirm actual lead time = 0 (many periods with arrived=ordered same period). Recent demand has been consistently elevated since the shift at Period 11; the last 10 concluded demands remain around ~80\u2013135 (higher than earliest periods). To prioritize service (profit = holding cost) I focus the forecast on the most recent regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, supported by many concluded 0-L observations) and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock targeting current higher mean and observed recent volatility. This increases order targets to avoid stockouts given zero pipeline and elevated recent demand while the sigma estimate captures recent demand variability so the capped order will limit extreme ordering given holding cost equal to profit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in prior concluded periods (confirmed at Period 5 and repeatedly thereafter), and there are no outstanding or overdue shipments to reconcile. Recent demands in concluded history show substantial variability but no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded increase around Period 11\u201313. Given the confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost/delayed orders, I keep the lead time at the promised/default. To let the OR engine compute the replenishment target using its full-sample demand estimates (which smooths variability and leverages many periods of data), I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service level versus holding cost by relying on the engine's base-stock calculation using all historical samples and the confirmed L=0, avoiding overreaction to short-term fluctuations while ensuring enough coverage for current demand uncertainty.

[RETRY 1/3] API error: Request timed out.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: promised lead time = 0 and concluded history (through Period 37) repeatedly shows arrivals with lead_time=0, so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent demand is clearly in the higher regime (carry-over previously confirmed at Period 11). Current on-hand = 7, in-transit = 0, so immediate coverage is very low versus recent demand. To keep service while limiting excess holding cost, I set L to the promised/default (0). For demand forecasting I use a recent_N estimator over the most recent regime: I select N=20 (the last 20 periods, Periods 18\u201337) because the elevated-demand regime is long and sustained; the 20-point window captures current mean (~94.6 units/period) and current volatility. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the up-to-date regime, which raises the base-stock to meet the higher demand while the capped order size prevents excessive single-period ordering and controls holding cost. No overdue shipments or lead-time anomalies to adjust for.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: on-hand=40, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent history shows moderately high and volatile demand with many periods of stockouts when starting inventory was low; current on-hand (40) is small relative to typical single-period demand (many past demands in 70-130 range). Given confirmed lead time = 0, use the backend defaults so the OR engine will compute base_stock using the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (protecting against frequent single-period stockouts) and holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* from profit vs holding cost and apply the capped ordering. I therefore select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the engine uses all historical samples with L=promised (0) to produce an appropriate order recommendation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we currently have no coverage for Period 40 demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over insights), so using the backend's default (promised) lead time is appropriate. There is a known demand regime shift around Period 11 (higher mean sustained), but no new sustained changepoint since the last insight. I select L=default to keep lead-time = promised (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default calculations so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages the full historical demand sample set and the backend's capped ordering rule to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost. This approach ensures the engine has consistent inputs (no explicit/hand-tuned forecasts) while respecting confirmed same-period arrivals and avoiding overreaction to short-term fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. History shows actual lead time consistently 0 (concluded arrivals every period matched same-period orders). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover this period's demand risk entirely with the order decision. Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 80, 84, 55, 118, 138) is higher and more volatile than the long-run early-period samples; there is no new multi-period sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded shift around Period 11. To be responsive to the recent elevated/variable demand, I set L to the promised/default (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (the last 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects the most recent demand level (captures the recent spike in P40). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices push the OR engine to place a base stock sized to recent demand and its variability, balancing service level (avoid lost sales given zero observed lead time) against holding cost by not over-weighting older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed in earlier carry-over). Recent demand has been elevated compared with earliest periods (a regime shift around Period 11 was previously recorded), and demand samples through Period 41 remain mixed but with many high-demand periods; however there is no new 3+ period sustained change since the last recorded insight. Given confirmed same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and no new sustained changepoint, use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps ordering responsive (same-period arrivals) while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost automatically. No special explicit inflation of mu_hat or sigma_hat is applied now because on-hand plus immediate order capability (L=0) already lets us respond to demand spikes without carrying excessive inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time reliably 0 (confirmed earlier). There was a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_11 (noted in prior carry-over): post-shift demand is materially higher and persisted. To ensure the OR backend captures the higher recent mean and volatility while still using the promised lead time, I set L to default (use promised lead time=0). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the estimate on the most recent regime (captures the sustained higher-demand periods while respecting the N rules: regime length >20 so N=20). This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given current zero inventory and balances holding cost by limiting N to 20 rather than all-history extremes. No evidence of new lead-time issues or lost shipments in the concluded history, so no explicit lead-time adjustment.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201343) confirm actual lead time = 0 repeatedly (arrivals always same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 11 (noted earlier): recent periods (11\u201343) show notably higher mean than Periods 1\u201310. Given the long-run higher-demand regime and zero lead time, I set L to default (promised 0). For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent stable regime (regime length since Period 11 >> 20), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples and sigma_hat uses last 20 sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts under the higher regime) against holding cost by basing the base-stock on the recent higher mean and recent volatility rather than older low-demand data.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 context: on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201344) consistently show lead_time=0, so I keep L at default. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 138, 62, 107, 144, 94) is representative of the current higher-demand regime confirmed earlier (changepoint at Period_11). On-hand + in-transit (4) is far below one-period demand (~109 recent average), so we must target higher replenishment. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current short-term demand level ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This focuses the OR backend on current demand conditions (improving service) while avoiding inflating safety stock from older low-demand periods (limiting holding cost).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 11 (carry-over previously recorded): mean increased materially and has persisted. To capture the higher, sustained demand regime while avoiding over-reacting to single-period spikes, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 20 samples). I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat so the safety stock reflects recent volatility. This setup ensures orders target the elevated recent average demand and appropriate recent volatility while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with confirmed observations, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 (confirmed at Period 5 and every concluded order arrived same period thereafter). Demand history shows a sustained higher regime starting at Period 11 (noted in carry-over). Because recent history (Periods 27-46 especially) remains at a higher average than the earliest periods, I bias forecasts toward recent data to avoid under-ordering and lost sales. I therefore keep L as the default (promised lead time = 0, supported by concluded arrivals). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short noise; this sets the backend's (1+L)*mean on the most relevant recent window. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices help the OR engine raise the base-stock and safety stock to reduce stockouts given zero pipeline and confirmed zero lead time, while not overreacting to single extreme spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: on-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods 43-47) averages ~106 units and shows elevated regime vs early history; no evidence of lost shipments. Promised lead time remains valid, so set L to default (0) so OR backend uses promised lead time. To make the base-stock responsive to the recent higher-demand regime, use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (captures the most recent demand mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than diluted long-run variance. These choices keep base_stock focused on recent demand to avoid stockouts while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5 so z* small). With on-hand=43 and no pipeline, this will prompt orders to replenish toward the recent demand-driven base stock while limiting overstock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 context: on-hand=38, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has been in the higher regime (Period_11+). I therefore keep L at the default (promised) value 0. For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the last 10 periods (Periods 39\u201348) because the post-change regime is well-established and the most recent 10 samples capture current mean/volatility. Last-10 demands: [118,138,62,107,144,94,141,125,58,75], mean=106.2 units, sample std\u224832.6. With L=0 the review+lead multiplier is (1+L)=1, so mu_hat \u2248106.2 and sigma_hat \u224832.6. Operationally: on-hand (38) is well below the one-period expected demand (~106), so using recent_N raises the target base stock to service the elevated regime while sigma_recent provides safety stock for variability. This balances profit vs holding cost by reacting to the sustained higher-demand regime rather than diluting forecasts with older low-demand observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 50. On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (multiple Pn orders arrived same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning Period 11 (noted in carry-over); recent periods remain in the higher-demand regime. With promised lead time 0, use L=default so orders arrive same period if honored. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (backend rule: N = min(regime_length,20), regime since Period 11 -> long enough). This biases the base-stock toward recent higher mean and captures recent volatility, helping the OR engine order enough to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). Given on-hand=44 < recent mean demand, this will produce an order to replenish for same-period demand and protect service level.
