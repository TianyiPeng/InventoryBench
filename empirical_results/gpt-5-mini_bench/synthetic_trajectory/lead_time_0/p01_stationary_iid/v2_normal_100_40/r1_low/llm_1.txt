No calendar events are indicated for Period_1. b) Demand regime analysis: historical samples for this SKU: [P1:143, P2:103, P3:39, P4:81, P5:99]. The 5-period average demand = 93 units. There is one high outlier at P1=143 and one low P3=39; recent periods (P4,P5) around ~90\u2013100. With only five samples and no sustained trend, treat demand as roughly 90\u2013100 units with moderate variability. c) Lead-time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0, but no concluded arrivals yet to confirm. Per rules, we cannot infer actual lead time until a 'conclude' message shows arrivals. Therefore assume arrival could be same-period but remain cautious\u2014we'll not rely on hidden multi-period pipeline. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. If order arrives same period we can meet demand; if it does not, we will incur lost sales. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit ($1), so leftover inventory next period effectively yields zero net benefit (profit \u2212 holding). This argues against large safety stock. e) Final order logic: Balance service (avoid lost sales at $1 profit per unit) vs high holding penalty. Target the central estimate of expected demand (\u224893) but round to a slightly higher integer to guard against variability and the one high historical observation. Therefore order 100 units for Period_1.",

The provided historical demand samples list Period_3 demand ~39 and other periods varying, so recent demand is volatile. Lead-time inference: Period 1 order (100) arrived in the same period (conclude message shows lead_time=0). No contradicting evidence yet, but only one confirmed arrival, so actual lead time is likely 0 but not yet a sustained multi-period confirmation. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all demand this period must come from a new order if we want to avoid stockout. Economics: profit = $1/unit sold, holding cost = $1/unit/period. Holding cost equals profit, so any ending inventory erodes one period's profit per unit; therefore avoid building inventory beyond the expected demand for the immediate period. Forecast & order logic: given volatile recent demand (38 then 103) and historical Period_3 ~39, a simple demand estimate for this period is between the recent average (~70) and the historical Period_3 low (~39). To balance service (avoid stockout) versus very high holding cost, order to roughly meet a one-period demand estimate. I choose a conservative midpoint driven by the recent average: 70 units. This assumes lead time = 0 (supported by P1 evidence), so the order should arrive in-period and can meet Period 3 demand.

Recent mean = (38+103+83)/3 = 74.7 units. The middle two periods show higher demand (~103,83) while Period1 was an outlier low.

Observed arrivals: order placed P1 arrived P1 (lead_time 0) and order placed P3 arrived P3 (lead_time 0). These confirm same-period (0) deliveries for two observed orders. No evidence of lost shipments. However the carry-over rule requires sustained evidence (3+ periods) to record a permanent change, so I will not record an insight.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0.

Inventory economics: profit per unit = $1, holding cost per unit/period = $1. That makes leftover inventory costly: each unit left unsold this period immediately costs as much in holding as a sale would earn in profit. Because lead time = 0, we can place an order this decision that will arrive before demand is realized and exactly top up to our target stock for this period.
