Do not assume a lead-time change without concluded arrivals.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) give mean \u03bc\u0304 = 93 units/period and sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 37.8. With promised L=0, the OR baseline computes \u03bc\u0302 = 93, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 37.8. The product economics imply a high critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1) = 0.95; z* \u2248 1.645. That yields base_stock \u2248 93 + 1.645\xd737.8 \u2248 155 units.

Historical five-sample mean demand = 93 units/period (samples: 143,103,39,81,99). The only concluded realized demand so far is Period 1 demand = 38, but this single low draw is not sufficient to declare a sustained regime shift.\n3) OR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 33 units using promised lead time and historical demand. With confirmed lead time = 0, any order would arrive in Period 2 and be available for demand this period, but we already have 118 on-hand which exceeds the single-period average demand (~93). Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit is $19/unit; excess inventory reduces objective due to holding costs without increasing expected sales in a steady regime.\n4) Decision: Do not place an order this period (order = 0). Rationale: on-hand inventory (118) already covers expected Period 2 demand and provides buffer for variability; ordering more would increase holding cost and risk lower net reward. OR's 33 is reasonable if pipeline were low, but here it's unnecessary.\n5) Monitoring plan: Continue to watch arrivals and realized demand; only resume ordering when pipeline+on-hand approaches the recommended base stock level or if we observe a sustained demand increase over multiple periods.\n",

Orders placed now will arrive within the current period before demand is realized.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & recent demand: On-hand = 15, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples: P1=38, P2=103 \u2192 sample mean \u03bc\u0304 = (38+103)/2 = 70.5 units/period. Sample standard deviation (n-1) \u2248 45.96.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation check: OR recommended 134 units using promised lead time and its capped base-stock. Recomputing with actual lead time L=0: single-period demand \u03bc\u0302 = 70.5, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 45.96.

The OR cap (for L=0) is effectively the same as base-stock here, so the OR final \u2248131; its recommendation of 134 is very close.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision trade-offs: Profit per sold unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so the cost of carrying extra inventory one period is small relative to stockout cost. Recent demand jumped from 38\u2192103, but two periods is insufficient evidence of a sustained regime shift (carry-over rule requires 3+ periods). Given confirmed lead time 0 and high profit, I will align with the statistically derived base-stock while rounding to a practical integer.\n\nFinal action: place order = 131 units.

That means any order placed now will arrive within this same period's arrival resolution and be available to meet Period 4 demand (and will be reported in Period 4 conclude). Current inventory position: on-hand = 63, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands (concludes): P1=38, P2=103, P3=83; the broader historical samples available to OR (143,103,39,81,99) imply a single-period mean near ~93 with sizable variance. Cost tradeoffs: profit = $19/unit, holding = $1/unit \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95, so we want a high service level (OR used this to produce a relatively large target). OR recommends ordering 81 units. If we place 81, with L=0 the inventory available for Period 4 demand becomes 63 + 81 = 144 units, which is ample to cover both typical and occasional high single-period demand (e.g., 143 historical sample) and is consistent with the high critical fractile. Given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19) and confirmed zero lead time, the downside of ordering and holding extra units is small compared to losing sales. Pipeline shows no lost shipments and no overdue arrivals. I therefore follow the OR recommendation (order = 81). This keeps us aligned with the OR base-stock target that accounts for demand mean and safety stock (and respects OR's cap), while leveraging the confirmed same-period arrival to ensure availability for Period 4 demand. No new carry-over insight is recorded because lead-time = 0 was already captured and we do not yet observe a sustained regime or seasonality change.",

This matches the existing carry-over insight. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 144, in-transit = 0. No incoming arrivals are expected because no outstanding pipeline is visible in concluded messages. Demand analysis: Historical demand samples provided by the environment average 93 units/period (samples: 143,103,39,81,99 \u2192 mean 93). Recent realized demands in concluded periods are lower and variable (P1 sold 38, P2 sold 103, P3 sold 83, P4 sold 0; recent 4-period average = 56). OR recommended 5 units; its base-stock cap is designed to prevent large orders when pipeline is low, but it does not consider the observed same-period lead time nor the current large on-hand stock. Risk trade-offs: Each extra unit ordered ties up inventory and incurs $1 holding cost per period while generating $19 profit only if sold. Given high current on-hand (144) and no pipeline, additional ordering risks unnecessary holding costs if demand remains at or below recent levels. Decision: order 0 units. This avoids increasing ending inventory and holding cost while relying on same-period replenishment ability (lead_time=0) if future periods indicate higher demand and OR recommends ordering.

There is no pipeline cover for current period demand, so we must order to cover Period 6 demand plus safety stock.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Use the most recent realized demands (concluded periods): P1=38, P2=103, P3=83, P4=0, P5=152.

Given confirmed lead time = 0, an immediate order will cover Period 6 demand. The OR's cap (163) is conservative; my computed base-stock is slightly higher (~172).

{
  "rationale": "Summary of observations and inference:\n- Lead time: Carry-over insight (Period 2) confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Concluded arrivals in Periods 1,3,4,6 support same-period arrival behavior.\n- Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 46, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive during this period and be available for today's demand.\n- Demand evidence: Historic sample set used by OR (Period_1..Period_5 in environment) has mean \u2248 93. Recent realized demand from game history (Periods 1-6): 38,103,83,0,152,126; 6-period mean \u2248 83.7 with high variance and two large recent draws (152,126), indicating demand has trended up in the last two selling periods. OR's recommendation = 119 (uses its own stats and promised lead time).\n- Service vs. cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $19, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.95 (high). Missing sales is very costly relative to holding. With short/zero lead time, we can top up immediately to avoid stockouts with only one period of holding cost exposure.\n- Target reasoning: Using recent mean (~84) and observed high variability (std \u224856), a high-service target (\u03bc + z*\u03c3, z*\u22481.645) implies a target on-hand near ~176 units to cover same-period demand with safety. With current on-hand 46 and no pipeline, that suggests ordering ~130 units (176 \u2212 46 \u2248 130). OR's capped value (119) is slightly lower; given high profit and two recent large demands, I raise the order modestly above OR to reduce stockout risk.\nFinal decision: Order 130 units. This increases same-period availability to ~176 units (46 on-hand + 130 arriving this period), giving a high service level consistent with the profit/holding tradeoff and recent observed demand spikes.\n\nHow this follows the collaboration strategy:\n- I started from OR's recommendation of 119, compared OR assumptions to reality (confirmed lead time = 0, recent demand spike), and adjusted upward to 130 to reflect the higher realized demand and high penalty for stockouts. The increase is moderate to avoid excessive holding cost while prioritizing sales capture.\n",

This balances the high profit per unit (favoring service) against holding cost ($1/unit/period). Since lead time is confirmed 0, the order will arrive this period and protect against high recent demand spikes (we saw demands as high as 152). I choose 30 rather than OR's 36 to be slightly more conservative on holding cost while still meeting the base-stock target.\n\nFinal check: No lost shipments or late arrivals are evident; in-transit = 0.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 12 and will be available to meet Period 12 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. With L=0 the OR baseline treats the base-stock as a target inventory position (on-hand + on-order).

Demand is variable but the last five periods give a reasonable short-run expectation. OR's capped baseline is 93 units (it uses longer historical samples and the promised lead time).

However, the recent mean demand (~73) is below OR's 93 and demand shows considerable volatility (one very low 6 and one high 115).

Recent realized demands (Periods 10\u201314) = [6, 115, 94, 172, 114], 5-period average \u2248 100 units; the longer-run early-sample mean (Periods 1\u20135 provided in problem statement) \u2248 93, so demand appears roughly 90\u2013110 units per period with occasional spikes (e.g., 172). Cost tradeoffs: profit = $19/unit, holding = $1/unit \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95, which implies a relatively high safety stock (z* \u2248 1.645). OR recommendation: 114 units (OR uses historical mean, promised L=0 and cap). Decision & justification: With confirmed lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive before demand and fully count toward on-hand for this period\u2014so we should order up to the OR base-stock target. Ordering 114 fills on-hand to 165 (51 + 114), which covers about 1.6 times the recent mean and provides safety for spikes while holding costs are low relative to profit. I therefore follow the OR recommendation unchanged. I considered reducing the order because Period 10 was an outlier low (6), but demand in other recent periods has been high; given high profit vs low holding cost and lead time = 0, keeping OR's higher target reduces expected lost sales and maximizes reward.",

The provided carry-over insight already confirms actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand = 83, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 16 before demand is realized and can serve Period 16 demand.\n\nDemand assessment: Use recent demand as the best indicator of near-term customer behavior. The most relevant recent five-period demands (Periods 11\u201315) are: 115, 94, 172, 114, 82. Their mean = 115.4 and sample std \u2248 34.6. Given the product (snack chips) and no calendar events provided, I treat this recent regime as the current demand pattern.\n\nService-level target and safety stock: Profit per unit = $19, holding = $1, so critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

This is the base-stock level we want on-hand to hit the high service target implied by the profit/holding tradeoff.\n\nOrder calculation: Desired on-hand before demand = ~172 units. Current on-hand 83 and in-transit 0, so order = 172 \u2212 83 = 89 units (round to integer). OR recommended 80 units; I increase slightly to 89 because OR used promised L (it did) but also used all historical data equally and produced a cap that underweights the recent higher-demand regime. Recent periods include a very large 172 demand (Period 13), and the high critical fractile justifies extra safety stock. Holding cost is low relative to profit, so the additional inventory risk is acceptable.\n\nRisks and trade-offs: If demand falls back to the long-term lower average, we will hold somewhat more inventory and pay holding cost $1/unit/period; but each unit stocked has high marginal expected profit given 19:1 profit-to-holding tradeoff. Given lead time = 0, we can also adjust next period if demand drops. No additional carry-over insight is recorded because the lead-time confirmation was already captured and the demand shift is not sustained for 3+ periods beyond what we used for calculation.\n\nFinal decision: Order 89 units to bring expected available inventory to ~172 units to meet a 95% service-level target for the current high-demand regime.",

Holding cost is low relative to profit, so the penalty for a little overstock is small compared to lost profit from stockouts.

Using a slightly wider look at recent activity the typical single-period demand is roughly 85\u201395 units; there is variability but no sustained upward regime shift over many periods.\n\nOR recommendation: OR baseline recommends ordering 63 units. That policy uses historical samples and the promised lead time; it seeks to top up pipeline to a base-stock. With lead time = 0, OR\u2019s 63 would immediately add to inventory and raise on-hand from 97 to ~160, exposing us to extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) for excess stock while marginally reducing a small stockout risk we already have low probability of facing this period.\n\nDecision logic and final strategy: Because L=0, the target is to cover one period of demand (L+1 =1). On-hand 97 already comfortably covers the recent average demand (~90) for Period 22. Given the high unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), we do not need to chase extra safety stock this period\u2014especially since pipeline is empty and no lost shipments are indicated. Ordering the OR-recommended 63 would create unnecessary holding cost for inventory unlikely to be sold immediately. Therefore I place no order this period (order = 0).

Inventory & demand analysis: Using the full 23-period demand history gives a single-period mean demand \u2248 87.4 units. Demand variance is substantial (wide daily swings, stdev on the order of ~40 units), and profit/holding ratio is high (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645). OR's capped recommendation is 70 units, but OR uses a different input set and its cap appears low relative to observed mean and the high service-level implied by q.

Decision: Order 66 units (override OR's 70 downward slightly because we already hold 89 on-hand; OR's recommendation is a one-period order number while we prefer to target total on-hand of base-stock). This respects the confirmed 0 lead time so the order will arrive this period and immediately be available to satisfy demand. Risk trade-offs: Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so larger safety stock is justified to avoid lost-profit stockouts. I did not order up to a higher rounded target because the demand estimate and volatility are approximate; a moderate increment (66 units) balances service and holding costs.

Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so expected-sales value of inventory strongly outweighs one-period holding cost; target availability should be near the expected demand.\n\nOR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 75 units, but OR uses promised lead time and its capped formula; its output is lower than the observed single-period mean and ignores the fact we already have only 80 on-hand. Since lead time = 0, we can top up immediately to cover expected demand.\n\nDecision & math: To bring available inventory to about the expected demand (~88\u201390) I will order 10 units (80 on-hand + 10 arriving this period = 90). That balances capturing expected sales (high profit) against a modest holding cost risk. Ordering the full OR suggestion would be unnecessary because it assumes pipeline coverage and its cap logic differs; ordering much more would increase holding cost without proportional sales upside given average demand ~88.\n\nRisk notes: Demand is variable (observed highs and lows), so a small chance of a stockout remains if demand spikes >90 this period. However, given holding cost and current on-hand, ordering 10 is a conservative, profit-oriented tradeoff.\n",

I therefore believe actual lead time = 0 and there are currently no in-transit units (on-hand=56, in-transit=0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand outlook: Historical demand has fluctuated but the long-run single-period mean is near ~90 units (earlier sample periods averaged \u224893 and the broader history centers in the 70\u2013130 range).

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201333) consistently shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (many 'ordered= X, arrived = X (ordered on Period t, lead_time was 0 periods)'). Carry-over already recorded: lead time = 0 periods. Therefore any order placed now (Period 34) will arrive during Period 34 and can satisfy Period 34 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate from history: Using the full realized demand history (Periods 1\u201333), total demand = 2,946 over 33 periods \u2192 mean \u2248 89.3 units/period. Recent periods (P31\u2013P33: 84, 101, 97) are near that mean, so no clear regime shift. Variability is present but not extreme. OR's recommendation (97) is slightly above the long-run mean and is driven by its high service target.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory position and what to order: On-hand = 56, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, ordering now increases on-hand available for the current-period demand. Expected demand \u2248 89 units; given profit per sold unit = $19 and holding cost = $1/unit/period, the cost of a lost sale (missed profit) is large relative to holding. However, ordering far above expected demand creates avoidable holding cost every remaining period. A reasonable operational choice is to top up on-hand to an on-hand target near the expected demand plus a small safety buffer.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 How I adapted OR: OR recommended ordering 97 units (it likely computed an order to reach a larger base-stock). Instead of ordering the full 97, I will bring on-hand up to ~97 total units (on-hand target \u2248 97) by ordering 41 units now (56 + 41 = 97). This matches OR\u2019s effective target inventory level but avoids the OR\u2019s larger order quantity that would further inflate pipeline/inventory (OR\u2019s value looked like an order quantity rather than a fill-to level). Ordering 41 units gives expected availability for this period near OR\u2019s service objective while limiting unnecessary holding cost.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risks & mitigation: If demand surprises on the upside (>>100), we may incur some lost sales this period, but given the very favorable profit-to-holding ratio, a more aggressive policy could be justified; nonetheless the recent demands cluster around 80\u2013110, so the chosen target balances stockout risk and holding cost.\n\nFinal decision: order 41 units so that on-hand becomes ~97 units this period.\n",

All subsequent concluded arrivals show same-period arrivals, so I treat L=0 going forward.\n- Inventory snapshot: On-hand = 73, In-transit = 0 (no pipeline visible).\n- Demand evidence: Historical sample set provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) gives mean \u03bc\u0304 = 93 and sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 37.75. OR uses promised L and these same samples to compute a base-stock.

That recommendation is consistent with reaching the OR base-stock target when accounting for current on-hand (155 \u2212 73 \u2248 82); OR's 79 is slightly lower but in the same neighborhood.\nDecision logic and final action:\n- Because profit >> holding cost (profit = $19, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.95), the system favors keeping safety stock. With confirmed lead time = 0, we can immediately replenish within the same period, so there's no need to inflate pipeline to cover multi-period lead time.\n- My target is to place enough order to bring visible inventory up to the OR-style base-stock \u2248155 units to protect against the high service-level implied by q=0.95. With on-hand 73 and no in-transit, that implies ordering about 82 units (155 \u2212 73 = 82).\n- I deviate slightly upward from OR's 79 to exactly hit the rounded base-stock target (minor difference of +3 units). This small increase reduces stockout risk (high profit per unit) while incurring minimal additional holding cost ($1/unit/period).\n- Risk checks: Demand is noisy, but across long history there is no sustained regime shift (no 3+ period sustained increase/decrease relative to historical mean) that would justify a more aggressive change.

(Carry-over already records this.)\n- Current inventory position: on-hand = 17, in-transit = 0. Because L=0, pipeline effectively equals on-hand for planning.\n- Demand outlook: Using the provided historical sample set (Period_1..5: 143,103,39,81,99) single-period mean \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 93 and sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 37.75.

OR capped the order and produced 135 (slightly different due to full-history stats and cap). \n- Decision rule applied: Because lead time is 0, an order placed now fills current-period demand; given recent high-demand realizations (P39,P40) and the base-stock target (~155), I prefer to reach the base-stock rather than accept a slightly lower OR suggestion. Holding cost is small ($1) relative to profit ($19), so the cost of a little extra inventory is small compared to lost sales. Therefore I place an order to bring inventory to the base-stock target: order \u2248 155 \u2212 17 \u2248 138 units.\n- Risk checks: This order is robust to demand volatility seen recently; if demand drops, extra inventory will incur low holding cost ($1/unit/period). If demand stays high, this level reduces stockout risk.\nFinal action: order 138 units (increases OR's 135 to 138 to match the computed base-stock target given confirmed L=0 and recent high demand).",

With lead time 0 an order placed now will arrive during this period and be available to satisfy current-period demand (arrivals will be visible in next period's conclude message).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand picture: On-hand = 59 units. Historical behavior and OR's capped base-stock approach typically targets a starting inventory near ~150 units to cover typical demand spikes (we've repeatedly seen starting inventories around 150 in prior periods and many single-period demands in the 80\u2013140 range). Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so the optimal fractile strongly favors stocking to avoid lost sales.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation and adjustment: OR recommends 93 units. That order plus current on-hand (59 + 93 = 152) restores the store to the typical ~150-level base-stock that has repeatedly matched realized demand patterns. Given (a) confirmed lead time = 0 so the order is immediately useful this period, (b) no in-transit stock, and (c) high profit vs. holding cost (q\u22480.95) I will accept OR's capped suggestion without modification.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final strategy: Place order = 93.

Recent demand has been elevated (5-period mean ~109.6) and lead time = 0, so I want to target the high service level implied by profit/holding. Ordering 155 raises on-hand+arrival to about 166 and aligns with the calculated base-stock (reduces risk of stockout during these high-demand periods). Holding cost is low relative to profit, so the upside of avoiding lost sales outweighs extra holding cost.\n\nFinal decision: Order 155 units of chips(Regular) now (arrives in Period 46), which gives roughly the base-stock level of \u2248166 including current on-hand 11.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded-history shows many arrivals with lead_time=0 (including Period1 and the recorded carry-over insight). So actual lead time is confirmed 0 periods; any order placed now will arrive within this same period's arrival resolution and be available to meet Period 48 demand (though arrival visibility to us will only show in Period 48 conclude). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 101, in-transit = 0. Use recent demand evidence: the historical sample set used by OR (and the longer history) indicates single-period mean demand roughly in the 80\u2013100 range (the 5-sample mean = 93 units; many recent single-period demands cluster around that). With expected single-period demand \u224893, our current on-hand (101) already covers expected Period 48 demand and leaves a small buffer (~8 units). There are only three periods remaining in the horizon (Periods 48\u201350), so ordering large quantities now would incur holding costs across multiple remaining periods and risk overstocking relative to remaining selling opportunities. OR recommended 53 units. OR uses its base-stock/cap logic and promised lead time; its recommendation would raise on-hand + arrivals by ~53 to provide heavier safety stock (likely to reach its base-stock level). Given confirmed lead time=0 and current on-hand > expected single-period demand, the marginal benefit of ordering 53 now is limited because we already have a good chance of selling this period's demand; additional units would mostly create extra holding cost across the remaining short horizon. Tradeoff: profit per unit sold ($19) greatly exceeds holding cost per period ($1), so stocking to meet real demand is valuable \u2014 but we are already sufficiently stocked for at least one period. Decision: do not follow OR's increment; place zero units. This avoids unnecessary holding cost given short remaining horizon and sufficient current inventory to meet near-term demand. Final strategy: order 0 units this period, monitor Period 48 conclude to confirm realized demand and arrival visibility; if demand in Period 48 is significantly higher than expected and ending inventory falls materially, we'll resume ordering in Period 49 given lead_time=0.",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Past concluded messages (including the recorded carry-over insight) confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive the same period they are placed). There are no in-transit units and the on-hand inventory at decision time is 26. Orders placed now will arrive during Period 49 and can be used to meet Period 49 demand; remaining inventory after Period 49 will carry into the final Period 50 and only final ending inventory is penalized by holding cost.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand outlook: The historical sample OR used (the five demand observations supplied: 143,103,39,81,99) yields mean \u03bc\u0304 = 93 units/period and sample std \u2248 37.8. With two periods remaining (Periods 49 and 50), expected total demand \u2248 2 \xd7 93 = 186 units. Variability over two periods is larger (\u03c3_total \u2248 sqrt(2)\xd737.8 \u2248 53.4), but because this is the penultimate period (only one period of carry-to-end after next demand), leftover stock at the game end is directly penalized ($1 per unsold unit). Profit per sold unit ($19) is much larger than the holding penalty ($1), so we should ensure we have enough inventory to meet expected remaining demand, but avoid large excess safety that would likely become final leftover.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR baseline comparison: OR recommends 127 units. OR\u2019s base-stock (using 1-period planning and the promised lead time) produced a single-period target; that is appropriate for steady replenishment but underestimates needs when two selling periods remain. On-hand (26) + OR order (127) \u2192 153 units available, which is noticeably below the two-period expected demand (186), risking lost sales in the final two periods and foregoing high profit per unit.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final decision logic and quantity: I target expected remaining demand (186) to avoid lost high-margin sales across the two remaining periods, and minimize unnecessary end-of-game leftover. Required order = expected total demand (186) \u2212 current on-hand (26) = 160 units. This choice balances capturing expected profitable sales (profit $19 each) against the small penalty for leftover ($1 each). Ordering ~160 should satisfy most likely demand across Periods 49\u201350 while avoiding excessive final inventory that would be penalized. I therefore increase OR\u2019s 127 to 160 units.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risks and notes: If actual demand is well below expectation, we may carry some ending inventory and incur a small holding penalty; if demand is substantially above expectation, we will still sell more (high profit). Because lead time = 0, this order will be available immediately to meet Period 49 demand.\n",
