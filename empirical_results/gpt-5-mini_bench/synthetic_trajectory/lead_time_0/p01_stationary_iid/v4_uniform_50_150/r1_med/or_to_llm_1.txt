There are currently no in-transit units and no evidence of lost shipments.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand was high: Period 1 demand = 134 (sold 123 due to stockout). Historical samples provided (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show volatility but two recent high values (~130). OR's base-stock/capped recommendation is 130 units, which aligns with the highest recent realized demands and the need to avoid another stockout this period.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR comparison and adjustment decision: OR assumes promised lead time and uses historical demand; here actual lead time matches promised (observed = 0). Given the immediate availability of same-period arrivals and the recent high demand (134), I will follow OR's recommendation of 130 units. This balances meeting expected demand this period while limiting holding costs (holding cost is $1 vs profit $4 so critical fractile is 0.8, implying moderate safety stock).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final strategy: Order 130 units now so they arrive during Period 2 and can satisfy Period 2 demand.

However, per instructions I will be conservative about writing a carry-over insight until I see 3+ periods of confirmed evidence.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 1, in-transit = 0. Realized demand in concluded periods: Period 1 demand = 134 (sold 123 due to stockout), Period 2 demand = 129 (sold 129). The simple recent average demand = (134 + 129) / 2 \u2248 131.5 units for a period. Profit = $4, holding = $1 implies critical fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84), which increases safety stock over the mean \u2014 consistent with OR's base-stock style recommendation.\n\nOR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 132 units. That aligns with the recent average demand (~132) and the z-adjusted base-stock computed by OR. With lead time effectively 0, an order placed now will arrive before demand is realized this period, so ordering to bring available inventory up to ~132 is appropriate to target the base-stock level and avoid stockouts.\n\nFinal strategy: Follow OR recommendation. With on-hand=1, ordering 132 units will give ~133 units available for Period 3 demand (order arrives same period), which matches the OR base-stock target and the recent realized demand pattern.

This is consistent for 3 consecutive periods, so actual lead time is now confirmed as 0 periods.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 54, in-transit = 0 (but with lead time 0, any new order will arrive within this same period's arrival resolution and be available to meet Period 4 demand). Historical demand samples provided (used by OR) produce an empirical mean \u224893.8 units per period (samples: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129). Recent realized demands from concluded periods: P1=134, P2=129, P3=79 \u2014 volatile but centered above the long-run mean for some periods. Because lead time is 0, we only need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand when setting order quantity.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation review: OR recommends 75 units based on its capped base-stock policy using the promised lead time and the full historical sample. OR's cap smooths large swings and aims for a high service level. Given our confirmed lead time of 0, OR's calculation using the same 1-period horizon is appropriate.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision trade-offs: Objective is Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory. Profit per sold unit is high ($4) relative to holding ($1) but holding cost is non-negligible. With on-hand 54, ordering OR's 75 yields total available \u2248129 units, which covers even the larger recent demands (~129\u2013134) while keeping excessive leftover inventory risk moderate. Ordering much more would increase holding costs without proportional gain in expected sales; ordering materially less risks missed sales and lost profit.\n\nFinal strategy: Follow the OR recommendation and order 75 units. Rationale: confirmed lead time 0 means the order will be available for Period 4 demand, and on-hand + 75 = 129 provides good coverage for observed demand volatility (including recent high draws of 129\u2013134) while avoiding unnecessary extra holding cost.\n\nHow this deviates from OR: It does not \u2014 I accept OR's capped base-stock recommendation because (a) lead time confirmation supports the OR horizon, (b) available on-hand + OR order gives good coverage of observed demand spikes, and (c) holding cost argues against larger safety padding.\n\nMonitoring plan: After Period 4 conclude, verify arrival and realized demand. If demand shows a sustained shift (3+ periods) or lead time changes, update policy and record as a carry-over insight.",

Recomputing the OR-style base-stock with confirmed L=0: \u03bc\u0302 = mean \u2248116.6, \u03c3\u0302 \u224823.2, critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 z*\u22480.842. base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248116.6 + 0.842\xd723.2 \u2248136.1.

Decision: I order 136 units (rounding to whole units) \u2014 slightly above OR's 132. Rationale for adjustment: recent realized demands have averaged \u2248117 with several high-demand periods (129,134,139) and material variability (std \u224823). With lead time confirmed 0 and holding cost low relative to profit, the risk-adjusted base-stock suggests a small upward adjustment to reduce stockout risk and capture profit. Operationally this order will arrive during this period and be available for sales after arrival (consistent with L=0). Carry-over insight: none new (lead time 0 was already recorded in prior carry-over insights).",

With lead time confirmed 0 and no evidence of lost shipments or a sustained regime shift (demand variability exists but no 3+ period consistent change), following OR is reasonable.

We have concluded-period demand history through Period 9: {P1:134, P2:129, P3:79, P4:105, P5:139, P6:96, P7:134, P8:125, P9:147}. Recent 3-period average (P7\u2013P9) = (134+125+147)/3 = 135.3, and 9-period average \u2248 120.9. OR baseline recommends 136 units using its capped base-stock method (which uses promised lead time and full history).\n\nLead-time inference & arrival risk: Concluded history shows orders consistently arriving same period (lead time = 0). There is no in-transit inventory and no evidence of lost shipments. With lead time = 0, any order placed will arrive in the same period and be available to meet demand that follows arrival; therefore we must cover only the current-period demand distribution (no pipeline coverage beyond current period).\n\nDemand outlook & safety: Recent periods (P7\u2013P9) show elevated demand relative to earlier low points (P3\u2013P4). The 3-period recent mean ~135 is close to OR's recommendation (136). Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, critical fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8, implying moderate safety stock; OR's computed cap already tempers large swings. Holding cost is non-negligible but smaller than profit, so slight overstocking to avoid lost sales is justified.\n\nDecision logic vs OR: OR's recommendation of 136 matches the recent observed demand regime (recent mean ~135) and appropriately accounts for uncertainty via its safety factor and cap. With lead time confirmed as 0 and no pipeline, there is minimal risk of late arrivals. Therefore I accept the OR recommendation without modification to balance expected sales and holding cost.\n\nFinal action: Order 136 units for chips(Regular) this period.

This brings on-hand + order to 135 units available this period, aligning with the computed base-stock (~137) and covering expected demand (~118) while providing safety stock to reduce stockouts.\n8) Carry-over insight: No new sustained patterns to record (lead time already recorded; demand variability present but not a sustained regime shift of 3+ periods beyond existing history).",

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1) Lead-time inference: Past concluded periods (P1\u2013P14) consistently show orders arriving the same period they were placed. Carry-over insight from Period 4 already recorded 'Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.' I treat actual lead time as 0 (arrivals same period as order).\n2) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so pipeline_inventory = 0. Because lead time = 0, we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand with this order.\n3) Demand analysis: Using the last 14 concluded demands (P1\u2013P14) the sample mean demand \u2248 119.5 units/period and sample std dev \u2248 22.36 units. This is the best recent estimate; no sustained regime shift or seasonality detected beyond normal variability.\n4) OR baseline: OR recommends 136 units. Recomputing the OR-style base-stock with current stats: \u03bc\u0302 = 119.5, \u03c3\u0302 = 22.36, critical z* for q=profit/(profit+holding)=4/5=0.8 is \u22480.842. base_stock \u2248 119.5 + 0.842\xd722.36 \u2248 138.3. The OR cap (~156) does not bind here, so uncapped base_stock\u2248138 is consistent with OR's 136 recommendation.\n5) Decision: I order 138 units (rounded to whole units). Rationale for adjustment: OR's 136 is close; slight increase to 138 brings inventory to the computed base-stock level (\u2248138.3) which balances expected one-period demand (~119.5) and safety stock for 80% critical fractile. Given lead time=0 and zero pipeline, ordering to target base stock for one period is appropriate. This keeps stockouts unlikely while limiting holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period).\n6) Risk checks: If actual demand falls substantially next periods or we observe lost shipments/lead-time drift, I will update orders. No new carry-over insight is recorded now since lead time=0 was already captured and no new sustained pattern (3+ periods) appears beyond normal variability.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Past concluded periods (Periods 1\u201315) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed; previous carry-over insight already records lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 16 and can be used to satisfy Period 16 demand. There are no in-transit units currently.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Use recent realized demand to estimate single-period demand. The most recent five realized demands (Periods 11\u201315) are: 101, 147, 106, 139, 73 \u2192 mean \u2248 113.2, sample standard deviation \u2248 30.1. This recent window captures the current demand regime better than the small earlier sample set.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 70 units. OR uses promised lead time and historical data; its capped base-stock advice is similar to my calculation but it does not incorporate the most recent volatility explicitly. With lead time = 0 and no pipeline, essentially we want order + on-hand to reach a near base-stock for one period.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory target and order calculation: For profit $4 and holding $1 the critical fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84). Base-stock \u2248 \u03bc + z\xb7\u03c3 \u2248 113.2 + 0.84\xb730.1 \u2248 138.5 units target on-hand for the period.

OR's 70 is slightly conservative; cap is likely similar but OR rounds to 70.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision and risk tradeoff: Holding cost is substantial relative to profit (1 vs 4), so I avoid a large upward deviation. I place an order of 74 units (rounding order_raw up to the nearest whole unit) to bring expected available inventory close to the base-stock target (65 + 74 = 139 \u2248 138.5). This balances service (avoid stockouts this period given mean \u2248113) against holding cost.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Carry-over & monitoring: No new sustained regime shift or lead-time change is confirmed (lead time = 0 already recorded).

Strategy/decision: Because lead time is 0, we can safely top up to cover one-period demand without building multi-period pipeline.

That means orders placed now arrive during the same period's arrival resolution and can satisfy current-period demand, so we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 = 1). Inventory snapshot: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand signal: I prioritize recent periods (last 5: Periods 15\u201319 demands = 73, 95, 126, 54, 142) which show a mean \u2248 98 and sample std \u2248 36.4.

Decision logic: OR's 135 is slightly above my recent-data base_stock (~129) because OR uses all historical data (higher older means). Given lead time = 0 we can respond next period if demand surges again; holding cost is non-trivial ($1/unit/period). To balance stockout risk from the recent 142 spike and holding cost, I place a small conservative adjustment to the recent-data base_stock and order 130 units (slightly above 129). This follows OR's intent but avoids building excess inventory relative to the most recent demand regime. Summary of risks: ordering 130 may still stock out if demand repeats >130 this period (e.g., 142) but over-ordering increases holding cost; with LT=0 we can correct next period quickly.

Since lead time = 0 is confirmed, we can react intra-period and do not need extra pipeline coverage for future periods. Recent demand has been volatile (periods 16\u201320 demands: 95, 126, 54, 142, 53) with occasional spikes above the mean, but these spikes are not a sustained regime shift. Decision and strategy: I will order 46 units (rounding order_raw to integer). This brings on-hand+arrival to about 123 units this period, matching the OR base-stock level and covering expected demand (mean \u2248 94) plus safety stock implied by z*\u22480.84, while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & visibility: Carry-over insight from Period 4 already confirmed actual lead time = 0. That means orders placed now can arrive during this same period and will affect current-period availability (but we only see confirmation in the conclude message afterwards). Pipeline = 0 and on-hand = 21. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 18\u201321) = [54, 142, 53, 102], mean \u2248 87.8, sample std \u2248 42.8. Longer-run early-sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) \u2248 93.8, so recent mean is slightly lower but variability is high. Because lead time = 0, we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 = 1).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 112 units using its capped base-stock. Using the recent mean (\u224887.8) and a service-derived safety factor (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 \u2192 z*\u22480.842), a conventional base-stock would be \u2248 87.8 + 0.842\xd742.8 \u2248 124 units (uncapped). With on-hand 21, that implies ordering ~103. OR's 112 is in the same neighborhood.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Adjustment decision and justification: I reduce OR's 112 \u2192 90 units. Reasons: (a) actual lead time = 0 and no in-transit inventory, so replenishment is immediate and we do not need to pre-build a large pipeline; (b) recent mean demand (~88) suggests a one-period target near 88, and with 21 on-hand we only need \u224867 to meet mean demand \u2014 I add a modest buffer for variability but avoid the larger safety stock that drives OR's higher order given its blind use of all history and its cap; (c) holding cost is non-negligible ($1/unit/period) relative to profit $4, so reducing overstock reduces holding penalties while still leaving reasonable coverage for demand spikes. Ordering 90 yields on-hand + arrival = 111 units available this period \u2014 higher than the recent mean (\u224888) and provides a cushion for high-demand draws without tying up excessive inventory.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risks and monitoring: Because demand is volatile (std \u2248 43), there's a real chance of large spikes (e.g., 142). If we see another high spike or sustained higher average over 3+ periods, I will increase future orders toward OR's level or above. Conversely, if several periods show low demand, I will trim orders further. Continue to use concluded-period messages to reconfirm lead time (already confirmed) and to detect any lost shipments.\n\nFinal action: order 90 units for chips(Regular).",

Looking across the full history, demand frequently swings above and below 100; however OR's baseline (which uses all history and promised lead time) recommends 135 units. Given profit $4 and holding $1, the OR critical fractile (0.8) encourages stocking above the mean to avoid lost sales, but the recent realized mean (\u2248100) is lower than OR's 135 recommendation.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory & risk trade-off: With lead_time=0 we can safely order to meet expected single-period demand; ordering excess immediately increases holding cost by $1/unit this period but prevents lost sales that cost $4/unit. Because demand has recently been lower than OR's recommendation, and there is no in-transit buffer, I reduce the OR recommendation slightly to avoid unnecessary holding cost while keeping a healthy buffer against upside demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final action: I choose 130 units (OR recommended 135).

Recent realized demand has been elevated compared with the very early periods. Using the most recent 5 periods (Periods 20\u201324) demands = {53, 102, 147, 138, 79} -> average \u2248 103.8 units for a single period; this is the best short-term forecast because it reflects the current regime. With confirmed lead time 0, we need to cover only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Holding cost is nontrivial ($1/unit/period) so over-ordering is costly; stockouts also lose profit (profit = $4/unit). The OR recommendation of 78 units appears to be based on longer-history statistics and the promised lead time, and is higher than the gap between our on-hand and the current-period demand expectation.\n\nOrder calculation and strategy: Target single-period demand \u2248 104.

Given the confirmed zero lead time and absence of in-transit inventory, ordering 47 units is the efficient, conservative choice versus following OR's larger capped recommendation of 78. We accept some risk of stockout if demand spikes above the recent average; however, frequent past spikes are intermittent and holding cost makes large safety stock expensive.

  "rationale": "Step 1 - Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201329) confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). There are no in-transit units and on-hand = 0, so any order placed now will arrive in time to meet Period 30 demand.\n\nStep 2 - Demand assessment: Using the 29 concluded demand observations (Periods 1\u201329) the sample mean demand \u2248 113 units/period (sum=3283, n=29). Demand fluctuates but centers around ~110\u2013130 with occasional dips (~50s) and spikes (~140s). Empirical variability suggests a one-period \u03c3 on the order of ~25\u201335; that variability explains why the OR baseline produced a higher recommendation than the plain mean.\n\nStep 3 - OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 135 units. Given profit= $4 and holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8 (z*\u22480.84). If \u03c3\u224830 then base_stock \u2248 113 + 0.84\xd730 \u2248 138, which is close to OR's 135. OR used promised L=0 (same as observed), historical samples, and a cap; its result is consistent with our observed mean and reasonable safety stock.\n\nStep 4 - Inventory risk: On-hand=0 and no pipeline, so ordering less than the recommended level risks stockout and lost sales this period. Holding cost is moderate ($1/unit/period) but profit per unit is higher ($4), so bias toward filling demand rather than cutting order to save holding cost.\n\nDecision: Follow OR recommendation and order 135 units. Rationale: confirmed lead time 0 (order will arrive same period), observed mean demand \u2248113 and variability justifies safety stock; OR's 135 aligns with base-stock math (\u03bc + z\u03c3).

That means an order placed in Period 35 will arrive during Period 35 and can be used to meet Period 35 demand. There is no in-transit inventory to consider (in-transit = 0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Recent demand assessment: Recent five-period demands (Periods 30\u201334) were: 77, 141, 133, 105, 74. The 5-period average = 106 units with noticeable volatility and several large spikes (141,133). Historical long-run behavior across many periods also shows frequent demands around 100\u2013140, so the expected demand for the immediate period is nearer to ~100+ rather than the low 70s.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation context: OR recommends 73 units using promised lead time and its capped base-stock logic. That recommendation is conservative relative to recent realized demand (mean \u2248106) and does not account for the observed high variance and confirmed zero lead time that allows same-period replenishment.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Profit/holding tradeoff: Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1. Critical fractile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 favor stocking to avoid lost sales. Given the high cost of lost sales relative to modest holding cost, it is prudent to err slightly on the side of having extra on-hand.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final ordering decision: On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0. I order 75 units so arrival this period yields available inventory = 61 + 75 = 136 units. That covers a high-demand realized spike (up to ~140 historically) and gives a buffer against variability while limiting excessive holding cost.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk and monitoring: This increases the OR recommendation slightly (+2 units) to reflect recent higher average demand and volatility while not drastically overstocking.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 53, in-transit = 0. Use historical demand (full history plus the five-sample summary) and recent periods to estimate single-period demand. The five-sample statistics (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) give mean \u2248 93.8 and sample std \u2248 34.5. Using the OR-style critical fractile (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.842) implies a base-stock \u2248 93.8 + 0.842\xd734.5 \u2248 123 units. That base-stock is a reasonable target because recent periods (Periods 31\u201335 demands = 141, 133, 105, 74, 83; recent average \u2248 107) support a required availability in the 100\u2013130 range to avoid stockouts given demand variability. OR recommended 81 units (uses its own long-history calculation). Adjustment logic: Because lead time is 0, ordered units are available immediately this period, so the practical objective is to bring available inventory (on-hand + order) near the data-driven base-stock \u2248 123. With 53 on-hand, that implies ordering \u2248 70 units. Action: order 70 units. Risk tradeoffs: This increases availability to ~123 to reduce lost sales (high profit per unit $4) at the expense of holding cost $1/unit; the safety stock reflects moderate demand variability.

Therefore orders placed now will arrive within this period and can satisfy Period 37 demand. No in-transit inventory exists and on-hand = 0. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand & inventory assessment: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 32\u201336) = {133, 105, 74, 83, 133}; recent 5-period mean \u2248 105.6 with visible volatility (sd driven by values near 70\u2013133). Longer-run behavior in history centers around roughly 120\u2013135 many periods. Current exposure: on-hand 0, so we must order to cover this period's demand and maintain buffer given variability. \n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation and interpretation: OR recommends 134 units using its capped base-stock policy (it uses promised L=0 and historical samples). That recommendation already builds a safety buffer (critical fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8 \u21d2 z\u22480.84) and a cap to limit extreme swings. Given lead time = 0 (so orders are effective immediately), the OR quantity is appropriate to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost. \n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision & justification: I will follow the OR recommendation and order 134 units. Rationale: on-hand = 0 so we need inventory this period; lead time = 0 means the order directly covers Period 37 demand; OR's 134 aligns with longer-run demand peaks seen in the history and provides safety against the observed variability. The holding cost ($1/unit/period) is moderate relative to profit ($4/unit), so maintaining this safety stock is cost-effective versus risking lost sales. \n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk notes: If we observe several consecutive low-demand periods (3+ periods) we will consider lowering the base-stock; conversely if demand spikes above this level repeatedly we will increase orders.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 35, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand is around ~100 units per period (examples: P33=105, P34=74, P35=83, P36=133, P37=99), with frequent historical replenishment volumes clustering near 130\u2013136 units when pipeline was low. Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1 -> critical fractile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 implying a meaningful safety stock (OR computed a recommendation of 99 units using its base-stock cap). Decision logic and final strategy: Because actual lead time = 0, an order will immediately augment the 35 on-hand. To target an available inventory level consistent with historical patterns and expected next-period demand (~100) plus safety stock, I increase OR's recommendation of 99 to a round 100 units. That will yield on-hand + arrival \u2248 135 units this period (35 + 100), matching the typical starting inventories that avoided frequent stockouts in the past and reflecting the relatively high profit / moderate holding cost tradeoff. I do not lower the order: demand remains volatile and often exceeds 100, and lost shipments are not observed.

There are no in-transit units and arrivals occur immediately when ordered, so any order placed now will arrive during Period 48 and be available for Period 48 demand.\n\n2) Inventory position and requirement: On-hand = 70, In-transit = 0. With L = 0, we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand (current period demand happens after decision). So target coverage = expected next-period demand.\n\n3) Demand outlook: Inspecting recent realized demand (Periods 43-47 = 113, 56, 98, 109, 53) gives a recent 5-period average \u2248 85.8 \u2248 86 units. This recent average is a better anchor than older long-run samples because demand shows volatility and recent periods include several low values (56, 53). No strong calendar/seasonal signals or multi-period regime shift detected that would justify large added safety stock.\n\n4) OR recommendation: OR suggests 64 units (based on its capped base-stock using promised lead time and longer historical samples). Following OR would raise inventory to 134 units (70 on-hand + 64 arriving), which is likely excessive relative to one-period expected demand (~86) and would incur avoidable holding cost ($1 per unit per period).\n\n5) Decision math: Expected demand \u2248 86. Required additional units = max(0, expected_demand - on-hand) = max(0, 86 - 70) = 16 units. With lead time 0 this order arrives immediately and covers the current-period demand shortfall. Ordering more would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit is $4/unit \u2014 but since we only need to cover one period and no evidence of upcoming spike, minimal order is preferred.\n\n6) Risk & conservative adjustment: Because demand is volatile, one could add a small safety buffer. However OR's cap-to-base approach already recommended a much larger uplift; given frequent immediate arrivals (L=0) we can react quickly next period if demand is higher. Therefore I order the computed shortfall of 16 units rather than following OR's larger qty.\n\nFinal action: Order 16 units of chips(Regular).\n\n7) Carry-over insight: No new sustained pattern meets the 3+ period significance threshold, so none recorded.",

Current period is 49; orders placed now will arrive during Period 49 and can be used to satisfy Period 49 demand. There is one more decision opportunity (Period 50) before the horizon ends, so I should only order to cover expected demand in Period 49 (no need to pre-stock for Period 50). Inventory position: on-hand = 2, in-transit = 0. OR recommendation = 131 units (base-stock capped policy using long-run demand). Why I deviate from OR: OR uses all historical samples and promised lead time only; it targets a multi-period safety stock and is thus high (131). Given confirmed lead time = 0 and that we have another opportunity to order in Period 50, ordering to cover only expected single-period demand is preferable to avoid paying holding cost on leftover inventory at the end of the horizon. Demand signal: recent realized demands (Periods 44\u201348) = [56, 98, 109, 53, 84]; simple average of these five most recent periods = 80 units. This recent window shows a lower demand regime than the longer-run OR baseline. Because the environment is late in the horizon and we have a confirmed same-period lead time, I target the recent single-period expected demand rather than OR's larger multi-period base-stock.

Risk notes: If demand in Period 49 spikes above 80, we will stockout and lose potential profit; however the profit per unit ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) and the proximity to the horizon make avoiding leftover inventory (which would be penalized at period end) more important.
