Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show values: [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]; sample mean \u2248 91 and moderate variability. Promised lead time is 0. Profit per unit ($4) is high relative to holding cost ($1), implying a high target service level. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence available yet, and no sustained demand regime change (only 5 mixed samples). I therefore use the default lead time (promised L=0) because there is no observed lead-time data to contradict it. For demand parameters I use the defaults so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full sample set for initial base-stock setting while the high profit/holding ratio will drive a high service-level quantile in the OR engine. No shipments are overdue and no carry-over insight to record.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 context: On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Period_1 conclude shows an order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 (arrived=118, lead_time=0). Recent observed demand (Period_1) was 62 units, while the historical sample mean across provided data (Periods 1-5) is 91 units. Promised lead time is 0 and the single observed lead-time sample also equals 0, so I use the calculated lead time to confirm expected same-period arrivals. To be conservative and leverage the full demand history (no clear sustained regime shift), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to the backend defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (using the full-sample higher mean of 91 units) against holding cost given current on-hand of 56 and no in-transit units. If shipments begin to miss their promised lead time in future concludes, I will switch to an explicit or recent_N lead-time and record a carry-over insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. History shows two concluded arrivals: orders placed in Period_1 and Period_2 both arrived with lead_time=0, so actual lead time appears to be 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded sales history showed large variability but the canonical demand sample set (used by forecasting) has mean \u224891 units/period. Promised lead time is 0; I choose to let the backend calculate L as the average of observed lead times (method: calculate) to confirm observed lead time=0. For demand I use default methods: mu_hat default => (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples (captures full-period demand given L=0) and sigma_hat default => sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples (captures observed demand volatility). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies relatively high critical ratio) against holding cost while reflecting confirmed same-period arrivals. No explicit inflation of mean or variance is made because we have only two concluded lead-time observations and the sample demand series already encodes recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived in the same period (lead_time=0 each), so actual lead time appears to be 0. On-hand = 55, in-transit = 0; demand history shows high variability (samples include a large spike in Period_2) but overall historical mean (~91) and profit/holding (profit $4 > holding $1) justify targeting service rather than aggressive inventory cuts. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (average of observed lead times = 0). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I choose the default methods so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level with holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time and the volatile demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Date: Period_5. Current on-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time confirmed as 0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). Recent demand samples provided: [105, 36, 108, 110, 96], mean = 91.0. With confirmed lead time = 0 and no outstanding pipeline, I use the default lead-time and demand aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock using the full-sample mean and std. This keeps the policy simple and leverages the observed zero lead time (so no additional pipeline coverage). Using defaults balances service level (meeting next-period demand) against holding cost given modest demand variability and current healthy on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: Recent conclude messages (Periods 1\u20135) consistently show orders arriving same period they were placed; prior carry-over already confirmed actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand = 58, in-transit = 0, so there are no pending arrivals to rely on for Period 6 demand. Historical demand samples (environment snapshot) average 91 units/period; with promised lead time 0 this implies a one-period forecast of ~91 units. Profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) implies a high critical ratio (0.8) so the OR backend should target a relatively high service level. I therefore retain the confirmed lead time (use default promised L), and use the full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available samples. This balances the need for high fill rates (given high profit) against holding costs, while remaining conservative because there is no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (P1-P6) = [62,161,76,60,64,111]. Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 0 periods. No shipments are currently overdue or in-transit, so use promised lead time. Demand shows recent volatility with a large spike in Period 2 and another spike in Period 6; to respond to the most relevant recent pattern I base the forecast on the last 3 realized demands (Periods 4-6 = 60, 64, 111). Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the current regime so orders cover the near-term (L+1) demand including the recent uptick, while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability. L uses default (promised 0) since concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) versus holding cost by not over-weighting older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. Current on-hand=38, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed=0), matching the recorded carry-over insight. Demand in recent periods remains variable with occasional spikes (Period_6 demand=111, Period_2 demand=161) but the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 3-7 = 76, 60, 64, 111, 65) give a recent average = 75.2 units and recent std \u2248 18.7. I choose L=default to retain promised lead time 0 (confirmed by past arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the most recent regime (captures recent spike activity) and keeps the base-stock responsive without overreacting to older samples. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so the safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices balance service (respond to recent demand level ~75 units for the review+lead period) against holding cost (holding $1/unit); using only the most recent 5 periods avoids diluting the estimate with much older data while keeping cap/safety calculations conservative given observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20138) shows frequent same-period arrivals and the game-provided carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no arrivals are expected this period. Demand history from concluded periods: [62,161,76,60,64,111,65,123] indicates high variability but no sustained regime shift in mean/variance over the last 8 periods. Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded arrivals consistently matched promises, so I keep L at default (promised). To let the OR backend use all available demand history for a stable estimate and to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat which compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This yields a base-stock reflecting overall mean demand and its volatility; with lead time 0 this targets same-period service while avoiding excessive holding given the holding cost. No overdue or lost shipments detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 start. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P9) shows every order arriving same period it was placed (lead_time observed = 0 each concluded period). Current on-hand = 15, in-transit = 0, so no arrivals expected this period. Demand history (concluded demands P5\u2013P9 = 64,111,65,123,104) shows elevated and variable demand relative to earlier tiny sample set; I treat the last 5 periods as the most relevant regime. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead time average (captures confirmed 0 lead time). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent stable regime and keep orders responsive to recent demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than long-ago samples. These choices keep the OR backend\u2019s base-stock tuned to current realized lead time and recent demand patterns, balancing service level (by using recent mean + volatility) against holding cost (by not over-weighting older high or low outliers).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_11. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) shows consistent same-period arrivals: every concluded message reports arrived units with lead_time 0. On-hand = 26, in-transit = 0. Demand history (concluded) for Periods 1\u201310: [62,161,76,60,64,111,65,123,104,91]. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by past concluded arrivals, so use the backend default lead time. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples respectively. This leverages the full sample set to produce a stable base-stock target given confirmed zero lead time, balancing service level (via the backend's z* calculation using profit $4 and holding $1) against holding costs. Given on-hand=26 and no in-transit inventory, the backend will compute the order needed to reach the base stock while capping order size appropriately.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: confirmed short lead time environment (promised 0, historical concludes show consistent 0). Recent realized demand has risen relative to the very early samples\u2014last 5 concluded-period demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 65,123,104,91,68) show a higher and more variable regime (mean \u224890.2, std \u224824.5). Current on-hand = 50, in-transit = 0; with L=0 we must cover this period's demand after decision. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concludes consistently confirm same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent demand regime (captures the last 5 demand observations, N=5 is within the rule bounds). This raises the forecast (1+L)\xd7mean to reflect the recent higher demand and uses the recent volatility for safety. These parameters bias the OR backend toward a higher base stock to avoid stockouts observed in recent high-demand periods, while sigma based on recent variability avoids excessive holding by not overstating uncertainty.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=23, in-transit=0, no arrivals visible. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201312) shows variable but stable daily demand with no sustained regime shift. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 so target service level will be moderate. I select L via 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded arrivals. I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples \u2014 this yields a base-stock that covers the current period's demand while accounting for observed variability and the profit/holding tradeoff. This setup avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations and ensures orders cover (L+1)=1 period of demand given no in-transit stock.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (Period 1\u201313 concludes: all orders arrived with lead_time=0), so actual lead time = 0 is confirmed. Current on-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed. Demand history (concluded periods) shows variable demand but no sustained upward regime in the last 3+ periods that would justify deviating from the long-run estimate. Given profit=4 and holding=1 (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), use the default pipeline-based baseline: let the OR engine compute L from the promised lead time and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all available samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This is conservative: it leverages confirmed lead-time=0, uses full-sample demand statistics to balance service level and holding cost, and avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise when on-hand is low but arrivals are reliable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision: recent history (Periods 1\u201314 conclude) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 each concluded period) and variable demand with average \u224894.2 units/period and sample std \u224831.6. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover expected current-period demand plus safety stock. Given the confirmed and sustained lead-time=0 signal in concluded history, I set L using 'calculate' so the backend computes the observed average lead time (will be 0). For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to leverage the full demand history (14 samples) because no recent, sustained regime change in demand is evident\u2014there are spikes but not a 3+ period sustained shift. This balances service level (profit > holding cost, so target quantile is high) with holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and capped order using the full-sample estimates and observed lead time. Using defaults avoids overreacting to recent spikes while ensuring enough inventory now (on-hand=0) to meet expected demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Current on-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed previously). Recent sold/demand levels average around ~90\u2013110 units/period; no sustained regime change of 3+ periods detected beyond normal variation. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no strong changepoint, use default estimators so the OR backend leverages full-sample statistics. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 high target fill) with holding cost by letting backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*\xb7\u03c3 using all samples. Default L keeps promised lead time (0), default mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples, and default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This approach is conservative but appropriate: on-hand + pipeline (21) is low relative to typical period demand (~90\u2013110), so backend will order toward the computed base stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has increased and become more volatile (last five demands: 88, 106, 140, 99, 227; mean=132, large spike at Period_16). Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded history (up to Period_16) consistently shows 0-period arrivals, so I keep L as default (promised 0). Because demand appears to have shifted upward with high variance recently, I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (captures the most recent regime including the large spike). This yields (1+L)\xd7mean based on the last 5 periods to raise the base stock toward recent demand while sigma_hat from the same 5 samples captures elevated volatility. These choices prompt the OR backend to raise the replenishment target to preserve service during the recent high-demand regime, while the backend's cap still limits extreme over-ordering to control holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show orders arriving the same period (lead_time observed = 0 each concluded arrival). No overdue or missing shipments in the concluded history. Demand context: recent periods show some large spikes (e.g., Period 16 demand=227, Period 17 demand=186) but overall historical seed samples and concluded history support using the default demand estimate. To keep the OR backend aligned with the promised lead time and the long-run demand statistics, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This keeps base-stock calculation stable (uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) while the backend's cap will limit extreme ordering. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, default estimates avoid overreacting to short-lived spikes and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods including recent ones). Recent demand (Periods 16-18 = 227,186,210) is substantially higher than earlier periods, indicating a sustained upward regime starting at Period 16. To ensure service while avoiding excessive holding, I set lead time to default (use promised lead time = 0 since concluded history confirms 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (will weight the last 5 observed demands, which include the surge). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute a base stock that increases safety stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind via the backend's q-based z*. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during the confirmed demand surge) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand for Periods 16-18 = 207.67 vs avg for Periods 11-15 = 100.20 (+107%); sustained high demand observed for 3+ periods starting Period 16.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period 4 insight). Demand has a sustained, higher regime starting Period 16 (Periods 16-19 demands = 227,186,210,171). To target the current elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set lead time to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (covering Periods 16-19) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 4 demands). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect the variability in the new regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher mean demand and uses recent variance to size safety stock\u2014balancing service (profit per unit = $4) versus $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $825.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: confirmed lead time = 0 from earlier concludes; recent demand regime shift beginning Period 16 persists (Periods 16-20 show sustained higher demand). Current on-hand = 11, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low relative to the recent high-demand regime (recent demands: P16=227, P17=186, P18=210, P19=171, P20=209). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history consistently shows same-period arrivals. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16-20) rather than diluting the estimate with older low-demand data. I apply the same recent_N=5 for sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes safety stock to reflect the higher volatility observed since the regime shift. These choices push the backend toward a higher base stock that better covers (1+L) periods of demand under the new regime, improving service (more units sold) while accepting higher holding cost \u2014 appropriate given profit/holding tradeoff (profit = $4, holding = $1).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 context: recent demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 16 (sustained through Period 21). Current on-hand=33, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient vs recent demand. Promised lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so I keep L at the default (promised) to let the OR engine assume same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I focus on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201321). Recent 6-period mean demand = 1190/6 \u2248 198.33 units; with L=0 that gives mu_hat \u2248 198.3. I therefore select recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent high-demand samples. This biases orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while avoiding excessive long-tail safety stock from older low-demand periods. Given profit $4 vs holding $1 (q=0.8), the backend will place a relatively high base stock to protect service during this higher regime; using recent data avoids overstating variability from earlier low-demand periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 decision. Observations: on-hand=43, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals show lead time=0 consistently (confirmed earlier at Period 4 and every concluded period through Period 22). Demand regime: a sustained high-demand regime began at Period 16 (Periods 16-22 show elevated demand vs earlier periods). To reflect the sustained higher demand, I use recent_N=7 for demand forecast (Periods 16-22) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples \u2014 this targets the current regime rather than diluting with older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=7 to capture current volatility. Choosing L=default (promised lead time=0) is justified by repeated confirmed 0-period actual lead time. These parameters push the OR engine to hold more stock to meet the sustained high demand while the capped policy limits extreme orders; this balances the $4 profit per unit (favoring service) against $1 holding cost (penalizing excess).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 decision with confirmed lead time = 0 (historical arrivals always same-period). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period_16 and remained high through Period_23. Current inventory: on-hand=8, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no cover for next-period demand. I detect a sustained higher-demand regime from Period_16\u2013Period_23 (8 periods). Mean demand over Periods 16\u201323 = 196 units/period (sum=1568, n=8). Sample std over same window \u2248 18.5. Because the higher-demand regime is sustained (8 periods) I use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to ensure the OR engine targets the elevated demand and reduces stockout risk. I choose N=8 (regime length) per the changepoint rule. Using L=default (promised 0) keeps arrivals same-period as historically observed. These parameters bias the base-stock upward to prioritize avoiding lost sales in the new high-demand regime while holding cost is moderate (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 service-level emphasis).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 context: confirmed lead time has been 0 historically (Periods 1-24 concluded arrivals all same-period). Recent demand regime shift starting Period 16 produced sustained higher demand (Periods 16-24 average \u2248 191.8). Current on-hand = 55, in-transit = 0; promised L=0 means the OR engine will size orders to cover the next (1) period of demand in its base-stock calculation. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using the last 9 periods (Periods 16-24) where the high-demand regime is present (regime length=9). This keeps the forecast anchored to the confirmed higher demand and raises both target stock and safety stock accordingly while preserving the correct short lead-time assumption. Using default lead time (promised=0) is appropriate because concluded history shows consistent 0 lead time. The chosen parameters help the OR backend increase service-level (reduce stockouts) during the higher-demand regime while the holding cost ($1) is moderate relative to profit ($4), so we're prioritizing service with a recent-data based mean and volatility estimate.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (Periods 16-25 show consistently elevated demand vs earlier periods). Current on-hand = 27, in-transit = 0; with lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Given the clear regime shift (sustained high demand for 10 periods from P16\u2013P25), I bias forecasts toward the recent regime to avoid stockouts. Therefore: keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, supported by multiple concluded arrivals). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 10 periods (captures the new higher mean). Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This raises target base stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma from recent data prevents overstocking by reflecting current variability.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 decision. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_16 (Periods 16-26 all show elevated demand averaging well above early-period levels). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of demand. All concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 historically, so I use the default promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 16-26 inclusive, length=11). This uses the most relevant mean and volatility for the (1+L)-period forecast, increasing service level to avoid lost sales in this new higher-demand regime while sigma_hat with recent data limits excess safety stock growth. Using recent samples balances profit (high stock to capture sales) against holding cost by tailoring both mean and variability to the observed sustained demand shift.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_16 (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand=12, in-transit=0 so coverage is currently very low vs. recent demand (~~200 units). Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 (confirmed earlier), so I keep L as default (use promised 0). To align the OR backend with the sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 12 periods (Periods 16\u201327) which represent the current regime (regime length = 12). This focuses the base-stock calculation on the elevated mean and variability rather than diluting with lower historical demand. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, the backend will compute a high target service quantile; using recent demand statistics reduces stockouts in this sustained high-demand period while keeping holding cost sensitivity intact. No overdue arrivals or lost shipments are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $688.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 context: on-hand=32, in-transit=0, profit=$4/unit, holding=$1/unit/period. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed earlier at Period 4 and every conclude through Period_28). A sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_16 (noted in carry-over) produced materially higher demand levels from Period_16 onward. To protect service and reduce lost sales in this higher-demand regime, I keep L at the promised/confirmed value (0) and set demand estimates using recent data from the high-demand regime. I select mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 16\u201328) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of these most relevant samples and raises the base-stock to match the new regime. I also select sigma_hat recent_N with N=13 so safety stock reflects the observed volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts in the sustained high-demand regime while the holding cost ($1) remains moderate relative to profit ($4), letting the OR backend balance service level (through a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent high demand) against holding costs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (confirmed earlier). Demand regime shifted upward starting Period 16 and has persisted through Period 29 (sustained high demand). Given profit $4 vs holding $1 (q\u22480.8 \u2192 high service target), we must size the review+lead demand forecast to reflect the elevated regime to avoid stockouts. Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed by concluded history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201329, regime length = 14) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent samples. This raises both the forecast and safety stock to reduce lost sales while the OR engine's cap prevents extreme over-ordering, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (confirmed in Period 4 and every concluded period through Period 30). Demand shifted to a higher regime starting Period 16 and has persisted: recent demands (Periods 16-30) are elevated (~206 avg) vs the earlier baseline. Last 15 concluded demand observations (Periods 16-30) form a stable high-demand regime; I use this recent regime to set demand forecast and volatility. Therefore: keep L at default (promised 0, historically confirmed), set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to capture the sustained elevated mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last N samples), and set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the sustained high regime) against holding costs by anchoring forecasts to the confirmed new demand level rather than the older low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 context: on-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 repeatedly), and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16 (previously recorded). Recent realized demands (Periods 16\u201331) are substantially higher than pre-Period-16 levels, so I bias the demand forecast to the recent high-demand regime. Lead time selection: use the promised lead time (default) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period actual lead time; no evidence of lost shipments. mu_hat choice: recent_N with N=16 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201331 inclusive). This sets (1+L)\xd7mean using the most relevant data rather than diluting with older low-demand samples. sigma_hat choice: recent_N with N=16 to reflect volatility in the current regime and ensure safety stock matches recent variability. How this balances service vs holding cost: using recent demand statistics raises the base-stock to cover the materially higher average demand and observed variability, reducing stockouts (protecting profit margin $4/unit) while keeping holding exposure constrained by using only the recent regime (avoiding overstock from including older low-demand history). Given holding cost is $1/unit/period, using recent_N for both mean and volatility keeps the OR backend\u2019s z and cap calculations responsive to the current high-demand environment without overcommitting inventory far beyond expected demand.

A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 16 (Periods 16-32 exhibit consistently higher demand vs Periods 1-15). To reflect the new high-demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201332, length=17) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of those 17 samples. I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=17 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize meeting higher demand (reduce stockouts) while letting the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost using the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 context: on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (documented in carry-over). Recent realized demands from Periods 16\u201333 remain elevated vs pre-16. Because lead time is reliably 0, orders arrive same period and there is no pipeline to cover demand \u2014 we must keep on-hand inventory sufficient to meet the current higher-demand regime. I select L='default' to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded messages consistently confirm 0. For demand quantity I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 16\u201333 = 18 periods in the post-change high-demand regime) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 18 samples) and biases target stock toward the sustained higher mean. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=18 so safety stock reflects variability in the current regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost by only reacting to the confirmed, sustained regime rather than older low-demand data. Noting on-hand=44 and no in-transit, the backend will order up to the base stock computed from the recent high-demand mean and volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time remains 0 (confirmed repeatedly through Period 34). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 16 and has stayed elevated (~200+); regime length = 19 periods (Periods 16\u201334). Given zero pipeline and sustained higher demand, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0. For forecasting I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime to capture the new mean/volatility while giving the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast: mu_hat -> recent_N with N=19 to reflect average demand across the last 19 periods (the sustained high-demand regime). sigma_hat -> recent_N with N=19 to capture the volatility in the same window. These choices ensure the backend targets a base stock sized to the elevated demand level (reducing stockouts) while sigma is estimated from the current regime so safety stock is appropriate given holding cost tradeoff (profit=$4 vs holding=$1).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Profit/holding = $4/$1 implies service emphasis but holding cost matters. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier) so keep L as promised/default. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period_16 (higher mean from P16 onward) and this high-demand regime persists through Period_35. To let the OR engine target the current high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime. The regime length from Period_16\u2013Period_35 is 20 periods, so use N=20 to capture the high-demand mean/variance. These choices (L=default, mu_hat recent_N N=20, sigma_hat recent_N N=20) instruct the backend to size base stock for the higher current mean and its volatility while still using the promised lead time of 0, balancing service level against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across many periods) and a sustained higher demand regime starting Period 16 that has persisted through Period 36. Profit per unit ($4) vs holding ($1) implies a high critical fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 so the OR backend should target a relatively high service level. Given zero on-hand and pipeline, we need orders that cover current-period demand (since arrivals happen during the period) plus the backend's computed pipeline. I therefore keep lead time = default (promised = 0) because concluded arrival history consistently confirms 0; I ask the backend to use default demand and volatility calculations over all samples so it leverages the full history (including the sustained higher-demand regime) when computing base_stock and the capped order. This balances a high service level (to capture profit) against holding costs while respecting the observed reliable 0 lead time and the persistent elevated demand pattern.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 with much higher demand (~200s) that persists through recent periods. There are no overdue or missing shipments to account for. Given confirmed lead time = 0, I keep L = default (promised lead time). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length since P16 is >20; using 20 gives a stable estimate weighted to the current high-demand periods). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility in the high-demand regime. This approach ensures the OR engine builds a base stock sized to the recent high mean demand (avoiding stockouts) while sigma based on recent volatility prevents excessive safety stock that would increase holding costs unnecessarily. With profit $4 and holding $1 (service level target q\u22480.8), these parameters steer the backend to a relatively high service level appropriate for the current sustained demand environment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: on-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple arrivals same period as orders). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 16 (carry-over insight: avg Periods 16-18 >> prior). Since the high-demand regime has persisted for many periods (Periods 16\u201338) I bias forecasts toward the recent regime rather than the full-sample mean. Decision: keep L at promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. For demand level (mu_hat) use recent_N to capture the sustained higher mean; detect regime length from Period 16 onward (regime_length > 20) so choose N=20 (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 20 samples). For sigma_hat also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma based on recent data avoids underestimating uncertainty; keeping L=default avoids inflating safety stock from a nonexistent lead-time risk. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by limiting the horizon to recent observations rather than the entire history.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent through many periods). Demand regime shifted up starting Period_16 and has remained high; recent realized demands (Periods 20-39) average ~210 with elevated volatility. Given confirmed 0 lead time, use default L to keep backend aligned with supplier promise. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the estimate on the sustained high-demand regime (regime length since Period_16 \u2248 24 periods; per rule N = min(regime_length,20) = 20). This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand and increases sigma_hat to reflect recent variability, which together produce a higher base-stock and safety stock: improving service level (reduce stockouts under high demand) while the backend's capped order will limit extreme over-ordering to control holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: on-hand=5, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1-40) consistently show arrivals in the same period, so actual lead time remains confirmed as 0. Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (per prior insight), so overall sample mean reflects that higher level. No shipments are overdue (in-transit=0). To balance service level (high profit $4 vs holding $1) with holding cost, I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and variance: L="default" (use promised 0), mu_hat="default" so (1+L)*mean(all samples) captures the sustained higher demand, and sigma_hat="default" so sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) captures historical volatility. This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time and uses the full demand history (including the sustained higher regime) to set safety stock proportionally to profit vs holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0 (carry-over). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (carry-over insight). Recent realized demands (Periods 16-41) are substantially higher than pre-16. Given the sustained high-regime and zero pipeline, I want the OR engine to target safety and coverage for the high-demand regime. Choices: L=default to keep promised lead time (concluded history supports 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 (capture the most recent 20 periods within the high-demand regime: using a 20-sample window balances responsiveness and statistical stability). I apply the same recent_N, N=20 for sigma_hat so the engine computes volatility from the same recent high-demand window. This increases the base_stock and cap relative to using all-history averages, reducing stockouts during the sustained high-demand period while accepting higher holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$4, so the backend will compute service-level appropriately). With on-hand and in-transit = 0, these parameters prompt the engine to replenish to a base-stock appropriate for the current high-demand regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 decision. Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period_16 (previously recorded as carry-over insight). On-hand=55, in-transit=0; promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals through Period_42 confirm lead_time=0 historically. Given the clear, sustained regime shift starting Period_16 (higher mean ~200+), I bias the forecast to the recent high-demand regime rather than the full-sample mean. Therefore: use L=default (promised lead time 0) so the OR engine assumes same-period arrivals; use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the last 20 demand samples (captures the post-changepoint high mean while respecting the N cap); use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This raises the base-stock target to prioritize service (profit >> holding cost) while keeping holding exposure tied to recent variability. No overdue or in-transit shipments to reconcile; current on-hand covers only a fraction of one typical high-demand period, so leaning on recent demand avoids under-ordering.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 that is already captured in past carry-over insight; recent periods (Periods 39-43) show high demands (170-250) with frequent stockouts, so we should let the OR engine use its default estimators based on all observed samples and the promised lead time. Choice rationale: L='default' because deliveries have consistently concluded same-period (lead time = 0) and no new evidence requires changing it; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set so the base-stock and cap calculations reflect the long-run data and the sustained higher-demand regime. This balances service level (profit $4 > holding $1, so target service quantile is high) against holding cost; defaults provide a stable estimate given the confirmed lead-time and the documented regime shift handled by the backend's statistics.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history (many periods) consistently shows arrivals same period as order, so no evidence of lead-time drift. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean sustained through recent periods). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N methods based on the most recent regime. Per guidance, choose N = min(regime_length,20) with a floor of 3; the high-demand regime runs from Period 16 through now (Periods 16-44), so I cap at N=20 to emphasize recent high-demand behavior while limiting noise from older low-demand samples. L: use default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. mu_hat: recent_N with N=20 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demands, reflecting the elevated demand level and improving service while acknowledging holding cost. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. This set of parameters directs the OR engine to target a base-stock tuned for the sustained higher demand (improving units sold and profit) while the sigma estimate constrains the safety stock to limit holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Context: profit=$4, holding=$1. On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded deliveries show actual lead time = 0 consistently through Period 45, and a sustained demand regime shift began at Period 16 (higher demand ~200+/period since then). Current on-hand (41) is far below the recent-period demand level, so the OR backend must target the elevated regime to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length since Period 16 is ~30 periods; choose N=20 per the N selection rule capped at 20). This biases the base-stock toward the recent high mean and recent volatility so the backend orders sufficient units to meet elevated demand while the capped order prevents extreme over-ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 decision. Current on-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals same period). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period_16 (noted in history) with consistently higher demand (~200s) from Period_16 onward. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I use a recent-N forecast that focuses on the most recent stable regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 demand samples (this balances responsiveness to the higher-demand regime while using enough data to estimate variability). Using recent_N for mean and std will raise the base_stock to match elevated demand and keep safety stock appropriate given observed volatility, helping the OR backend balance service level (avoid lost sales, higher profit per unit) versus holding cost (holding cost is moderate at $1/unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $788.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly; carry-over already recorded). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (already captured in carry-over history and in the full-sample statistics). Given the confirmed 0-period lead time and the long run of high-demand periods, I will use the default lead time (promised 0) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This lets the backend set a high service quantile (profit/(profit+holding)=0.8 \u2192 high z) to prioritize avoiding lost sales while the holding cost is moderate. Using defaults avoids overreacting to short-term noise and leverages the full historical demand record that already reflects the sustained higher regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $657.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 snapshot: on-hand=39, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (multiple periods), so no evidence of recent shipping delays or lost orders. Recent demand has been in the elevated regime confirmed earlier (carry-over note from Period 19). Given confirmed 0 lead time and stable high-demand regime, I choose the backend defaults so the OR engine uses the full history to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the policy aligned with observed long-run demand while letting the OR engine calculate the base-stock and cap using the profit/holding tradeoff. With on-hand=39 and no in-transit, the OR policy will top up toward the computed base-stock, balancing service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $632.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. Recent history shows sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 16 (recorded previously). Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and confirmed historical lead time=0, arrivals are same-period when ordered. No shipments are overdue. I choose default lead time so backend uses the promised L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This conservative choice leverages the full demand history (including the sustained higher-demand regime) and lets the OR engine compute the base-stock target balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff. No new significant changepoint or lead-time anomaly detected this period.
