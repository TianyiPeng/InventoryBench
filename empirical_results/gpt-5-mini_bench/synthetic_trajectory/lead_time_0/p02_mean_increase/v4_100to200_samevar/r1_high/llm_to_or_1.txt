Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start, no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Promised lead time is the default (0). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96) give mean = 91 units/period and moderate variability. With no evidence of a demand regime change or delayed/lost shipments, I use the backend defaults so base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps parameters grounded in the full-sample demand estimate while the system collects arrive/conclude signals to detect lead-time or demand shifts. Using defaults balances service level (captures average demand) versus holding cost conservatively until we observe concluded arrivals or a changepoint.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Observed: on-hand=81, in-transit=0. Period_1 conclude shows the order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 (arrived=143, lead_time=0), confirming same-period lead time from the single observed shipment. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show no sustained changepoint or multi-period shift in mean/variance (mix of low and high values but no 3+ period consistent trend). Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so the OR backend should be encouraged toward a higher service level; using default demand and volatility inputs lets the backend compute the base-stock that balances high profit vs holding cost. Given the clear evidence for lead_time=0 from the concluded Period_1 arrival and no evidence of lost or delayed shipments, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the backend uses promised lead time and historical sample stats without overfitting to short noisy signals. This keeps orders responsive (same-period arrival) while avoiding overreaction to a single-period demand fluctuation. If future conclude messages show delays or lost shipments, I will update L and mu_hat using recent_N or explicit values.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived with lead_time=0, and there are no signs of lost or delayed shipments. Recent demand samples show no sustained changepoint (no 3+ period shift), so I will use the defaults which let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Using default L (promised lead time = 0) ensures the base-stock calculation covers the current-period demand only (L+1 =1) and leverages the full-sample demand statistics to balance service level against the low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1358.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: on-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1-3 are all 0 (orders placed in P1,P2,P3 arrived in same period), so actual lead time appears to be 0. Demand history samples: [105,36,108,110,96] => mean=91. With L=0 the review+lead horizon is 1 period; expected demand \u224891 units. Current pipeline (on-hand+in-transit=86) slightly under expected one-period demand, so the OR baseline should target roughly one-period mean. No sustained demand regime change detected (variation in P2 is an outlier), so use aggregate estimates. Choices: set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times; use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (targeting mean demand) against holding cost given no strong evidence of a regime shift or upcoming seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3; observed lead_times = 0,0,0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows arrivals matched orders with lead_time=0 consistently; on-hand=96, in-transit=0. Demand sample set provided (periods 1-5) will be used by default formulas. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost or delayed shipments, I select L=default (use promised lead time 0) so the OR backend treats lead time as 0. I also choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, respectively. This balances service level and holding cost using all available demand history while leveraging the confirmed 0 lead time to avoid unnecessary pipeline coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1129.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision with confirmed recent history showing consistent same-period arrivals. Demand context: historical samples for chips(Regular) are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] (mean=91). Recent concluded periods show actual demand in our game history consistent with those samples; no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift. On-hand = 87, in-transit = 0, and there are no overdue or missing shipments to account for. Lead time evidence: multiple concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3, P4\u2192P4, P5\u2192P5) indicate actual lead time is 0. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed realities while leveraging its default statistical treatment, I set L using observed lead times (calculate) and leave demand and volatility to the backend defaults: mu_hat default uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This results in (with L=0) the backend using the full-sample mean (\u224891 units) for the review+lead demand forecast and the full-sample standard deviation for safety stock calculation. This balances service level (profit is high at $19/unit so backend will target a high fill rate) against holding cost ($1/unit) without overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2073.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision: confirmed recent evidence (carry-over) shows actual lead time = 0 periods (orders placed in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period). Current on-hand = 36, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples (environment snapshot) have mean = 91 units/period and std \u2248 27.92. No sustained change in demand mean/variance is evident in the last periods (demand fluctuates but not a sustained regime shift), and there are no overdue shipments to account for. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded arrivals, so I keep L as default (promised). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given high profit-to-hold ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1 encourages higher service levels). With on-hand=36 and in-transit=0, the backend will order toward the computed base-stock to cover expected demand this period while capping order size per its cap rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1153.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: recent concluded history (P1\u2013P7) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in multiple periods) and no in-transit stock now. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [105,36,108,110,96] (provided) plus additional observed demands in concludes (P1\u2013P7) that align with moderate, stable demand with occasional spikes (e.g., 161 in P2 demand exhausted by availability). Current on-hand = 82, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0, so using default lead time keeps the OR backend aligned with supplier performance and avoids extra safety inventory from inflated L. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages the full sample set to produce a base-stock that balances the high unit profit ($19) against holding cost ($1). With L=0 and full-sample statistics, the backend will produce a base-stock that captures average demand while the capped order limit prevents extreme single-period over-ordering. This approach is conservative given stable observed lead time and avoids inventoring excessive safety stock given the low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2316.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=21, in-transit=0, profit=$19, holding=$1. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u20138) are all 0 \u2014 consistent with earlier carry-over confirmation \u2014 so actual lead time remains 0. Demand over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 4\u20138: 60,64,111,65,123) shows an elevated and volatile recent mean compared with the older snapshot; I prioritize recent data to set the replenishment target so orders cover the immediate demand without overstocking. Thus: L use calculated (backend will compute observed average lead time = 0). mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to anchor (1+L)\xd7mean of most recent 5 demands \u2248 84.6 units (captures recent spikes in P6 and P8). sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock. These choices balance service (using recent higher mean and volatility) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost is low but nonzero.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 start. On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 5-9): [64,111,65,123,104] shows a higher and more volatile regime than the earliest samples. No shipments are overdue (recent concludes consistently show lead time=0). Promised lead time remains appropriate. Because profit ($19) >> holding ($1) the OR backend will target a high service level (q \u2248 0.95); to avoid frequent stockouts I bias forecasts toward the recent demand regime. Therefore: L set to default (use promised lead time = 0). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent mean demand (Periods 5-9 mean \u2248 93.4 per period, so (1+L)*mean \u2248 93.4). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes volatility from the same recent window, preserving consistency between forecast and uncertainty. This balances high service-level needs (high profit) against holding costs by using up-to-date demand estimates and confirmed short lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: recent concluded history (P1\u2013P10) shows consistent same-period arrivals (all concluded lead_times = 0). On-hand = 48, in-transit = 0. Given the consistent evidence (multiple periods) that actual lead time equals the promised 0, I set L using the observed lead times (calculate) so the OR engine uses confirmed service timing. Demand history across concluded periods shows variable demand but no sustained regime shift; therefore use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level and holding cost: confirmed L=0 keeps replenishment immediate (no extra pipeline coverage), and default mu/sigma prevent overreacting to single-period spikes while letting the OR engine produce the z*-based base stock.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: confirmed actual lead time = 0 from earlier concluded periods. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows steady arrivals with no outstanding in-transit inventory; current on-hand = 76, in-transit = 0. Profit per unit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) implies a high service quantile (q=19/20=0.95) so OR should target high fill rate but avoid excessive holding. Because actual lead time is consistently 0 (multiple observes) and there is no evidence of a sustained demand regime change, I use the default lead time and population statistics to let the OR backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps the policy responsive to the full historical sample while leveraging the confirmed lead time=0 and avoids overreacting to short-term variability. With on-hand=76 and no in-transit, the backend will compute the order-up-to level and cap appropriately to balance high service level (driven by profit) against holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 start. On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (confirmed in earlier carry-over), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a modest downward drift from earlier high spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 8-12 = 123,104,91,68,88) average ~94.8 units. I select recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to make the forecast responsive to the most recent regime while avoiding overreacting to single-period noise. I also select recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current demand volatility. Using L=default (0) keeps the OR backend\u2019s review period short (orders arrive same period), and the recent-based mu_hat reduces stockouts given current average demand (~95) while controlling holding cost given holding=$1/unit. This balance helps the OR engine compute a base-stock aligned with recent demand and the high profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) shows orders consistently arriving same period they were placed; prior carry-over already confirmed actual lead time = 0. Current state: on-hand=23, in-transit=0. No overdue or missing shipments to reconcile. Demand samples available for baseline estimation; no sustained demand regime shift detected (demand fluctuates but reverts around historical mean). I select L='default' to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. I select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all historical demand samples \u2014 this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run sample statistics, balancing service level (profit-driven high critical ratio) against holding cost. With on-hand low (23) and no pipeline, this will prompt the optimizer to replenish toward the computed base-stock while capping order size per the OR cap to limit overstock risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 start. Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u201314) shows fairly high mean (~90\u2013110) with volatility and no sustained upward or downward shift; latest period (P14) had a stockout after demand=140 but prior periods fluctuate around ~80\u2013110. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we currently have no coverage for upcoming demand; however historic conclude messages (through P14) consistently show arrivals same-period (lead_time=0), and prior carry-over already confirmed lead time 0. Therefore use default lead time (promised 0) so the OR engine will assume same-period arrivals. For demand forecast and uncertainty use the backend defaults (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) because there is no clear, sustained regime change (no 3+ period shift) warranting a recent-N or EWMA override. These default choices let the OR engine compute base_stock from the full-sample mean/SD, balancing service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). This approach also avoids overreacting to the single high demand spike in P14 while ensuring the engine targets an appropriate safety stock given observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1836.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: on-hand=45, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows all orders arriving same period (many concluded messages with arrived units = ordered units). No overdue shipments visible. Historical recent demand (Periods 11-15) = [68,88,106,140,99], recent mean ~100.2 and still volatile. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 0, so I set L using observed lead times. Demand appears to have stabilized around ~100 units in the most recent 5 periods; given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we should target a higher service level (backend will compute z from profit/(profit+holding)). Therefore: set L = calculate (average observed lead times = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 11-15) where demand averaged ~100 and variability is meaningful. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent demand while limiting excess inventory given the low holding cost. The parameters will instruct the OR backend to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 samples, which balances service level (high profit) against holding cost and accounts for confirmed zero lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1-16) show variable demand with recent large spike in Period 16 demand=227 but overall sample set for chips(Regular) (Periods 1-16) will be used by backend. Carry-over history confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrive same period). Given zero on-hand and no pipeline, we should keep lead time as promised (use default) so the OR engine assumes same-period arrivals. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full demand history including the recent spike. Using defaults lets the OR engine set base stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) with its q-based safety factor. This approach is conservative: it uses all available demand history and the confirmed L=0 to avoid overreacting to a single high-demand period while allowing the optimizer to raise orders if overall variability and mean justify it.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show every observed arrival arrived in the same period it was ordered (observed lead_times = 0 across multiple periods), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history across Periods 1\u201317 is volatile but with no sustained new regime (recent spikes are not consistently >3 periods), so I will let the OR backend use the full-sample demand statistics. Given profit=$19 and holding=$1, the backend's service-level q will be high; using the backend defaults (which compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps the base-stock aligned with long-run mean demand while the small holding cost moderates inventory. Setting L via 'calculate' (empirical observed lead times) confirms lead time=0 to the backend; mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the capped ordering rule can control order size and cap risk from variability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Recent state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times across many periods are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so I set lead time method to calculate (average observed lead times -> 0). Demand history (seed samples provided = [105,36,108,110,96], mean \u2248 91) and the backend default formula ((1+L)\xd7mean) is appropriate as a baseline; therefore I select default for mu_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples. Variability will be left to the backend default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). Rationale: with on-hand=0 and no pipeline, the policy should target the historical average demand for the review+lead period; using defaults keeps service level driven by the profit/holding tradeoff embedded in the OR engine while avoiding overreaction to recent spikes that need more evidence. If future conclude messages confirm a sustained new high-demand regime (\u22653 periods), I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 context: on-hand=18, in-transit=0, confirmed lead time = 0 (from earlier concludes). Recent demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 16 (demands P16\u2013P19 = 227,186,210,171). Baseline demand (Periods 1\u201315) avg \u2248 94.53; recent regime avg (P16\u2013P19) = 198.5. Given the sustained spike (4 periods), I forecast using the recent high-demand regime so orders cover the elevated demand immediately (L=0 means same-period arrivals). Choosing mu_hat recent_N with N=4 focuses the OR base_stock on the new mean; sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 captures the increased volatility in recent periods. This balances higher service level to avoid stockouts during the new high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by not inflating forecasts with long-ago low-demand data. With on-hand=18 and no in-transit, the backend will compare pipeline to the (1+L)*recent mean and order up to the capped amount.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 94.53 (Periods 1\u201315) to 198.5 (Periods 16\u201319), +110.3%

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (high-demand regime: Periods 16\u201320 avg \u2248200.6). On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so no incoming units visible. Lead-time history (Periods 1\u201320 conclude) confirms actual lead time = 0 historically. Because the demand regime change is recent and sustained (Periods 16\u201320), I use a short recent window to forecast demand rather than the full-sample mean. Choices: L=default to respect promised lead time (0) and because concluded arrivals show lead_time=0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201320 avg \u2248200.6 \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean over that window); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect observed volatility in the new regime. This raises the base-stock to cover higher expected demand while the OR backend will cap order size; given high unit profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) we prefer higher service (larger z) to avoid lost sales while keeping holding cost moderate.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Demand has shifted up since Period 16 (higher-volume regime). On-hand=50, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed (recent concludes show arrivals every period with lead_time=0). I set L to default to use the promised lead time (confirmed as 0 in prior concludes). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 16\u201321) to capture the new high-demand regime: regime length = 6, so N = max(min(6,20),3)=6. Using the last 6 periods will center mu_hat on the current elevated mean and sigma_hat on the current volatility, which helps the OR backend size base-stock to meet higher service-level needs while avoiding excessive holding by not over-weighting older low-demand periods. This balances Profit ($19) vs Holding cost ($1) by increasing target stock to reduce lost sales under the new regime while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 decision. Recent history shows the demand regime shift (noted in carry-over) beginning Period_16 with consistently higher demand (~190 units). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages (Periods 1\u201322). Current on-hand=60, in-transit=0, so no incoming arrivals are expected this period. I choose L=default to trust the repeatedly confirmed promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime: the last 5 observed demands (Periods 18\u201322 = 210,171,209,187,173) average ~190, so mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean will reflect ~190. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility around this higher mean. These choices keep the OR engine focused on the elevated demand regime (raising target base-stock to avoid stockouts) while using a recent-sample volatility to avoid overstocking given holding cost is low relative to profit (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 summary: confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals P1\u2013P23 arrived same period); recent demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (Periods 16\u201323 show sustained higher demand ~170\u2013227). Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=0 so we are low relative to the new regime. Profit per unit >> holding cost (19 vs 1) so service-level should be prioritized to capture sales. Decision: keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N on the post-changepoint regime to reflect the higher mean (avoid diluting with pre-shift low-demand samples): recent_N with N=8 (Periods 16\u201323) \u2014 this captures the sustained elevated demand. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=8 to reflect current variability in the new regime. These choices push the OR engine to set a higher base stock appropriate to the new demand level while the 0 lead time keeps pipeline short; prioritizing service with modest extra safety given high profit and low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2931.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals matched same-period orders through Period 24). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 16 (avg up ~+110% vs Periods 1\u201315); recent demand since Period 16 is the appropriate forecast basis. Current inventory: on-hand=71, in-transit=0 \u2192 we have no pipeline cover for upcoming demand, so the OR engine must be fed a demand forecast reflecting the higher post-shift regime. I set L to 'default' to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 16\u201324) because the changepoint at Period 16 created a new, sustained higher-demand regime; regime length=9 so N=9 (meets the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using the recent 9-period mean and std (scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) focuses the base-stock target on the higher-demand regime and avoids diluting the forecast with pre-shift low-demand data. This increases service level to capture profitable sales (profit >> holding cost) while the sigma estimate tightens safety stock around the observed post-shift volatility, helping the OR backend balance fill rate against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3451.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (confirmed in past carry-over). On-hand = 45, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u201325 consistently show actual lead_time = 0, so use default lead time. To focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201325) I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regime length = 10 (Periods 16\u201325), so I choose N=10 to capture the higher mean (~~198) and current volatility; this reduces stockouts under the new demand while keeping holding cost awareness. These parameters give the OR backend a higher base_stock tuned to the new regime and a sigma reflecting recent variability, balancing service level (avoid lost sales) against holding costs given profit=$19/unit and holding=$1/unit/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4153.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (previously recorded). Current on-hand=8, in-transit=0 meaning we have virtually no pipeline cover for upcoming demand this period. Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded periods (Period 1\u201326 arrivals matched same-period orders), so I keep L at default (promised lead time=0). To reflect the confirmed demand regime shift (higher mean from Period 16 onward) I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint data. I detect the recent high-demand regime spanning Periods 16\u201326 (11 periods); using N=11 captures that regime without over-weighting older low-demand data. This raises the backend base_stock (\u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 computed over the recent 11 samples), which increases order quantity to restore service level given low on-hand and zero in-transit. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety stock reflects the recent volatility rather than diluting it with older quieter periods. These choices balance profit-driven service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost by targeting the current higher-demand regime and its volatility while relying on the confirmed 0 promised lead time.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28 context: on-hand=30, in-transit=0. Profit$19 vs Holding$1 favors higher service level. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201327 average demand \u2248194 units, up ~105% vs earlier periods). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior history (Period 1\u201327 arrivals all same-period). I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate focusing on the post-changepoint regime: I detect the changepoint at Period 16 and use the last 12 periods (Periods 16\u201327) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those 12 samples (mean \u2248194). I also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=12 so volatility is estimated from the same higher-demand regime. This keeps orders aligned to the new, sustained higher demand and avoids under-ordering given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (avg ~198.5 since Period 16). On-hand = 49, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and previous concludes confirmed actual lead time = 0. To align the OR backend with the new high-demand regime I use recent demand statistics from the entire high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201328, regime length = 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean and volatility. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concludes consistently show 0 lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat increases replenishment target to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean, reducing stockouts under the new regime; recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety-stock calculation captures current demand variability. This balances higher profit per unit ($19) against modest holding cost ($1) by sizing orders to meet the confirmed higher demand while avoiding excessive long-term holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3993.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 decision. Recent history shows a confirmed, sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (post-shift avg \u2248198.5) and actual lead time consistently observed as 0 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no pipeline availability for upcoming demand. Given the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201329 show frequent sells near ~180\u2013220), I use a recent-sample forecast to capture the new mean and volatility rather than diluting with pre-shift low-demand data. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0), consistent with multiple confirmed arrivals at lead_time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=14 (covering Periods 16\u201329, the post-shift regime length) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime only. This raises the base-stock to reflect the ~2x demand increase and avoids stockouts while limiting excess holding by excluding older low-demand samples. With profit=$19 and holding=$1, the backend's service-level mapping will target high fill rates; using recent demand stats helps balance service (avoid lost sales in high-demand regime) against holding cost by not over-weighting obsolete low-demand history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 context: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period_16 (confirmed in carry-over). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so I rely on same-period arrivals. Current on-hand = 5, in-transit = 0; no arrivals will appear during decision (they arrive after decision) so available to meet Period_31 demand is only on-hand. Demand history since Period_16 (Periods 16\u201330, 15 samples) consistently averages much higher than Periods 1\u201315; to capture the elevated demand level I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (the detected recent regime length). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat centers the backend base_stock on the current high-demand regime, improving service while sigma_hat recent_N reflects observed higher volatility; this balances the high profit ($19) against modest holding cost ($1) by letting the OR engine compute the z* service factor internally.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 context: on-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 in prior periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period_16 (Periods 16\u201331 show substantially higher average demand vs. Periods 1\u201315). To reflect the new higher-demand regime I set L to the promised/default (0) since concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 16\u201331) so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the most recent 16 samples (captures the post-changepoint mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=16 so the volatility reflects the same recent regime. These choices keep safety stock aligned to the elevated demand, avoid understocking from using older low-demand data, and preserve low holding cost sensitivity by keeping lead time at 0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period = 33. Recent history (Periods 16\u201332) shows a sustained, higher-demand regime (carry-over recorded previously). On-hand = 16, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is very low vs. recent demand (~200/unit periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period), so I will keep L as promised (default = 0). For demand I will target the recent high-demand regime rather than long-run average: use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201332) so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the elevated mean for (1+L) periods. I choose N=17 (the regime length from Period 16 to Period 32 inclusive) which satisfies the recent_N rules (N between 3 and 20, capped by available samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with the same N=17 so the backend captures the volatility in the new regime and sets safety stock accordingly. These choices push the OR engine toward a higher base-stock and larger cap reflecting the confirmed demand increase, reducing expected lost sales while accepting modest holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit).

Daily Profit: $3230.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3169.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (confirmed earlier). There was a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 with materially higher demand since then; recent periods (P16\u2013P33) show much higher average than P1\u2013P15. Because the demand regime has clearly shifted and is sustained, I bias forecast to the post-change regime by using a recent_N demand estimate over the post-shift window. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0 lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=18 to capture demand from Period 16\u201333 (regime_length=18) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the recent, higher regime; this avoids dilution from the low-demand earlier regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=18 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This combination raises the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while relying on low lead time to avoid excess safety stock; it balances the high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) by concentrating service-level protection on the new, higher-demand regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in multiple concluded periods), and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (previous carry-over insight). Profit per unit is high ($19) vs holding cost ($1), so aim for service with modest safety stock. Because lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, I use the default lead time (promised). I also use the backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples (this captures the sustained higher demand since Period 16). This keeps the base-stock target responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff and the capped ordering rule. No overdue shipments are visible (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time correction or explicit forecasts are required this period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 context: on-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple observed P1\u2192P1 ... P35\u2192P35). A sustained demand regime shift was previously observed starting Period_16 (post-shift average ~198.5). Recent demands (Periods 16\u201335) form the current regime and are the most relevant for forecasting. Therefore: set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the last 20 periods of the higher-demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture volatility in the same recent window. This approach keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating uncertainty from older low-demand data, balancing service level (profit per unit $19) against holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37 decision: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201336) show consistent same-period arrivals (orders placed and arrived in same period), confirming actual lead time = 0 over many samples. Demand experienced a clear, sustained regime shift starting at Period 16: recent demand is much higher than Periods 1\u201315. Given the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201336, ~21 periods), I bias forecasts toward the recent regime rather than the older low-demand periods. Therefore: set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the most recent 20 periods of demand (conservative cap at 20 to reflect the sustained post-changepoint regime). Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while using a volatility estimate from the same recent window to balance service level against the $1 holding cost per unit. This helps avoid understocking from mixing low historical demand with the current higher regime and leverages confirmed lead time=0 so orders arrive same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3925.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. History shows lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed in Period 4 conclude and every subsequent conclude: orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean ~200) which persists through Period 37\u2014recent concluded demands mostly ~170\u2013240. Current state: on-hand=27, in-transit=0, so we have effectively zero pipeline protection for Period 38 demand (demand occurs after decision). Given confirmed L=0, I will use default lead time so the OR engine uses the promised lead time (0) and the backend's full-sample demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Rationale for mu_hat/sigma_hat default: the demand regime shift is already recorded in carry-over insights and reflected in the full historical samples the backend will use; using defaults keeps parameters consistent with observed long-run data and lets the OR engine compute base-stock and its cap appropriately. This balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1 favors higher fill rates) against holding cost, while acknowledging we have no in-transit cushion and should expect the OR engine to order to replenish to the computed base stock immediately (same-period arrival).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: on-hand=37, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed earlier at Period 4 and every conclude since), so no lead-time elongation evidence. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift upward beginning at Period 16; since then demand has remained at the higher level. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent samples only. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms same-period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20, where N is chosen as min(regime_length,20) for the post-Period-16 regime (regime_length \u2248 23 \u2192 N=20). This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime so the backend's base-stock and cap calculations will order enough to avoid stockouts while holding cost ($1/unit) is small relative to profit ($19/unit). With L=0 the mu_hat equals the mean of the last 20 demands and sigma_hat equals the std of the last 20 demands scaled by sqrt(1+L)=1, which balances service level against holding cost given strong recent demand evidence. No overdue shipments or lost orders are observed.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many concluded periods), and there is a sustained demand regime shift upward starting at Period 16 (higher average demand since then). No shipments are overdue or lost. Given confirmed lead time=0 and rich history that includes the post-shift higher demands, I use the defaults so the OR engine computes: L = promised lead time, mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This lets the backend incorporate the full sample set (including the higher-demand regime) and compute a base-stock that balances a high service level (profit >> holding cost, implied q=19/20=0.95) against holding costs using the capped order. Using defaults is conservative and leverages the confirmed 0-period lead time and complete demand history to set appropriate targets.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show confirmed lead time = 0 periods (consistent across many periods). A sustained demand regime shift was previously detected at Period_16 (higher mean since Period_16). Inventory is low relative to the post-shift demand level and there are no in-transit units, so we must size safety/target stock to the higher-demand regime. Therefore: set L = default (promised lead time = 0, validated by concluded history). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (this uses the last 20 demand samples \u2014 roughly Periods 21\u201340 \u2014 per the rule N = min(regime_length,20)). For volatility, also use recent_N N=20 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices ensure the OR backend raises base stock to match the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma estimated from the same recent window so safety stock is neither under- nor over-stated. This also addresses the immediate shortage (on-hand 35, no pipeline) by signaling higher target inventory aligned with the post-Period_16 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4258.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: confirmed low lead time environment and a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period_16. Current on-hand=17, in-transit=0 so available coverage is minimal vs. elevated demand (~200+ per period since Period_16). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period through Period_41). Demand regime shift evidence: Periods 16\u201341 show substantially higher demands vs. Periods 1\u201315. To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I keep L at the default (promised) which matches observed lead time=0. For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N on the most recent high-demand regime to capture current elevated mean; I choose N=20 (cap at 20) because the recent regime length (~Period_16\u201341) is >20 and the most recent 20 periods best represent current mean. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability rather than older low-demand variance. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher, recent demand while the zero lead time keeps pipeline small and reduces unnecessary holding. Given profit=$19 vs holding=$1, the backend will compute a service-level target; supplying mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent high-demand window ensures the OR engine orders enough each period to avoid stockouts under the new regime while limiting carryover inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Current on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 for all observed orders (Period 1\u201342 conclude messages), so promised lead time appears reliable. Demand shifted to a higher regime around Period 16 and has remained elevated since (higher realized demands Periods 16\u201342); given the sustained change and stable lead time, I let the OR engine compute demand forecast over the full history so it captures the new regime in its sample mean/variance. Using default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat delegates (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed from all samples to the backend; this balances service level (high profit vs. stockouts) against holding cost given the confirmed zero lead time and no in-transit stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 context: on-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 4) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (higher mean ~200). Recent periods (Periods 24\u201343 and especially 24\u201343 after the shift) show consistently high demand around ~180\u2013252 with many periods near ~200. Given the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16, I bias forecasts to recent high-demand behavior rather than the long-run mixed sample mean. I therefore keep L at the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead time 0. For demand (mu_hat) I use a recent_N approach to focus on the most recent stable regime; per the changepoint rules I choose N=20 (regime length >20, cap at 20) to capture current average demand over the high-demand regime. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. This configuration raises the base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current high-demand regime, reducing stockouts while the holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1), so prioritizing service level is appropriate. With on-hand=5 and no in-transit, the OR backend will compute orders to bring pipeline+on-hand up to the base_stock targeted for the current high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4450.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 context: on-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201344) show consistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 repeatedly) and a clear, sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (higher average demand since then). No shipments are overdue or missing. Given the confirmed stable lead time=0 and the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201344), I set L to the default (promised) lead time = 0. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-change, higher-demand regime while following the rule to cap N at 20; this captures the most recent 20 demand observations to compute (1+L)*mean. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting high recent demand (protect profit $19/unit from stockouts) while keeping holding exposure moderate (holding $1/unit) by using a recent-sample estimate rather than the long-run average. This balances service level and holding cost given the sustained regime shift and reliable lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3549.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 46. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed across many periods), on-hand = 61, in-transit = 0. Demand exhibits a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 with much higher demand (~200+/period) compared to Periods 1\u201315. Given high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) the OR target service level is high (q\u22480.95) so we should protect against stockouts using the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history shows lead time = 0 reliably. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (regime length since P16 is >20, so N capped at 20). This makes (1+L)*mean reflect the last 20 demand observations (periods 26\u201345 or 26\u201345 depending on indexing) and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This choice balances strong service level (to capture frequent demands \u2248200) against holding cost by using recent demand evidence rather than diluting with older low-demand periods. With on-hand 61 and no pipeline, the OR backend will compute a base stock using the recent mean and std to determine an order that replenishes toward the high-demand regime target while the cap limits extreme orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4229.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 decision. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed in earlier carry-over). Demand has persistently been in the higher regime since Period 16 (average ~198.5 for Periods 16\u201319 and continued high demands through Period 46). Current inventory: on-hand=27, in-transit=0 \u2192 very low relative to recent period demand (~200). To avoid stockouts this period (demand realized after decision) and upcoming periods, I keep the promised lead time (L=default) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent variability rather than diluting with the low-demand early periods. N=20 balances recency with sample size (cap 20). These choices push the OR backend to set a higher base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand in the high-demand regime, increasing units sold (high profit $19) while accepting modest holding cost ($1) to avoid frequent costly stockouts. Sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window so the safety-stock component reflects recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3829.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48. On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed at Period 4 and every conclude since). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period 16 (higher mean \u2248198.5); recent periods (16\u201347) are representative of current demand. With lead time effectively 0 and no pipeline, we must cover current-period demand only. I choose L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent 20 concluded demands within the high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the post-shift regime and avoids dilution from low pre-shift demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the higher, current demand while keeping safety stock and cap computations grounded in recent variability; that balances service (profit per unit $19) against holding cost ($1) given there is no in-transit cover and arrivals are same-period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3229.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. Current on-hand=77, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in many periods (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift around Period_16 (previously recorded): recent demand is much higher than early-period levels. To capture the post-shift demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent steady regime. Regime length since Period_16 is large (>20), so I choose N=20 (captures most recent behavior while smoothing short-term noise). This yields (1+L)\xd7mean based on last 20 demands for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 20 demands for sigma_hat, which biases the OR engine toward higher target base-stock to avoid stockouts under the higher demand regime while keeping variance estimation recent. Because on-hand (77) + in-transit (0) may be low relative to typical demand (~200), these parameters will prompt replenishment up to the backend's capped base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3128.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 context: profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit gives a high critical ratio (q=0.95) so the policy will target a high service level. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (many periods with arrived equal to ordered). Current inventory: on-hand=83, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime (confirmed earlier at Period 16) is the higher regime (~~200 units/period); using a recent-window forecast helps capture that sustained increase. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history strongly confirms 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime (last 20 observed demands), which balances responsiveness and noise reduction; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine computes a base-stock near recent high-period demand while keeping safety stock aligned with the elevated service level implied by profit/holding costs. No overdue shipments or lost arrivals are evident.
