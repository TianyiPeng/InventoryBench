No calendar events provided.\nb) Demand analysis: Historical demand samples for this SKU: P1=105, P2=36, P3=108, P4=110, P5=96. The five-period average demand is 91 units/period, with recent periods (P3\u2013P5) near ~104 average and one low outlier at P2 (36). Given current period is Period_1 (historical P1 demand was 105), a reasonable short-term forecast is roughly 90\u2013105 units for the coming period.\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promises 0 periods but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). We cannot infer any lead-time shift from history\u2014no arrived shipments to analyze.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Because arrivals happen after the decision phase and actual lead time may be >0, ordering should cover at least the upcoming period's demand (L+1 rule) while avoiding excessive holding since holding cost equals profit ($1 each), making overstock costly.\ne) Order logic: Choose a conservative order to cover expected single-period demand while limiting holding exposure. Using recent-period evidence (P1 and P3\u2013P5 near 100) I order 100 units to satisfy likely demand (~100) if the shipment arrives promptly; this limits lost sales risk if lead time=0 or 1, while not creating large holding cost if demand is lower.\n",

The game history observation shows Period_1 sold=83 which is slightly below that long-run mean; with only one observed sale period in the game we should be conservative but avoid stockout. c) Lead time & orders: Period_1 conclude shows ordered=100 arrived=100 with lead_time=0 periods \u2014 confirmed same-period arrival.

No overdue shipments or in-transit pipeline to consider. e) Final order logic: With profit=$1 per sold unit and holding cost=$1 per unit of ending inventory, excess ending inventory yields net zero value (holding cost cancels potential profit), so the rational objective is to cover expected demand but avoid large overstock. Using an expected demand \u2248100 units (rounded conservatively from the ~91 historical average and the observed 83 sale), we order enough to bring available inventory up to that level: 100 \u2212 17 = 83 units.

Earlier periods generally centered ~100.

There are currently no in-transit shipments and no overdue/lost orders. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0 at start of Period 17.
