Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean 91 units/period and moderate variability (std \u224831). Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence to override it. To let the OR backend use its standard estimates and avoid overfitting from limited data, I select default methods: L=default (use promised lead time), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level and holding cost using the full-sample statistics until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained regime change.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 context: promised lead time = 0. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean = 91 units/period and std \u2248 27.9. Current on-hand = 8, in-transit = 0; last period ended with 8 on-hand after demand=83 and an arrival of 91 (ordered P1 arrived P1, confirming lead_time=0 for that order). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments. I therefore use default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (using full-sample mean=91) against holding cost (holding cost = profit, so z* will be moderate). With on-hand 8 and no pipeline, the backend will issue orders to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the computed base_stock while respecting its cap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-2 both arrived with lead_time=0 (Period1->arrived P1, Period2->arrived P2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 but recent realized demands have been high and variable (sold 83 in P1, 90 shortage in P2 with demand 125). I choose L='calculate' to let the backend use the observed lead times average (evidence: two concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). Demand appears to have moved to a higher recent level compared with the full-sample mean, so I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (uses last 3 demand samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=3 to capture recent volatility. These settings tell the OR engine to target safety stock appropriate for the recent higher mean and volatility while keeping lead time at the confirmed short value, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost per unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Demand context: historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show periods 1-5 = [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 0 for the last 3 periods (orders placed P1,P2,P3 arrived in same periods). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for upcoming demand. Service level tradeoff: profit and holding cost are equal (profit= $1, holding= $1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 -> z* = 0, making base-stock = mu_hat. Given consistent evidence of same-period arrivals in conclude messages, I infer actual lead time = 0 and will let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available samples so base_stock equals the unconditional mean demand for the review+lead period. Choices: L set by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (3 concluded samples \u2192 average 0); mu_hat set to 'default' so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples); sigma_hat set to 'default' so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps ordering aligned with observed same-period fulfillment while letting the OR engine balance service level (q=0.5) against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders on Periods 1-3 arrived same period; observed lead_times = 0,0,0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Recent history (Periods 1-4 concludes) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_times = 0,0,0,0) and no in-transit units currently. On-hand = 11 units; recent demands (Periods 1-5 samples) have mean = 91 units/period with noticeable variability (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0, so I use the default lead-time handling to keep orders arriving same period as placed. I choose default demand and volatility methods so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock tied to the full-sample average demand (91) and the backend will set safety stock via the profit/holding ratio. Using defaults is appropriate because we have only one short erratic low demand outlier (36) but no sustained regime shift; defaults avoid overreacting to one low period. With on-hand=11 and no pipeline, the OR engine will order toward the computed base stock to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$1 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (Period 1-5 arrivals matched orders), so actual lead time is 0. Demand history shows no sustained, large shift requiring an alternate demand estimate, and profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) so the OR backend should target a 50% fractile safety factor. I therefore set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (which will be 0 from concluded history). For demand I select the defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because there is no confirmed, sustained demand regime change (insufficient evidence to justify recent_N or EWMA). These parameters keep the base-stock calculation aligned with the backend's statistical approach while leveraging the confirmed zero lead time to avoid unnecessary pipeline buffer; that balances service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 decision: recent concluded history (Periods 1-6) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0 across concluded periods) and no in-transit inventory; on-hand = 0 so we must replenish to meet Period 7 demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so the OR backend will target an approximate median service level (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5). I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (observed lead_time = 0 in concluded history). For demand I use the default (all-sample) forecast: with L=0 the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) which uses the full demand history (Periods 1-6) to smooth short-term variability. Sigma_hat is default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (to avoid stockouts given recent high-demand spikes) against holding cost by relying on the full-sample mean/variance rather than reacting aggressively to the last volatile period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period 8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-7) show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and recent demand has been elevated and volatile: last three realized demands = 55, 115, 110 (Periods 5-7). Promised lead time is 0 and prior carry-over already confirmed actual lead time=0 at Period 4, so I use the default lead-time setting. To make ordering responsive to the recent higher demand while limiting holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent short-run regime: recent_N with N=3 (captures the latest demand level and volatility). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast reflecting current demand (~93 units) and a short-run volatility estimate to set safety stock appropriately. This approach balances service (responds to recent high demand) against holding cost given inventory currently zero and fast (0-period) replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 decision. Recent observed demands (periods 1-8 conclude) show volatile but no clear sustained upward/downward regime: recent demands = [55,115,110,56,56] (most recent 5 periods ending Period_8 show mean around ~78 with high variance). On-hand = 38, in-transit = 0 \u2014 no arrivals expected (all recent orders concluded same period). Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time = 0, so use calculated average lead time to reflect confirmed short lead time. I choose L="calculate" to let the backend confirm the observed 0-period lead time from concluded history. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime and volatility (last 5 demand observations) rather than diluting with much older data; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (critical tradeoff). Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the safety stock reflects current variability. This configuration keeps orders responsive to short lead time and recent demand swings while avoiding excessive inventory holding given current on-hand of 38 and zero pipeline.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 for multiple periods), so promised lead time 0 is reliable. Recent demand history (Periods 1\u20139 concluded demands = 83,125,107,86,55,115,110,56,104; mean \u224893.4) shows variable demand but no sustained upward or downward regime for 3+ periods. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the critical fractile q=0.5 (z\u22480) \u2014 targeting roughly the demand mean is appropriate to balance stockouts vs holding. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no sustained changepoint, use default methods so the OR backend will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set and set L to the promised lead time. This keeps orders responsive (same-period arrival) while avoiding excess inventory under equal profit/holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201310 all arrived same period), so actual lead time = 0 is well supported. Demand history (concluded periods 1\u201310) shows a mixed pattern of high (~100\u2013115) and low (~55\u201360) periods with no sustained (>3 periods) regime shift; no clear recent changepoint to justify overweighting recent samples. Given equal profit and holding cost (profit= $1, holding = $1) the backend's default base-stock calculation is appropriate. Therefore: set L by calculation from observed lead times to confirm 0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set. This balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to short alternating demand spikes and leverages the confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in past orders), so actual lead time remains 0. Recent realized demand (Periods 7-11) = [110, 56, 104, 60, 104], mean \u2248 86.8 but high variance \u2014 use a 5-period recent estimate to capture the current regime. With profit = holding ($1 vs $1) the critical fractile is 0.5 so the OR engine will target roughly mean demand; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the base-stock responsive to the recent alternating high/low pattern. Given zero on-hand and zero pipeline, this raises the immediate order recommendation to cover expected next-period demand while accounting for recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments; continuing to assume promised lead time = 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1-12) are consistently 0, so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Recent demand (Periods 8-12) = [56, 104, 60, 104, 118] shows a higher and variable level compared with earlier periods; I detect no sustained >3-period permanent regime shift but recent five-period behavior best represents immediate demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each) so service-level target q = 0.5 (z*\u22480), meaning the OR engine will effectively target mean demand; therefore I supply a recent-N demand estimate to center orders on current demand while supplying a recent-N volatility estimate for variability. Using recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will focus the base-stock around the latest average demand (\u224888.4 units) and give the backend updated std for the cap calculation, balancing service (avoid stockouts) and holding cost (avoid excess inventory).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 context: on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201313) consistently show arrivals same period as orders; prior carry-over insight (Period 4) confirmed actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has fluctuated but shows no sustained regime change (no 3+ period shift in mean/variance). No overdue or lost shipments are visible. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), implying the backend service target q = 0.5 (z*\u22480), so ordering should center on the demand forecast without aggressive safety stock. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 0) and default demand statistics (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full historical data. This balances avoiding stockouts while not building extra inventory given holding cost equals profit.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. Recent history (Periods 1-14) shows frequent high variability in weekly demand (observed demands: 83,125,107,86,55,115,110,56,104,60,104,118,85,119) with no in-transit inventory and current on-hand=0. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 in prior periods (orders arrived same period). No sustained demand regime shift (mean/variance remain variable but centered near ~95) that would justify deviating from population estimates. Because promised lead time = 0 is confirmed by concluded history and there are no overdue shipments, I select default methods so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base-stock and the capped order. This balances service (use full-sample mean to cover variability) against holding cost given profit=holding so safety stock will be moderate.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201315) consistently show orders arriving same period; lead time confirmed as 0 in earlier carry-over. Recent demand has been high and stable: last 5 period demands = [104, 118, 85, 119, 113], mean = 107.8. I choose L=default (promised lead time 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 so the backend targets (1+L)*recent mean (captures the recent ~108 units demand level). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than older sparse samples. These settings prioritize service (profit and units_sold are equal to holding cost, so matching recent demand reduces stockouts while limiting excess holding).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201316) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand has been volatile with a single large spike in Period 16 (demand=229) but the last several periods (Periods 12\u201316: 118,85,119,113,108/229?) show elevated and variable demand relative to the original 5-sample seed; I therefore place more weight on recent observations to capture current regime while avoiding overreacting to a single extreme outlier. I keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to let the OR engine compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demand samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of the last 5 samples; this balances service level (profit and stockouts are costly because profit=holding) against holding cost by reflecting recent volatility rather than the older overall mean. No overdue shipments are observed.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand shows two very large spikes (Periods 16\u201317: 229, 243) vs long-run ~100s, but the spike is only 2 periods so not yet a confirmed regime shift. Promised lead time = 0 is still supported by abundant concluded evidence; I keep L as default to let the backend assume promised lead time. For demand forecast I use an EWMA to partially respond to the recent high demands while remaining conservative given the spike is not yet sustained (gamma=0.30). This increases responsiveness compared with using the full-sample mean but avoids over-ordering for a potentially transient surge. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent rise in volatility (includes the two spikes) so the cap and safety-stock calculations reflect higher recent variability. These choices aim to balance service (capturing some of the recent demand jump) against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1:$1) \u2014 EWMA prevents overreaction, recent sigma increases safety stock to reduce stockouts if the spike persists.

Daily Profit: $187.00, Daily Holding Cost: $42.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in all observed periods, and recent demands show a sustained upward shift starting Period 16 (229, 243, 187). There are no overdue shipments in-transit. Because the spike is sustained for 3 consecutive periods (Periods 16\u201318), I treat demand as a new higher regime for forecasting. 

L: use 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (all concluded lead_times = 0). This ensures the OR engine can use confirmed operational reality rather than the promised value alone. 

mu_hat: use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 16\u201318) so (1+L)\xd7mean uses the new high-demand regime (avg \u2248 219.7 units). This increases the base-stock to cover the elevated demand observed over the last 3 periods and reduces stockouts given immediate same-period arrivals. 

sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility in the high-demand regime (higher std than earlier periods). 

Rationale vs. costs: Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the OR backend's critical fractile is 0.5; that tends to center base-stock near the mean demand. Given the regime change, using recent demand (N=3) prevents the backend from understocking versus the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased uncertainty. This balances service level improvement against holding costs by updating forecast inputs to current demand conditions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand Periods 16\u201318 = 219.67 vs prior Periods 1\u201315 avg = 96.0 (increase \u2248 +129.7 units, +135%).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 start: on-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals through Period 19 show every order arrived same period (observed lead_times = 0 for concluded orders P1\u2013P19), confirming actual lead time = 0. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 16 (Period 16\u201319 demands = 229, 243, 187, 205; prior periods ~\u224896). To avoid understocking given the higher recent demand, I set L by calculation from observed lead times (will yield 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the new high-demand regime: N=4 (Periods 16\u201319) to capture the elevated mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of recent demands) and recent volatility for safety. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend set a higher base-stock tuned to the new regime while keeping safety stock proportional to observed recent variability. This balances the $1 profit per unit (service benefit) against $1 holding cost by focusing on recent higher demand rather than diluting with older low-demand data. No shipments appear overdue now (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time extension is needed.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21 context: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (Periods 1\u201320 conclude all show lead_time=0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_16 (Periods 16\u201320 demand: 229,243,187,205,194; recent mean \u2248 211.6 vs prior mean \u224896). Current on-hand=22, in-transit=0; recent demand is ~212 per period so on-hand covers only ~0.1 periods \u2014 urgent replenishment needed. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the empirically observed lead time (average of concluded lead times = 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201320) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples (captures the ~212 avg). For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N N=5 so safety stock reflects recent variability, not the low-mean older regime. These choices push the OR engine to raise base stock to meet the higher service-level implied by profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand data. Given on-hand=22 and zero in-transit, this will result in sizeable orders to cover the new regime and reduce lost sales while balancing holding cost through the OR cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (demands P16\u2013P21 = 229,243,187,205,194,174; recent mean \u2248 205.33). On-hand = 38, in-transit = 0, so current coverage is far below recent per-period demand. Promised lead time has historically been confirmed as 0 (no new evidence of change), so I use the default lead time. To align base-stock to the newer demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data: recent_N with N=6 (the most recent consistent regime length P16\u2013P21). This makes mu_hat reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 periods (captures the ~205/day demand) and sigma_hat reflect the recent volatility across those 6 periods. These choices push the OR engine to target a higher base stock to meet the sustained elevated demand while sigma_hat based on recent variance prevents overreacting to older, lower-demand samples. This also accounts for zero in-transit inventory (we expect the OR engine to order up toward the updated base stock).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201322 all concluded with lead_time=0). Demand exhibits a sustained regime shift starting at Period 16 (Periods 16\u201322 show substantially higher demand vs. Periods 1\u201315). To focus the OR engine on the new high-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates based on the post-changepoint window. Chosen L method = default to honor promised lead time (and confirmed by concluded history). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (the detected regime from Periods 16\u201322, length=7 \u2192 N=7) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent high-demand regime. This raises target base stock to reflect higher mean demand while letting the capped ordering logic limit order size; it balances service (avoid stockouts in the new regime) versus holding cost by relying on recent variance for safety stock.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 context: on-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for many periods (orders on Periods 1\u201323 all concluded with lead_time=0). There was a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period_16 (higher demand). To capture the new regime I use recent data from the post-changepoint window (Periods 16\u201323, 8 samples). Chosen methods: L='calculate' to confirm actual lead time from concluded history (will compute average observed lead time, which is 0); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=8 to forecast (1+L)*mean of the most recent 8 demand samples reflecting the higher-demand regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=8 to measure volatility in the same recent window. This keeps the base-stock aligned with the confirmed higher demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods; using recent_N for both mean and std helps the OR backend set an order that balances service (profit per unit = holding cost -> moderate target service level) and holding cost given current low on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed in Periods 1\u201324 conclude messages). Demand underwent a sustained regime shift starting at Period 16: recent periods (16\u201324) average demand \u2248206 units vs prior average \u224896. Given this sustained higher-demand regime (9 periods of elevated demand), I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I focus on the new regime using recent_N over the last 9 high-demand periods (Periods 16\u201324) so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 9 samples). I also use recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat so variability reflects the high-demand regime. These choices raise the base-stock to service the higher demand while avoiding understocking from using the older low-demand data; keeping L=default avoids artificially inflating required pipeline for a lead time change that is not supported by concluded arrivals.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 context: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_16 (demands P16\u2013P25: 229,243,187,205,194,174,227,206,189,171; mean \u2248 202.5). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded messages through Period_25 confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently. Current inventory: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. With L=0 the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7forecast; given the clear regime change I use a recent-window forecast anchored to the post-changepoint data (Periods 16\u201325) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and observed volatility. This ensures the base-stock target rises to cover expected single-period demand (~202.5) rather than being pulled down by older low-demand data. Using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat directs the OR engine to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant 10 samples, which balances service level (avoid stockouts in the new high-demand regime) against holding cost. Because on-hand (35) is far below the recent-period mean demand, this will trigger replenishment up to the recalculated base stock. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift exists (arrivals confirmed each period), so L remains default (promised).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201326 conclusions show arrivals same period). Recent demand regime increased substantially starting Period 16 (sustained higher demand through Period 26). Current on-hand = 7, in-transit = 0 so available inventory is low vs. the new regime (recent daily demand >> 7). No overdue shipments or lost orders observed. Because the higher-demand regime is sustained (Periods 16\u201326, 11 periods), I use recent_N for demand estimates to focus the base-stock on the new regime. I choose N=11 (the length of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most relevant samples. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms lead time 0. This configuration raises the target base-stock to reflect the higher mean and also increases safety stock via the recent volatility estimate, balancing service level (avoid stockouts under the new higher demand) against holding cost given profit=holding ($1:$1).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201327) consistently show actual lead_time = 0 (confirmed earlier). There was a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16: recent periods (P16\u2013P27, 12 samples) have mean \u2248 203.7 units and std \u2248 22.8 units, versus the pre-Period-16 mean \u2248 96. Given the clear, sustained higher-demand regime (\u226512 periods of consistent elevated demand), I set parameters to reflect the new regime. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (the length of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the confirmed high-demand samples. This focuses ordering on satisfying the current elevated single-period demand (1+L = 1) while letting the backend compute the safety-stock tradeoff; profit and holding cost are equal so service-level target will be moderate. Practical expectation: (1+L)*mean \u2248 204 units per period and volatility \u2248 23 units, so orders should target roughly that scale to avoid lost sales while limiting excess holding.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u201328) are consistently 0, confirming same-period arrival reliability. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 16 (periods 16\u201328 have consistently high demand vs. Periods 1\u201315). Given the confirmed demand regime shift, I use a recent-window forecast covering the post-changepoint regime to set demand across the review+lead period. L set to 'calculate' to explicitly use observed lead times (which average 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 16\u201328 inclusive) so the OR engine builds base-stock targeting the new higher mean and measured volatility; this balances service-level (avoiding stockouts in the new regime) against holding cost by not overreacting to older low-demand history. With pipeline=0 and lead time=0, the backend will compute orders to bring on-hand up to the new base stock immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (sustained elevated demand ~200 units per period). On-hand = 36, in-transit = 0 so available coverage is very low versus the elevated demand level; no shipments are currently outstanding. Observed concluded lead times for all concluded orders are 0 (orders in history arrived same period). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed observed lead time = 0. For demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201329) because demand shifted sharply at Period_16 and has stayed high; using recent samples focuses the OR baseline on the new elevated mean and volatility so the backend will target a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while the capped order policy limits overly large single-period orders. I chose N=14 (Periods 16\u201329 inclusive) as the regime length for recent_N (N = min(regime_length,20), capped by available data). This configuration balances raising target inventory to meet the new demand regime while letting the OR cap moderate order size to control holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 decision. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period_16 (earlier carry-over recorded). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover the elevated demand. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals through Period_30 consistently show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. For demand I choose recent_N using the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201330, length 15) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of those last 15 samples and captures the new higher mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=15 to reflect the volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts in the sustained high-demand regime) while letting the OR engine compute the appropriate base-stock and cap given profit=holding, balancing fill-rate vs holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201331) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders ordered on Pn arrived on Pn). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period_16 (Periods 16\u201331 show much higher demand vs Periods 1\u201315). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because every concluded arrival confirms 0 lead time. For demand forecasting I focus on the post-change regime: I choose recent_N with N=16 (Periods 16\u201331) so mu_hat reflects the higher sustained mean over the new regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=16 to capture recent volatility. This increases the base stock to cover the permanently higher demand while keeping safety stock appropriate for recent variability. With on-hand and in-transit both zero, these parameters signal the OR engine to order up to the higher regime-based base stock immediately to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost via the backend's q-based service level cap.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201332) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0, so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting at Period_16; mean demand for Periods 16\u201332 = 207.24 units/period (17 samples) vs earlier avg \u224896, a large, sustained increase. I choose L by 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time = 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=17 (the post-shift regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 17 samples (captures the new higher demand level \u2248207.24). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=17 to capture the volatility within the new regime. This configuration directs the OR backend to size base stock around the confirmed higher mean and volatility while reflecting the zero lead time, balancing service (avoid stockouts against high recent demand) and holding cost (avoid overshooting older low-demand estimates). I am not recording a new carry-over insight because the shift at Period_16 and lead time confirmation were already captured previously.

Period_34. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times across Periods 1\u201333 are consistently 0 (orders that concluded list lead_time=0), and there is a previously recorded demand regime shift starting Period_16 with substantially higher demand sustained through recent periods. Recent demand samples (Periods 16\u201333) show elevated, consistent demand compared with Periods 1\u201315. I therefore (1) set L using 'calculate' to let the backend confirm the observed average lead time (which will be 0 based on concluded history); (2) set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime from Period_16 onward (length of regime = 18 periods from P16\u2013P33; N = min(regime_length,20) = 18). This concentrates the (1+L)-period demand forecast and uncertainty on the most relevant, recent high-demand data so the OR engine raises the base stock to meet elevated demand while avoiding using older low-demand periods that would under-forecast. Given profit=holding, the backend will compute service quantile from costs; using recent samples reduces stockouts in this high-demand regime while limiting excess holding by not overshooting with a long-horizon average.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting at Period 16 (sustained higher demand through Period 34). Current on-hand=19, in-transit=0 so we are low relative to recent demand; promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times consistently 0. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-change regime to capture the new higher mean/volatility: regime from Period 16\u201334 has length 19, so I choose N=19 (within the allowed cap). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect recent elevated demand and variability, which raises the base-stock to restore service while the capped order prevents excessive overshoot. This balances the equal profit and holding cost by targeting the demand regime actually observed and keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent history shows a sustained, higher demand regime that began at Period 16 (carry-over already recorded). Current on-hand = 6, in-transit = 0; promised lead time = 0 and all concluded lead_times = 0, so arrivals historically come same period but are only visible in the next conclude. Given the clear, sustained step-up in mean demand since Period 16, I bias the forecast and volatility to the recent high-demand regime rather than using the long-run average. Therefore: set L = default (use promised 0) because concluded lead times are consistently 0; set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (last 20 periods, Periods 16\u201335) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the new higher mean demand; set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=20 to capture the current regime volatility. This choice keeps safety stock and target base-stock aligned with the much higher recent demand, reducing stockouts while recognizing holding cost parity with profit (profit=holding cost), and the OR backend's capped order will limit extreme replenishment. With only 6 units on-hand and no in-transit, relying on recent regime statistics avoids chronic under-ordering against the elevated demand pattern.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (confirmed earlier). Current on-hand = 58, in-transit = 0, so available coverage is low vs. recent demand (~200+/period). All concluded periods show actual lead time = 0, so use promised/default lead time. To keep service while limiting holding cost, I base demand forecast on the most recent stable window (last 5 periods) which reflects the post-change regime. Therefore: L=default (0); mu_hat set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high mean (~202 units); sigma_hat set using recent_N (N=5) so the backend uses recent volatility for safety stock. This balances higher target fill rates due to higher recent demand while avoiding excessive inventory by using a short recent window and observed zero lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201337 arrivals same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period_16 (avg ~220 thereafter vs ~96 before). Given the clear, sustained regime shift (Periods 16\u201337), I focus forecasting on the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 periods of the new high-demand regime (gives forecast that reflects elevated mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to capture recent variability under the new regime. Using recent_N=20 balances responsiveness to the regime shift (ignores the low-demand past) while smoothing over short-term noise. With L=0 the backend will compute base_stock for a 1-period exposure; the chosen recent estimates increase service (reduce stockouts) appropriate to the higher demand while the sigma estimate moderates the z\xb7\u03c3 safety stock to control holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed at 0 periods (Periods 1\u201338 all show lead_time=0). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period_16 (confirmed in carry-over): recent demand levels (~Periods 16\u201338) are materially higher than pre-Period_16. With lead time stable at 0, orders arrive same period; we must therefore size base stock to cover the elevated recent demand. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint, high-demand regime (recent 20 periods gives a robust estimate while capping at 20). This biases mu_hat upward to match current demand and sigma_hat to reflect recent variability, helping the OR engine set a higher base stock (improving service and capturing profit) while keeping holding cost in check by using only recent-sample volatility rather than older low-demand variance.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded periods show consistent zero actual lead time (Period 1\u201339 all concluded with arrived=ordered same period) and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (higher demand since then). Recent demand samples (Periods 20\u201339 and earlier in the high regime) are far above the pre-Period-16 baseline. With promised L=0 and confirmed same-period arrivals historically, using the default lead time (promised) is appropriate. To reflect the new, sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat: detect changepoint at Period 16, recent regime length \u2248 24 periods (Periods 16\u201339); following rules N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) \u2192 N=20. This uses the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so the OR backend targets stock for the higher demand and appropriate volatility. With profit=holding the service level q = 0.5, the base stock will balance fill rate vs holding cost while the recent_N choice prevents overweighting pre-shift low-demand data. Because on-hand+in-transit = 0, these parameters will prompt orders sized to cover the elevated demand regime while controlling stock variance via the observed recent volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Current on-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently (confirmed at Period 4 and every concluded period since). Demand underwent a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 16 (carry-over insight already recorded). Recent periods (16\u201340) exhibit much higher mean demand (~200s) versus pre-16 (~96). To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use the most recent 20 concluded demand observations to compute (1+L)*mean). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=20 so the OR engine sizes safety stock to recent demand variability. These choices ensure the base-stock and cap reflect the sustained higher demand and the confirmed zero lead time, preventing chronic understocking while limiting extra holding cost from older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: on-hand=15, in-transit=0, no arrivals pending. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (observed repeatedly). There was a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (much higher mean). Because current demand behavior has been in the high regime for many periods (Periods 16\u201341) I choose to estimate demand using the most recent data to reflect the elevated mean and current volatility. L: use default (promised lead time = 0), consistent with repeated concluded observations. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the last 20 demand observations (within the confirmed high-demand regime) so the backend builds base_stock around the current higher mean across the (1+L) review+lead window. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This approach keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand periods. With profit=holding, the backend targets a median service level; using recent data aligns that target with the current regime. No shipments are expected to arrive this period (in-transit=0), so ordering should replenish toward the updated base stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 decision. Context: profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit -> critical to balance fill vs inventory. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 (no arrivals visible). Historical concluded messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier: P1\u2013P42 arrivals all same-period). Demand jumped starting Period 16 and has stayed higher (previous carry-over insight recorded); given sustained higher demand, we keep L as promised (0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. Use default demand/volatility methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples \u2014 this leverages the full demand history while the backend's base-stock formula will trade off profit vs holding cost appropriately. No evidence of new sustained changepoint since last carry-over insight. Parameters chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat/default and sigma_hat/default to let the backend compute demand forecast from all historical samples and apply its capped ordering policy.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows a clear, sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (confirmed earlier). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals for many periods confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period 4 insight and all subsequent conclude lines show lead_time 0). Because demand regime shifted upward and has persisted for many periods, I base demand forecasts on the recent high-demand regime rather than the full-sample mean. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean over review+lead). This balances responsiveness to the sustained higher demand while smoothing short-term noise. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture volatility in the same recent window. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility will raise the base-stock to meet the higher demand regime and reduce stockouts while the zero lead time keeps pipeline short so holding cost is not inflated unnecessarily.

There was a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (higher mean); to reflect the current high-demand regime I use a recent-window estimate. L: use 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time (which is 0 based on concluded history). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (regime since Period 16 has length >20, so N capped at 20 per rules). This biases the forecast toward current high demand while smoothing short-term noise. sigma_hat: also recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility in the high-demand regime. Using recent_N for both mean and std helps the OR engine raise base stock to meet the higher post-changepoint demand, while the capped ordering policy will limit single-period order size to control holding cost. Given profit = holding cost, the service-level target is moderate; these settings increase availability in the high-demand regime but rely on the OR cap to avoid excessive overstock from a single period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Profit= $1, Holding= $1 so service level tradeoff symmetric; use evidence-driven forecast. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201345 arrivals all same-period). Demand shifted up starting Period 16 and has persisted through Period 45 (sustained higher demand). To capture the new high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast that focuses on the most recent regime. Regime length since Period 16 to Period 45 = 30 periods; per rules I cap N at 20 (N = min(regime_length,20) = 20). Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time 0, which matches observed); mu_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to reflect the elevated mean demand over the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This increases order targets to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while the OR engine will cap orders via its cap parameter to limit over-ordering and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly since Period 4). Demand experienced a sustained, large upward regime beginning at Period 16 (carry-over insight from Period 19). Current inventory: on-hand 52, in-transit 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed this period would arrive during this same period's arrivals (but arrival visibility lags to the conclude message). Because demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 and that regime is long (Periods 16\u201347, ~32 periods), I use recent data to capture the elevated mean and recent volatility. For L I use the default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed actual lead time. For mu_hat I select recent_N with N=20 (per rule: N = min(regime_length,20) capped, regime_length \u224832 \u2192 N=20) so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples to reflect the high-demand regime. For sigma_hat I also select recent_N with N=20 so the backend uses recent volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 20 samples). These choices raise the base-stock to cover the elevated demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock. They also respect the 0 lead time (no extra L-multiplier). Given on-hand=52 and no in-transit, the OR engine will order up to the computed base_stock minus pipeline; capping will limit extreme orders. This balances service level under the new higher-demand regime against holding cost (holding cost equals profit here, so target service level q = 0.5 in the OR formula is implicitly considered by the backend).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 context: on-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed Periods 1\u201347 concluded lead_time=0). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 16 (documented in carry-over). Recent demand has remained at the higher regime; to reflect the new demand level I use a recent-window forecast. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 (capture the most recent high-demand regime while respecting the N selection rule: regime_length >20 so N=20). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored to current elevated demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand variance. These choices ensure the backend raises the base-stock to service the higher demand while sigma_hat increases safety stock for variability; using lead time = 0 keeps orders arriving same period so we don't overstock for extra pipeline. Given profit=holding, the backend will balance service level vs holding cost using these updated recent estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs early history; last 5 observed demands (Periods 44\u201348) = [189,183,148,179,161], mean = 172. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals show 0, so using default lead time keeps OR engine aligned with reality. With profit = $1 and holding = $1, service level tradeoff is balanced (q = 0.5 \u2192 moderate safety stock). Because demand clearly moved to a higher regime and the most relevant signal is the most recent weeks, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the immediate regime (reduces risk of over-ordering from older low-demand samples). I also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This setup asks the OR engine to target a base stock based on the recent elevated mean and volatility while respecting the cap; it keeps orders focused on meeting one-period-ahead demand (L=0) and avoids holding excessive inventory given equal profit/holding costs. Expected next-period demand ~172 units, so with on-hand=35 we will order enough to bring pipeline+on-hand toward that base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (documented earlier), and all concluded arrivals report lead_time = 0 (Period 1\u201349 concludes: arrived same period as ordered). On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover current-period demand plus safety stock. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 0). For demand and volatility I use the default formulas so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps forecasts anchored to the full, updated sample set (including the high-demand regime) and leverages the backend's base-stock calculation to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff. Using calculate + defaults avoids overreacting to short-term noise while ensuring orders cover the confirmed zero lead time and the elevated mean demand observed since Period 16.
