Given high unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/period) and observed Period_1 demand historically =110 (and a history average \u224897), I place an order targeting the higher, recent-period demand to avoid a lost-sales hit. Therefore order 110 units for Period_1.",

No calendar events provided for Period_2; no seasonal adjustment needed.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Use available demand evidence. Historical sample table suggests Period_2 demand \u2248116 units. The Period_1 conclude shows realized demand=139 (higher than the sample), but this is only a single high observation \u2014 insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift. I treat expected Period_2 demand in the range 116\u2013139, leaning toward the historical sample as the prior but acknowledging upside risk from P1's 139.\n\nc) Lead time / missing-orders: Period_1 conclude explicitly reports the Period_1 order arrived in Period_1 with lead_time=0. This is direct evidence that actual lead time equals the supplier promise (0 periods) at least for that shipment. However this is only one data point, so I will not record a long-term insight yet.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With confirmed lead_time=0 (from P1 conclude), any order placed now can arrive during Period_2 before demand is realized, so we can meet Period_2 demand from new arrivals.\n\ne) Final order logic: Marginal profit per sold unit is high ($19) compared to holding cost ($1 per unit per period). Given the lost-sales setting and one recent large demand (139), it's better to err on slight overstock rather than understock. I order to cover the plausible upper-range demand while avoiding excessive ending inventory. I choose to order 130 units: this is above the historical Period_2 mean (116) but below the single higher observed demand (139), balancing service level and holding cost.\n\nSummary decision: order 130 units to arrive this period (lead_time appears to be 0), providing sufficient stock to meet expected demand while limiting holding cost risk.",

The provided longer historical samples (110,116,74,101,85) show variability but the most recent two actual demands are higher, suggesting current regime ~120\u2013130 units/period. c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0. Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both concluded as arriving in the same period (P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2) which supports actual lead_time = 0 for two periods. This is suggestive but not yet a 3+ period sustained confirmation, so treat 0 as likely but keep caution. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Current on-hand = 16, in-transit = 0.

This is consistent evidence that actual lead time = 0 periods.

Period 1 showed higher demand (139) but that was a stockout-affected signal; the last three periods form a consistent regime. c) Lead time / orders: Prior carry-over already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period).
