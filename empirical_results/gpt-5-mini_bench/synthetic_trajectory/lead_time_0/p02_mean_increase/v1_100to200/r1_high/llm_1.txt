No sustained shift or seasonal signal is evident (only 5 samples, and no 3+ period consistent change). c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown; no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we start fully exposed to stockouts this period. e) Order logic: Holding cost ($1) is small relative to profit ($19), so the cost of slightly overstocking is low compared to lost profit from stockouts. I balance service level vs. holding cost by targeting roughly one period's expected demand plus modest safety. Using the 5-period historical average (\u2248102) and giving weight to the higher early-period value (141) and preference to avoid stockouts, I place an order of 140 units. This should cover likely demand this period even if actual lead time turns out to be 0 or 1; we will update future orders once conclude messages reveal actual arrivals/lead time.",
