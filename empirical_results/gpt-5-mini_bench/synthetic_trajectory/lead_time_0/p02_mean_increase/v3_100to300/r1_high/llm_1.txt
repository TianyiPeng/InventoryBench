Sample mean = 100.6 units/period, sample standard deviation \u2248 25 units. No clear trending or seasonal pattern in the five-period sample. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown. No concluded arrivals or late-order evidence available yet. Because actual lead time may be \u22650 and orders can be lost, we must balance risk of stockout vs. potential lost shipments; however initial on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so risking stockouts is costly given high unit profit. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand 0, in-transit 0. Expected one-period demand \u2248 101 units. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19/unit), so err toward stocking somewhat above mean demand to capture more sales, but avoid extreme overstock given demand variance. e) Final order logic: target to cover roughly mean + 1 standard deviation to provide a reasonable service level against observed variability while keeping holding cost moderate. Order = round(100.6 + 25) \u2248 126, choose a conservative integer 125 units to cover expected demand this period and provide a small safety buffer.",

This confirms at least one observation of same-period (0) lead time; therefore an order placed now will arrive within this same period and can satisfy Period 2 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 26, in-transit = 0.

These two observations indicate a near-100 units/period demand. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived in the same period (conclude messages show lead_time=0 for P1 and P2). This implies actual lead time = 0 so orders placed now will arrive before demand in this period. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 1, in-transit = 0.

The additional historical sample list showed some variation in other contexts, but the most recent 3 periods form a consistent regime. c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: supplier promised LT=0 and we have three consecutive conclude messages showing arrived=ordered in Periods 1\u20133 (ordered P1 arrived P1, P2->P2, P3->P3). This confirms actual lead time = 0 periods. d) Inventory & pipeline: current on-hand = 1, in-transit = 0.

Required order = target_on_hand - current_on_hand = 109 - 14 = 95 units. This balances strong penalty for stockouts (high lost profit) against low holding cost.

Lead time & pipeline: All concluded periods show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Current on-hand = 18, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, orders placed now arrive before demand is realized this period. Decision logic: Marginal economics strongly favor stocking to meet expected demand because expected marginal profit per sold unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1). Even with some uncertainty, the expected value of an additional unit sold justifies stocking up to the demand forecast. Target stock for Period 14: match expected demand \u2248 113 units. Therefore order quantity = max(0, target_stock - on-hand) = 113 - 18 = 95 units. This balances high per-unit profit against modest holding cost and uses latest demand evidence. If demand materially shifts in coming periods, future orders will be adjusted accordingly.",

Required order = target_stock (\u2248300) \u2212 on_hand (55) = 245 units. I avoid large overstock because holding cost accumulates each period; the requested order balances high lost-sales cost given large profit against holding cost. If demand surprises upward, we can place more in subsequent periods due to 0 lead time. If demand falls, holding cost is modest relative to profit so minor overstock is acceptable.",
