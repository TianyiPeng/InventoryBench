No evidence yet of a regime shift. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: supplier promised lead_time=0 but we have no concluded arrivals yet and in-transit=0. There is no confirmed lead-time observation to change the promise; conservatively we must allow for the possibility that orders may arrive same period but could also be delayed. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0 and In-transit=0, so without ordering we'll stockout this period. Expected demand this period \u2248 92 units. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs. profit $4/unit, so excess inventory carries a non-trivial cost. e) Final order logic: Order enough to meet expected demand plus a small safety buffer for variability but avoid large overstock. Using mean demand ~92 and a modest ~8% buffer to protect service (and because we have no pipeline), I order 100 units. If actual lead_time turns out to be 0 the order will arrive this period and satisfy demand; if lead_time>0 we will at least have flow started but must watch for delayed arrivals in future conclude messages.",

The prior confirmed regime change (Periods 22\u201324) raised mean to ~36.7. The last three periods average \u224834.3 with an upward single-period spike to 41 at P27. This does not yet constitute a new sustained (>3 periods) regime shift \u2014 variability is moderate.\n\nc) Lead time / orders: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period they are placed). No in-transit shipments; no missing orders.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and be available to satisfy demand this period.\n\ne) Final order logic: Objective maximizes Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory. Profit per sold unit = $4, holding cost = $1 per unit per period (charged even on starting inventory). Given we have zero on-hand and same-period arrivals, we should order to cover expected demand while avoiding excess inventory that incurs holding cost. Using recent demand evidence (expected demand ~34) and guarding against the observed 41-unit spike, I place a conservative cover order of 40 units to meet likely demand while limiting holding cost exposure. If demand stays lower, holding cost reduces net reward; if demand spikes, we capture additional profitable sales.\n",

More recent single-period demands (P30\u2013P34 = 27,33,28,10,32) are noisy; the P33 demand=10 is an outlier relative to the 22\u201332 window.

A short-window forecast that weights most recent periods is appropriate because demand has varied rapidly across regimes historically.\n\nc) Lead time / deliveries: All concluded messages show orders arriving the same period (arrived = ordered on same period, lead_time = 0). This confirms the supplier continues to deliver with 0 actual lead time; we can expect same-period replenishment when we place an order this decision phase.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 8, In-transit = 0.
