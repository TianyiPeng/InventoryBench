Five-period average = 93 units; recent single-period sample (P1) = 61 is below the 5-period mean but not by a sustained trend. c) Lead time / pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Supplier promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown; there is risk orders could arrive later. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Given zero on-hand and zero pipeline, if orders experience any positive lead time we will stockout unless we order. e) Order logic: With profit $19/unit and holding cost $1/unit/period, the margin strongly favors having inventory rather than risking lost sales. Using the 5-period average demand (93 units) as a demand forecast for the upcoming period balances recent variability without overreacting to a single low period. Given unknown actual lead time, ordering the forecasted-period demand provides the best tradeoff between capturing high per-unit profit and limiting holding cost exposure in future periods.",

No special events to expect. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical sample series (given in problem statement) has mean ~93 units/period with Period_2 sample = 107, indicating variation. The actual game history shows Period 1 sold 66 (lower than the sample P1=61 vs observed 66), so recent single-period demand is noisy. c) Lead time / arrivals: Period 1 order (93) arrived in Period 1 and the conclude message explicitly reported lead_time = 0 periods. That demonstrates the supplier can deliver within the same period for that order. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 27, in-transit = 0. With lead_time observed as 0, an order placed now will arrive in Period 2 before demand is realized (and will be visible in the Period 2 conclude message next period). e) Forecast & order logic: To balance service level and holding cost, I use the Period_2 historical sample demand (107) as the best anchor for this period's demand. Required replenishment = forecast_demand (107) - on-hand (27) = 80 units. Given high per-unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/period), it's valuable to satisfy expected demand rather than risk stockout. Therefore place an order for 80 units so on-hand + arrivals can cover the expected Period_2 demand.",

Product is a regular chips SKU with steady short-run demand.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Recent realized sales: Period 1 sold 66; Period 2 demand at least 117 but sales were capped at 107 because of stockout. A simple unbiased forecast uses the recent realized demand levels. The provided historical sample set for this SKU suggests values in the 60s\u2013140s range; the two most recent observed demands (66 and 117) average ~91.5. Given the stockout in Period 2, true demand that period was at least 117, so target demand for Period 3 should be near the recent average (~92).\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Period 1 (arrived 93) and Period 2 (arrived 80) both had lead_time = 0 (arrived same period). This implies actual lead time is 0 periods, so orders placed now will arrive in Period 3 before demand is realized.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time appears to be 0, an order placed now can be used to meet Period 3 demand. No overdue shipments are present.\n\ne) Final order logic: Aim to satisfy expected Period 3 demand while avoiding excess ending inventory (holding cost = $1/period vs. profit $19/unit). Using the recent-average forecast (~92 units) balances service level against holding cost and covers likely demand including the recent high shown in Period 2. Therefore place an order for 92 units (will arrive in Period 3 given observed lead time 0).",

The last two periods show substantially higher demand than P1; a short-run average over P2-P3 ~99, full-period average P1-P3 ~88. There is an upward tendency from P1 to P2, then slightly lower in P3 but still well above P1. Given small data sample, expect period-4 demand near ~100\u2013125 units. c) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1/P2/P3 all arrived in the same period with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived same period). No shipments missing or delayed. Treat lead time as 0 periods. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; since lead time is 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period_4 and be available to meet Period_4 demand. e) Final order logic: Profit per unit sold = $19, holding cost = $1 per unit/period. The penalty for lost sales (foregone $19 profit) is much larger than the holding cost, so bias toward having modest safety stock. Forecast demand ~100 units; to protect against upward variance and avoid lost sales, place an order to cover expected demand plus small safety buffer.

With confirmed L=0, any order placed now will arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period_5 demand.

The most recent 4-period average (P4\u2013P7) = (92+93+93+68)/4 = 86.5 units. This suggests a stabilized recent demand around ~86\u201387 units. There is some volatility (high at P3 then lower), but the last four periods are consistent enough to use ~87 as the forecast for the upcoming period.\n\nc) Lead time / orders: Prior carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (observed arrivals matching same-period orders).
