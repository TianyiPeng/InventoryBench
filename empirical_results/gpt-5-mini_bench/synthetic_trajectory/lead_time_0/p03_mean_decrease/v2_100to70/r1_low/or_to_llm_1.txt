{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: From Period 1 conclude we observed: ordered=93 arrived=93 (ordered Period 1, lead_time was 0). That confirms actual lead time = promised lead time = 0 for the single observed period. No multi-period evidence yet to record as a sustained change.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 0. With lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 2 and be available for Period 2 demand (arrivals will be visible in the Period 2 conclude message at the start of Period 3). Historical sample mean across the five supplied samples is 93 units/period (samples: 61,107,84,144,69 \u2192 mean=93). Period 1 observed demand was 59 (lower than the 5-period mean). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 sale profit, $1 holding cost), implying a critical fractile of 0.5 (median-oriented policy); stocking to the median demand is appropriate rather than to the mean when variance is high.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Evaluate OR recommendation: OR recommends 54 units. Given on-hand 34 + OR order 54 \u2192 available 88 units, which is below the 5-period sample mean (93) but close to the last observed period demand (59). OR uses promised lead time and all historical samples; it also applies caps that produced 54. Because we only have one recent observed demand (59), and variance is high (std \u224833), strictly following OR=54 risks a small probability of stockout if demand reverts toward the multi-period mean, but ordering too much increases holding cost equally to profit.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final decision and trade-off: I increase OR's recommendation slightly to better cover the recent realized demand while staying conservative given limited confirmation of a sustained regime. I order 59 units \u2014 this brings available inventory to 34 + 59 = 93 units (matching the 5-period mean). This choice hedges between the OR cap and the most recent realized demand: it avoids an obvious shortfall if demand is near historical mean, while not creating excessive extra holding cost beyond expected sales under equal profit/holding trade-off.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Implementation notes: Because lead time = 0, the ordered 59 will arrive during this period and be available for Period 2 demand, though the arrival will only be visible in Period 2 conclude (read at start of Period 3). No carry-over insight is recorded (insufficient sustained evidence).",

Period 3 (Period_3) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1) Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0). That indicates promised lead time 0 has been observed twice, so orders placed now will arrive during Period 3 and can satisfy Period 3 demand. However, this is only 2 observations, so I will not record a formal carry-over insight (policy requires \u22653 periods for sustained confirmation).\n\n2) Demand assessment: The OR baseline uses the full historical sample (mean \u224893). Recent realized demand in the game is lower: Period 1 sold 59, Period 2 sold 75. The two-period recent average is 67 units \u2014 materially below the long-run sample mean of 93. Given only two recent periods we should be cautious, but they suggest demand is currently lower than OR assumes.\n\n3) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 18, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0 observed, new order will arrive this period and be available for today's demand. To meet expected demand this period (~67 based on recent average), we need roughly 67 - 18 = 49 additional units.\n\n4) OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 68 units (it effectively rebuilds toward historical base-stock). That would leave ending inventory high and incur holding cost equal to profit ($1) \u2014 so overstock is costly given holding cost = profit. Because recent realized demand is lower than OR's long-run mean, and holding cost equals profit (critical fractile 0.5), I reduce OR's order.\n\n5) Final decision: Order 50 units. Rationale for number: it slightly rounds up the immediate shortfall (49) to provide a small buffer for variability while avoiding aggressive restocking to the long-run mean. With order=50 arriving this period, expected available inventory for Period 3 demand \u2248 18 + 50 = 68, which covers the recent two-period average demand (~67) but avoids unnecessary holding exposure if demand stays below historical mean.\n\nRisk notes: If demand reverts quickly to the historical mean (~93), we may stock out next period because pipeline is zero after Period 3; but with holding cost equal to profit, conservative ordering is preferred until sustained higher demand is observed. Monitor arrivals and demand; if Period 3 demand is high, increase future orders accordingly.",

That confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (matches promised) with 3 consistent observations. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no coverage for Period 4 demand if high. Demand analysis: recent realized demand has risen sharply (P1=59, P2=75, P3=131). Historical sample set (provided elsewhere) includes even larger values (e.g., 144), so upside demand risk is material. OR recommendation: 92 units (capped base-stock) uses promised L and historical samples; with L=0 OR's base-stock is essentially a single-period target. Adjustment decision: I will increase OR's 92 to 100 units (+8) to provide modest additional coverage against the clear recent demand spike (P3=131) while keeping holding risk limited. Rationale for size: profit and holding costs are equal ($1 each), so extra units that do not sell in the next period incur full holding penalty; therefore I avoid a large overshoot and choose a conservative bump (~9% above OR).

Therefore an order placed now in Period 5 will arrive during Period 5 before demand is realized. Use L=0 for planning.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate and target inventory: The OR baseline uses historical samples to estimate single-period mean demand. The provided historical samples give a single-period mean \u2248 93 units. With profit = holding ($1 = $1), the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the base-stock target for the (L+1)=1-period horizon is the mean demand \u2248 93 units (no extra safety stock from the fractile calculation).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Current inventory position: On-hand = 43, In-transit = 0. With L=0, orders arrive same period, so we should order enough such that on-hand + order \u2248 target base-stock of 93.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare to OR recommendation: OR recommends 45 units. That would bring inventory to 88 (43+45), slightly below the mean target of 93.

This fills expected demand without adding safety stock (consistent with q=0.5).

The OR baseline (capped base-stock) produced a recommendation of 90 units (OR used promised L and historical data). Recomputing OR-style base stock with L=0 gives base_stock \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 = 93; the OR cap is >93, so an uncapped order would be 93 (OR recommended 90, likely due to rounding/cap effects).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Cost trade-offs: Profit = $1/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the optimal base-stock balances at the mean demand (no extra safety stock from the fractile). Because profit and holding costs are equal, over-ordering is costly (each extra unit costs as much to hold as it yields in profit if unsold), while under-ordering forgoes equal profit. Given this symmetry, ordering to the expected mean is appropriate.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Recent demand & variability: Demand has been variable; there were stockouts in Periods 3 and 5 (observed sales limited by inventory), suggesting realized demand can exceed our on-hand. However, with lead time = 0 we can replenish immediately. Because holding cost equals profit, I avoid adding precautionary stock beyond the mean.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision vs OR: OR suggested 90; the computed base-stock is 93 (historical mean).

Average demand = 604 / 7 \u2248 86.3 units per period. Demand is volatile (several high periods like 131,127 and lows like 46,57), but with profit = holding cost the OR's critical fractile is 0.5 (no upward safety bias). OR's capped baseline recommended 43 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory policy decision: With L = 0 we should aim to have ~one period's demand available (no multi-period pipeline). Expected demand \u2248 86 units; current on-hand = 47, so incremental order \u2248 86 \u2212 47 = 39 units.

This brings on-hand+arrival capacity close to expected demand for the period while minimizing expected leftover inventory.

Historical sample mean used by OR across the 5 provided samples is 93 units/day (samples: 61,107,84,144,69 \u2192 mean=93). Recent actual demand episodes (Periods 3,5,6,8 show high single-period demand: 131,109,127,115) suggest demand is volatile but the 5-sample mean already reflects high variance. With profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so OR's base-stock equals the mean (\u224893). OR's capped policy produced a recommendation of 92 units (close to the sample mean).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Decision logic vs OR baseline: Given confirmed lead time = 0, no pipeline to cover, and the profit/holding symmetry (makes stockouts and overstock equally costly), following OR's recommendation keeps expected loss balanced. Recent high-demand periods argue against a large downward adjustment; equally, holding cost equals profit so we should avoid systematic overstock. There is no sustained (3+ period) regime shift since the high demands are intermittent across the sample, so no new carry-over insight is recorded.\n\nFinal strategy: Order 92 units (follow OR recommendation).

Historical demand (recent concluded periods P1\u2013P9) centers around roughly 90\u2013100 units per period; the OR capped base-stock recommendation is 91 units. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), giving a critical fractile q = 0.5 and z* = 0, so the correct base-stock equals the (1-period) mean demand \u2014 which matches OR's recommendation.\n\nDecision logic: Because lead time is confirmed as 0, an order placed now will arrive during Period 10 before demand is realized, so we can safely order up to the base-stock level. On-hand is 1, so to reach OR's base-stock target of 91 we should order 90, but OR's recommendation is 91 (OR computes order as base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory where OR treats pipeline differently).

Early sample set provided (Period_1\u2013Period_5: 61,107,84,144,69) gives a single-period mean \u224893 units; the observed full history (Periods 1\u201322) likewise centers near ~80\u2013100 with frequent sales in the 80s\u2013100s. Given profit = holding cost, the OR\u2019s critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0) so its base-stock equals the estimated mean; its cap reduced volatility and produced 85 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory policy reasoning: With L=0, we need to cover this single upcoming period. On-hand is only 4, so without ordering we risk a large stockout if demand follows recent averages (~90).

I do not increase it because demand shows variability but no sustained upward regime shift (no 3+ period signal); I do not decrease it because on-hand is low and same-period arrivals mean we can meet demand now. This action minimizes expected lost sales while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Carry-over and monitoring: No new sustained pattern warrants recording now (lead time already recorded as 0).

Use L=0 for planning.\n- Inventory: on-hand = 31, in-transit = 0 (nothing arriving later this period).\n- Demand assessment: recent demand has been higher than the very early-period samples. Look at the most recent 5 periods (P20\u2013P24): demands = [73, 95, 84, 101, 59], average \u2248 82.4 units/period. With L=0 we need to cover current period demand (L+1 = 1 period). Given some variability (observed single-periods up to 101), target stock should be near the recent mean.\n- OR recommendation: 58 units. OR uses promised lead time and older historical samples; its capped base-stock gave 58. OR's q = profit/(profit+holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z*=0, meaning base-stock equals mean demand estimate. OR's recommendation of 58 is slightly below the recent 5-period mean (\u224882) because OR includes older samples and capping behavior.\nDecision logic and final order:\n- With on-hand 31 and recent single-period demand \u224882, ordering 51 would bring available inventory to \u224882 (31+51), which matches the recent mean but leaves little buffer for variability (we saw demand up to 101).\n- OR's 58 raises available inventory to 89 (31+58), providing a modest safety buffer against demand spikes while not creating excessive holding cost (holding cost = profit, so we avoid extreme overstock).\n- Lead time confirmed = 0 means the order will arrive this period and be available for the current demand; therefore placing the order now immediately protects against stockout this period.\nAction chosen: follow OR recommendation of 58 units to provide a modest buffer above the recent mean demand while respecting the capped baseline.\n\nQuantitative check: on-hand 31 + order 58 = 89 available vs recent mean \u224882 and recent max 101; this reduces stockout risk without incurring large holding penalties given holding cost equals profit.\n",

I additionally computed realized demand over the full available history (Periods 1\u201328). Total demand across Periods 1\u201328 = 2395 units \u2192 empirical single-period mean \u2248 85.5. Recent long-run mean (\u224885.5) is lower than the OR's \u03bc\u0304=93 from the small sample. Demand is variable but shows no sustained regime shift needing a stored carry-over insight (variability has occurred but not a 3+ period sustained change beyond normal fluctuation).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Service policy & OR baseline: Profit = $1, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0.

Demand history: long-run empirical mean from the provided sample set is ~93 units/period (the OR baseline's internal stats), but recent realized demand shows considerable variability and a somewhat lower short-run pace (e.g., Periods 29\u201333 demands = 63, 91, 89, 105, 37 \u2192 5-period average \u2248 77). With lead time 0, any order placed arrives within the same period and will be available to meet that period's demand; there is no pipeline delay to hedge. Cost structure: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile = 0.5 (symmetric cost of under- vs over-stocking), so the optimal tradeoff is to target median expected demand rather than aggressively overstock for safety. Inventory economics and decision: given on-hand 50 and expected single-period demand likely in the 70\u201395 range (depending on whether you weight long-run vs recent), we need roughly 20\u201345 additional units to meet a typical period demand without excess ending inventory. OR's capped policy recommends 36 units; that falls squarely in this reasonable adjustment range and is modest (keeps ending inventory from ballooning and avoids large holding cost while still covering normal demand). Risk considerations: recent Period 33 demand was a low 37 (which produced ending on-hand = 50), so ordering too much increases holding cost with little upside. Conversely, ordering too little risks lost sales at periods with demand ~90\u2013100. Given symmetric costs and confirmed lead time = 0, I prefer to accept OR's conservative 36 to balance these tradeoffs. Final action: order = 36 units this period.

That confirms actual lead time = 0 (matches carry-over insight from Period 4). Therefore an order placed now will arrive during this same period before demand is realized.\n\nInventory & pipeline: On-hand = 35, In-transit = 0 (nothing pending). Because lead time = 0, we can top up on-hand immediately with any order placed in this decision phase.\n\nDemand outlook: Recent realized demands show variability but an overall moderate level. Last five demands (Periods 31\u201335) = [89, 105, 37, 71, 41], average \u2248 68.6. A slightly longer window is similar with many periods in the 60\u2013100 range but with occasional low days (e.g., 37, 41). Given the most recent two periods were 71 and 41, I assume expected demand this period is near ~65\u201370 units but with substantial variability.\n\nOR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 49 units. OR uses the promised lead time and historical samples to compute a base-stock and caps the order. Its recommendation is a reasonable anchor but does not incorporate the most recent decline in realized demand and the fact we currently hold 35 units.\n\nDecision logic & tradeoffs: Profit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit per period -> critical fractile q = 0.5 (indifferent between one more unit and one less). That implies targeting median/mean demand without large safety stock. Because lead time = 0, ordering to meet the expected single-period demand is appropriate: desired on-hand \u2248 expected demand (~68). With 35 on-hand, that implies ordering roughly 33 units. Ordering OR's 49 would create a larger buffer (on-hand \u2248 84) which increases holding cost with little extra expected profit given equal profit/holding costs and no strong evidence of a sustained surge.\n\nFinal action: Order 35 units. This brings expected on-hand to ~70 (35 existing + 35 arriving), aligning with the recent average demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit = $1/unit, implying a critical fractile of 0.5 (OR's policy would put zero safety stock formally).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: The full history shows substantial variability, but recent demand has softened relative to some earlier high periods. The last 5 realized demands (Periods 32\u201336) are: 105, 37, 71, 41, 77. Their mean = 66.2 units. Using a short look-back is appropriate because OR uses all history equally and may be overweighting older high-demand periods; with lead time = 0 we can respond immediately to current demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to OR recommendation: OR recommends 84 units (based on long-run historical mean and its cap). With holding cost equal to profit, extra inventory is costly; since lead time is 0 we can safely order closer to expected current-period demand.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201339) repeatedly shows orders arriving the same period they were placed; carry-over insight already recorded: actual lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 40 and can be used to satisfy Period 40 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, ordered units are effectively added to on-hand for Period 40 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent realized demands are elevated relative to OR's low recommendation. Looking at the most recent periods (P35\u2013P39 demands = 41, 77, 69, 70, 59) the 5-period average \u2248 63. A slightly longer window (P32\u2013P39) shows many periods near 70\u201390. Historical practice in prior periods has maintained starting inventories near ~90\u201393 to avoid frequent stockouts. Given the volatility, using a target that covers a typical busy-day demand (~65\u201370) is prudent.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation vs. reality: OR recommends ordering 49 units (it uses a 0.5 critical fractile and the long-run mean). OR's estimate understates recent realized demand (recent mean \u224863) and ignores the operational preference evident in past periods to start near ~90 on-hand. Because profit = holding cost, the critical fractile is 0.5 (OR's logic), but real demand variance has recently skewed upward and stockouts have occurred when starting inventories were low.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final ordering decision and numbers: I will order 56 units. With on-hand 34 + order 56 = 90 available for Period 40 \u2014 matching the historical safe starting level many periods used (\u224890\u201393). This reduces the chance of stockout in a high-demand period while accepting some holding cost; with profit and holding cost equal, avoiding lost sales when demand is frequently >50 is preferable. This increases OR's 49 \u2192 56 to reflect the elevated recent demand and the fact we have zero pipeline.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk and monitoring: If Period 40 demand comes in lower, we will hold slightly more inventory (incurring holding cost equal to profit per unit). If subsequent periods show sustained lower demand for 3+ periods, I will scale back orders. Conversely, if demand remains high, this policy keeps service consistent.\n",

No outstanding in-transit inventory is shown (on-hand=0, in-transit=0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand picture: Historical demand across the game has clustered around ~80\u201395 units per period (early sample mean from the provided samples = 93 units; long-run period demands in the history consistently show many periods in the 70\u2013100 range). Recent periods (P36\u2013P41) demands were: 77,69,70,59,88,75 \u2014 averaging roughly mid-70s to low-80s. There is no evidence of a sustained regime shift or a calendar-driven spike requiring extra safety stock.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation and logic: OR recommends 83 units. OR uses promised lead time (0) and historical demand; because profit = holding cost ($1/$1) the critical fractile is 0.5, so OR's base-stock target is close to the demand mean. The OR cap dampens large swings; its recommendation of 83 matches the observed typical demand and is conservative relative to the long-run sample mean (~93).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory & risk tradeoffs: With profit = holding cost, over-ordering is costly (holding cost erodes profit equally).

{
  "rationale": "Summary of facts and inference: Actual lead time is confirmed 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4), so any order placed now will arrive during Period 48 and can satisfy Period 48 demand. Current visible inventory: on-hand = 18, in-transit = 0. OR recommended 63 units using its capped base-stock policy (which effectively targets the single-period mean when profit = holding cost).\n\nInventory & demand reasoning: Because lead time = 0, the order arrives in the same period and directly augments on-hand for immediate demand. Historical demand across many periods centers around roughly 70\u201390 units per period (visible sold quantities in the history frequently near ~80). With 18 on-hand, ordering 63 adds to ~81 available units, which aligns with the observed typical single-period demand without building excess inventory. Holding cost equals profit, so over-ordering is costly; the OR's capped policy already moderates order size.\n\nDecision and strategy: Follow the OR recommendation of 63 units. This provides roughly one period's expected demand coverage when combined with current on-hand (18+63 \u2248 81), avoids excess holding cost given profit = holding, and leverages the confirmed zero lead time so the order will immediately reduce stockout risk this period. No new sustained regime shift or lead-time change is detected in the concluded history, so no carry-over insight update is recorded.\n\nImplementation notes: Because orders arrive same period, this order will be consumed in Period 48 demand resolution if needed and its arrival will be reported in the Period 48 conclude message (visible next period) confirming continued lead-time = 0.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201348) confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period and that is already captured in carry-over). There are currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, so any order placed now will arrive during this same current period's arrival resolution (and will be available to meet this period's demand, per the 0 lead time).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: OR recommends 81 units using the full historical sample and the promised lead time. With profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the OR's base-stock reduces to the (1+L)-period mean demand; differences come from how OR estimates the mean (it uses all history). I inspected recent realized demand to detect any regime changes: the most recent five observed period demands (Periods 44\u201348) are 71, 54, 59, 75, 91 (mean = 70). Recent variability also appears moderate but not extreme.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Decision logic & adjustment: Because q=0.5 the optimal single-period order approximates the expected single-period demand. I lean toward giving more weight to recent demand (last 5 periods mean = 70) rather than the long-run mean implied by OR (81) because (a) there is a clear short-run drop relative to some earlier high-demand periods, (b) lead time is confirmed 0 so we can react quickly next period if demand rebounds, and (c) holding cost equals profit so overstock is as costly as a lost sale. With no pipeline and on-hand=0, order should be roughly the expected demand for one period. I therefore reduce OR's recommendation from 81 to 70 units to better match recent realized demand while retaining the ability to respond next period thanks to zero lead time.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk & operational note: Because lead time = 0, ordering less than OR's long-run suggestion is low risk\u2014the machine can top up next period if demand picks up. If we saw a sustained change (3+ periods) in either direction, I would record a carry-over insight; current recent variation is not a multi-period, high-confidence regime shift beyond normal noise.\n\nFinal action: order 70 units (arrives same period).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 81\u219270 units because with lead time confirmed 0 we should follow recent realized demand (last 5 periods mean = 70); lower order avoids equal-cost holding risk and we can react next period if demand changes.",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time and arrivals: Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201349) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed; carry-over insight already recorded lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 50 and be available to meet Period 50 demand (though arrival will only be visible in the Period 50 conclude message). There are no in-transit units.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Objective and cost trade-off: Profit per unit sold = $1; holding cost per unit end-of-period = $1. Because profit and holding cost are equal, the critical fractile q = 0.5 (OR's policy would target mean demand with no safety stock). This environment strongly penalizes carrying excess end-of-period inventory (holding cost cancels profit), so we should avoid systematic overstock and aim to match expected period demand closely.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand forecast (period 50): Use recent realized demands to estimate current single-period demand. Recent demands (Periods 46\u201349) = [59, 75, 81, 45] \u2192 recent mean \u2248 65. Across longer history demand fluctuates but centers near ~70. Given no clear sustained regime shift and the q=0.5 preference to avoid safety stock, a conservative expected demand estimate of 70 units for this period balances recent variability without adding extra safety stock.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory check and order sizing: On-hand = 25, in-transit = 0, expected demand \u2248 70. With lead time 0 the order will arrive and can be used this period. To meet expected demand without intentional overstock, order = max(0, expected_demand \u2212 on_hand) = max(0, 70 \u2212 25) = 45 units.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Comparison to OR recommendation and justification: OR recommended 56 units (based on a longer-history base-stock cap). I reduce that to 45 because (a) with profit = holding cost we should avoid positive expected ending inventory, (b) recent demand average is slightly above 65 but below OR's implicit target, and (c) there is no evidence of an upcoming sustained demand spike requiring extra safety stock. Ordering 45 brings available inventory to ~70 units to meet expected demand while minimizing holding cost risk.\n\nRisk note: If actual demand exceeds 70 substantially, we will stockout and lose potential profit; however given equal profit/holding cost and no confirmed regime shift, minimizing expected end-of-period holding cost is the right conservative choice.",
