Period 1 (Period_1) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar/product: No calendar dates or special events beyond Period_1; product is a staple snack (chips) so demand is driven by baseline footfall, no seasonal spike indicated. \n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Use historical samples provided for chips(Regular): Period_1=61, P2=107, P3=84, P4=144, P5=69. Mean demand = 93 units/period (sum 465/5). Variability is moderate, but no sustained upward or downward shift is evident in these five points. \n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but we have no conclude history to confirm actual lead time. Since no concluded arrivals exist, assume order placed now may arrive in the same period (promised 0) but be conservative that actual lead time could be longer; however there is no evidence of lost shipments yet. \n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. We must cover current period demand (decision happens before arrivals). Ordering now with promised lead_time=0 would arrive during this period before demand, but because actual lead time is unconfirmed, we keep the order size focused on expected demand rather than stocking excess.\n\ne) Final order logic: Use a newsvendor-style tradeoff. Profit per unit sold = $4 (underage cost), holding cost per unsold unit per period = $1 (overage cost). Critical ratio = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Apply to expected demand \u2248 93 \u2192 target order \u2248 0.8 * 93 = 74.4 \u2248 74 units. This balances service level against high holding costs. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, place order for 74 units to cover the bulk of expected demand while limiting excess inventory risk.",

This confirms the supplier can deliver within the same period (arrival will occur after we place an order this period). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 15, In-transit = 0.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar/product: No calendar date or seasonal event indicated for Period_3 and the product is a non-seasonal convenience SKU (regular chips). No special events to expect. \n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Concluded arrivals in Periods 1 and 2 show actual lead_time = 0 (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived the same period). Observed sales: Period 1 sold 59, Period 2 sold 75. Simple average = 67 units; recent trend shows an increase from 59 -> 75, so a forecast near 67\u201370 is reasonable for Period 3. With only two periods of data this is noisy, so I use the recent mean as the best estimate.\n\nc) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Both prior orders arrived same period (P1 and P2), so treat actual lead_time as 0 for planning (orders placed now will arrive in-period before demand). No evidence of lost shipments or extended lead times.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 32, in-transit = 0. Forecast demand ~67\u201370 for Period 3.

{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar/product: No calendar date or seasonal event indicated for Period_4 and product is a non-seasonal snack (chips).

Concluded demands: Period1 demand=59, Period2 demand=75, Period3 demand=131 (note Period3 had stockout: sold 67, demand reported 131). Average of these three observed demands = (59+75+131)/3 = 88.3. Period3 shows a clear upward spike and produced a large lost-sales amount (64 units), which suggests tail risk of higher demand.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded messages show orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all arrived in the same period (arrived with lead_time = 0). That confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (orders placed now will arrive in time for current-period demand).\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With confirmed lead_time = 0, we can replenish for Period_4 demand immediately. Period3 stockout indicates a risk of understocking; we should target a higher service level to avoid lost sales because profit per sold unit ($4) exceeds holding cost per period ($1), so the penalty for a missed sale (lost $4 profit) is larger than the one-period holding cost of an extra unit ($1).\n\ne) Final order logic: Forecast central estimate \u2248 88 units, but to reduce stockout risk shown in Period3 and given favorable profit vs holding cost, order a cushion above the mean. I choose to order 120 units to satisfy likely demand spikes while accepting some holding cost if demand is lower. With lead_time=0 this will arrive for Period_4 demand.\n",

Marginal underage cost (lost profit) = $4/unit, overage cost = $1/unit, so critical fractile = 4/(4+1)=0.8.
