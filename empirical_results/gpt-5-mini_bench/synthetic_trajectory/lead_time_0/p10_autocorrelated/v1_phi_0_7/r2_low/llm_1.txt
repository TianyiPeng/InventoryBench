No evidence of an abrupt regime shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time; therefore treat same-period arrival as possible but uncertain. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no coverage for current period demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so carrying inventory into future periods erodes expected margin; avoid excess stock. e) Final order logic: Aim to match expected demand for the upcoming (current) selling period while minimizing ending inventory because holding cost negates profit on units not sold. Using the 5-period average demand (~86.4), I order 86 units to cover the current period's forecasted demand while limiting leftover holding cost and exposure to uncertain lead-time/lost-order risk.",

The single confirmed demand in P1 (103) is likely noisy; with limited data I use a conservative forecast near 100 units for the upcoming period.\nc) Lead time / missing orders: The P1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 with lead_time=0. That is one observation of LT=0 but is not yet sustained evidence (needs 3+ periods). I will assume LT=0 for the next arrival decision but remain cautious.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No arrivals are visible for P2 at decision time. Because LT appears to be 0 (orders arrive same period), an order placed now can satisfy P2 demand. Holding cost equals profit ($1 each), so overstock is costly; prefer to avoid heavy safety stock.\ne) Final order logic: Target to meet expected P2 demand while minimizing leftover inventory.

This confirms supplier actual lead time = 0 (evidence below). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 at decision time. With lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive during Period_4 before demand. e) Order logic: Profit per unit = $1; holding cost = $1 per unit per period. Holding cost equals profit, so carrying any ending inventory into next period erodes expected reward (it costs as much to hold a unit as you earn selling it), thus I should avoid overstock. Given recent true demand (103,117,118) and a slight upward trend, target Period_4 demand \u2248 118\u2013120. To meet expected demand while minimizing leftover inventory, I will order 120 units now; they will arrive this period to satisfy demand. Numerical trade-off: ordering 120 aims to capture expected sales (~118) while accepting at most a small expected ending inventory (\u22482 units) rather than understocking and losing profitable sales.

To avoid lost sales given the recent upward demand (especially P4=152) I target supply sufficient to meet likely Period 5 demand while being conservative about overstock.

Inventory economics: Profit = $1/unit sold, Holding cost = $1/unit/period. Because profit and holding cost are equal, carrying excess ending inventory costs as much as the profit a sale would earn; optimal policy is to match expected sales closely to on-hand + arrivals to avoid both stockouts and excess ending inventory. Execution timing: with lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive before demand is realized this period, so it can be used to meet Period 42 demand.
