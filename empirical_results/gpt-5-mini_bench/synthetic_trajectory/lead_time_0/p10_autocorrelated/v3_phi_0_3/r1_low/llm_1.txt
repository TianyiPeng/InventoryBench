No in-transit inventory or missing shipments are observed. Thus actual lead time is confirmed 0 and orders placed now will arrive during Period_5 and be available to satisfy Period_5 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so nothing available to meet Period_5 demand until our order arrives this period.

No evidence of lost shipments in history; in-transit = 0.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 23, in-transit = 0. With lead_time=0, any order placed this decision phase will arrive in time for Period_7 demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so leftover ending inventory is as punitive as foregoing one unit of profit next period.

Longer-run demand centers around ~90\u2013110 with occasional spikes. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201342) consistently show orders arriving same period they were placed; lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. There are no in-transit or overdue shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive in this period and can satisfy Period_43 demand.

Therefore order 100 units to meet expected Period_43 demand while minimizing expected end-of-period inventory.",

Using a longer horizon (P1\u2013P44) gives similar central tendency but recent 8-period average better captures the current regime. \n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Carry-over insight confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any order placed this decision phase will arrive in time to satisfy Period_45 demand.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals unit profit = $1/unit.
