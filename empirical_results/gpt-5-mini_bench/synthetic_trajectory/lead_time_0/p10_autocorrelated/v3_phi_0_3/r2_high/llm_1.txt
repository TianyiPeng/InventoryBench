With only these five samples there is no confirmed sustained shift. c) Lead-time vs missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown; no concluded arrivals exist yet so we cannot confirm actual lead time or lost shipments. Orders placed now may or may not arrive within this same period. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so unless orders arrive this period we cannot meet period demand. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is small relative to profit ($19/unit), so over-ordering has limited per-period penalty compared to lost sales. e) Final order logic: Use the historical average demand (~118) as the baseline for one-period demand, add modest safety given variance. Because lead time is uncertain but supplier promised same-period arrival, we place an order large enough to cover expected demand plus safety (140 units). If actual lead time turns out >0 and this order doesn't arrive this period, we will observe that in the conclude message and adjust in future periods. This choice balances expected sales capture (high profit) against modest holding cost exposure.",

Use the higher end to avoid stockouts given high profit. \nc) Lead time / arrivals: Period conclusions show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time was 0).
