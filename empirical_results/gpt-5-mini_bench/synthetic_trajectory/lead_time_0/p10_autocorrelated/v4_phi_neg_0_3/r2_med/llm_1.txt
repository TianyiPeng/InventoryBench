Because demand for the current period occurs after our decision and promised lead time is 0, ordering is necessary to serve Period_1 demand. e) Final order logic: Aim to cover one period of expected demand while limiting excess holding cost.

These imply true demand around ~98\u2013100 units; using the two concluded-periods gives an expected demand \u2248 98 units for Period 3. c) Lead time / orders: Concluded history shows orders in P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived same period). No evidence of lost or delayed shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Because promised lead_time=0 and prior arrivals were 0, an order placed now should arrive in this period and be available to satisfy Period 3 demand. e) Order logic: Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1 per unit/period.

No in-transit shipments or overdue orders to consider. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0; with confirmed lead_time=0, any order placed this decision phase will arrive in time for Period 44 demand. e) Final order logic: Balance service level vs. holding cost. Profit per sold unit = $4; holding cost = $1 per unit per period. Expected demand \u2248 98 units; given recent high variability and a large spike at P43 (136), I add minimal buffer but avoid excessive holding cost. Ordering to match expected demand minimizes expected leftover while capturing most sales. Therefore I order 100 units for Period 44.",

To balance service level and avoid excess holding cost, I order roughly the recent average demand (rounded to an integer).
