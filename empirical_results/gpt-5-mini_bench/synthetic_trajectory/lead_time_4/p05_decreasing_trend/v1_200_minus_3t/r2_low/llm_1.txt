With promised LT=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders arrive after decision and demand occurs this period. e) Order logic: target coverage = 5 periods \xd7 182 = 910 units. However high holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so carrying inventory longer than necessary destroys margin. To balance service vs holding and given uncertainty in actual LT, I order a reduced quantity equal to the expected demand over the next 1+4=5 periods but scaled to the period average (rounded). Place 182 units now to begin pipeline while avoiding excessive holding risk; this provides one period's worth visible when arrivals confirm LT before placing further replenishment.",
