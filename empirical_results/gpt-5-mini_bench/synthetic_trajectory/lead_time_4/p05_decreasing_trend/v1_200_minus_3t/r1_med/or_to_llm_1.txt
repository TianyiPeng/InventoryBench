Recent realized demand is much lower than the early-sample mean used by OR: historical training mean (Periods1-5) = 182 units/period, while recent demands (Periods 41-49) average ~77 units/period. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand; 5 \xd7 recent mean \u2248 385 units. On-hand 325 covers most of that; using a slightly conservative forecast, current stock already materially covers the next lead-time horizon. OR's capped base-stock (recommendation=214) is driven by older high mean and empirical variance; placing that order would create excessive holding cost given observed lower demand. Given holding cost = $1/period and profit = $4, extra inventory is costly to carry. Therefore I will not replenish this period (order=0) to let on-hand run down toward the new lower demand regime before ordering again.
