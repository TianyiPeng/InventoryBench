Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory=0. Decision: follow OR and order 238 units now. Reasoning: OR's cap prevents an excessively large immediate order (which would tie up inventory and violate the capped policy), and with no evidence of lead-time deviation, lost shipments, or a regime shift (need 3+ periods to confirm), the OR's capped recommendation balances service and variability appropriately. Operationally, ordering 238 gives a buffer for near-term demand while avoiding large holding cost exposure and preserves flexibility until we can observe concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time.
