Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history (P5\u2013P38 arrivals) confirms actual lead time = 4 periods, matching promised L=4. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 279, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand since the documented regime shift (Periods ~36\u201349) averages ~20\u201330 units/period (P46\u2013P49 = 11,18,28,25; avg \u224820.5). With L+1 = 5 periods coverage needed, expected demand over next 5 periods \u2248 20.5\xd75 \u2248 102 units. Current on-hand (279) already covers ~13\u201314 periods and far exceeds OR's implied base-stock need. Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit $4/unit, so excess inventory is costly to accumulate. OR recommended 86 units based on older/higher-demand history and promised lead time; given confirmed L=4 and sustained low-demand regime, ordering would create unnecessary holding cost and risk. Final strategy: place no order this period (0 units) to draw down existing ample inventory while monitoring demand; revisit ordering once on-hand approaches ~100 units or sustained demand rises.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Declining sustained demand (~20\u201330/day) and confirmed lead time=4 mean current on-hand (279) already covers ~5+ periods; I reduce OR's 86\u21920 to avoid holding costs and oversupply.",
