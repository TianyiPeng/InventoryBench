This is insufficient to conclude a lost shipment or an actual lead time different from the promised 4 periods (policy requires concluded arrivals after Period 1+4 to confirm). Do NOT record lead-time as changed.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand & pipeline assessment: Historical single-period mean from samples = (204+155+134+72+108)/5 = 134.6 \u2248135.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Period 9 conclude confirmed actual lead time = 4 (consistent with earlier carry-over). Therefore orders placed now will arrive in Period 53 and be visible in Period 54; we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand including current period. Demand assessment: recent realized demand (Periods 44\u201348 = 32,37,11,18,28) averages 25.2 units/period; this is well below the historical training mean and aligns with the previously recorded sustained low-demand regime starting Period 15. Inventory position: on-hand = 36, in-transit = 20 \u2192 pipeline_inventory = 56. Five-period demand forecast \u2248 5 \xd7 25.2 = 126. Order calculation: target pipeline (5-period coverage) \u2248 126, so order_raw = 126 \u2212 56 = 70. Risk adjustments: OR recommended 129 based on historical mean and promised lead time; I reduce that because recent regime shows substantially lower demand (\u224825/day) and we already have moderate pipeline, so a smaller replenishment reduces holding costs while covering expected demand over the lead+review horizon.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods (carry-over). Demand: recent 5-period average (P45\u2013P49) = (37+11+18+28+25)/5 = 23.8 units/period. Forecast over (L+1)=5 periods \u2248 119 units. Inventory coverage: on-hand 31 + in-transit 70 = 101 units, leaving a shortfall \u2248 18 units to cover next 5 periods. OR recommends 128 (uses historical high mean); given sustained lower-demand regime since Period 15 and very low recent demand, ordering to OR's level would create unnecessary holding cost. Decision: order 20 units (slightly above the 18-unit shortfall to provide minimal safety stock). This keeps pipeline+on-hand \u2248121, slightly above 5-period expected demand, limits holding costs ($1/unit/period) while avoiding imminent stockouts under current low-demand regime. Follow-up: monitor next concluded periods for demand reversal before increasing order sizes.",
