With L+1 = 5 periods, the pipeline should cover ~5\xd7single-period demand. Historical carry-over indicates sustained lower-demand regimes (most recent long-run averages ~56.6 or lower), so a conservative single-period demand assumption \u224855 implies 5-period demand \u2248275. Pipeline (175) leaves a shortfall \u2248100. OR recommends 199, but that would increase ending inventory and holding cost given evidence of lower demand and recent volatility. To balance stockout risk vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 gives q\u22480.8), I scale OR down while still replenishing most of the shortfall: order 140 units. That raises total pipeline+on-hand to 315 (175 + 140), covering ~5.7 periods at 55/day, providing a modest safety margin without excessive holding cost.
