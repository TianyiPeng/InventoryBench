Holding cost only applies to on-hand inventory after arrival, while profit per sold unit ($19) is large relative to holding ($1), so it's optimal to ensure enough units arrive to meet the next 5 periods of expected demand.

No three-period sustained anomaly yet, so assume promised lead time L=4 is reliable for now. Step 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand=191, in-transit=348 (pipeline total=348). Total available now+pipeline=539 units. Step 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent sold demand (Periods 5\u20138) = [138,114,165,146], average \u2248140 units/period; this is consistent with historical sample mean (~140). For L+1=5 periods, expected demand \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 5\xd7140 = 700 units. Step 4 \u2014 Compare to OR: OR recommends 167 units (uses promised L and historical stats). Pipeline (348) falls short of \u03bc\u0302 by \u2248352 units (700\u2212348). OR caps its order to smooth swings; its recommendation of 167 moves pipeline toward target while limiting large swings and holding cost exposure. Step 5 \u2014 Decision: Follow OR recommendation of 167 units. Rationale: demand appears stable around 140/period, pipeline+on-hand (539) already covers ~3.85 periods; ordering 167 is a conservative, capped refill that reduces stockout risk over the next lead-time horizon without creating excessive holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 - Lead time & pipeline: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4. Current visible inventory = on-hand 125 + in-transit 443 = 568 units in pipeline. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand from pipeline+order. Step 2 - Demand estimate: Recent realized demands (Periods 14-18 = 140,117,125,98,114) average \u2248 118.8 \u2248 119 per period \u2192 5-period demand \u2248 595 units. Pipeline (568) is short \u2248 27 units for the next 5 periods. Step 3 - OR baseline: OR recommends 162 (derived from longer-run mean \u03bc\u0304=136.4 and safety stock), which would raise pipeline well above base_stock derived from historical earlier samples. OR uses older samples that imply a higher mean (\u2248136) and larger safety stock (base_stock \u2248 747), producing order_raw \u2248 179 and capped order \u2248165. Step 4 - Assessment & decision: Recent realized demand is materially lower (~119 vs OR's assumed 136), so immediately ordering 162 would create unnecessary excess inventory (holding cost $1/unit/period) while only marginally increasing sales. However, pipeline is slightly short (~27 units) relative to the next 5 periods. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I will place a small corrective order to cover the shortfall plus a modest safety buffer. Step 5 - Final action sizing: Order = 30 units. This brings pipeline to 598 units (568+30), slightly above the 5-period expected demand (595) while avoiding the large inventory OR's recommendation would create. Step 6 - Monitoring: Continue to watch concluded arrivals and demand over the next 3+ periods; if lower demand persists, reduce future orders; if demand climbs toward OR's historical mean, resume larger orders. Numerical summary: pipeline before order = 568, 5-period demand \u2248 595 (gap \u2248 27) \u2192 order 30 to cover gap + small buffer. ",
