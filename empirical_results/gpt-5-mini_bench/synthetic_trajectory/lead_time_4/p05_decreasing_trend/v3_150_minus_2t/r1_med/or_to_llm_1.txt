OR baseline computed a capped order recommendation of 152 units (uses safety stock and cap to limit variability). Decision: follow OR recommendation of 152 units. Reasoning: confirmed lead time = 4 means we must cover 5 periods; current total inventory leaves a material shortfall (~130). OR\u2019s recommendation modestly exceeds that shortfall to provide safety stock consistent with the profit/holding cost tradeoff (q=0.8 \u2192 z*\u22480.84) and the OR cap; ordering 152 balances stockout risk and holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline and stable historical demand.

Timing/feasibility: Orders placed now will arrive during Period 50 (the last period of the horizon) due to 4-period lead time, so they only affect sales in Period 50. With 4 periods of demand remaining before new arrivals, current on-hand + scheduled in-transit (392) must absorb demand through Period 49; the new order only protects Period 50. Decision trade-off: Without ordering, we risk being short in Period 50 given expected remaining total demand \u2248682 and current pipeline 392 (short \u2248290). Ordering the OR-capped amount (~161) partially closes that gap while respecting OR's cap (which stabilizes ordering when pipeline is low). Holding cost is $1/unit/period and only 5 periods remain, so moderate additional holding from this order is acceptable relative to lost profit ($4) from unmet demand.
