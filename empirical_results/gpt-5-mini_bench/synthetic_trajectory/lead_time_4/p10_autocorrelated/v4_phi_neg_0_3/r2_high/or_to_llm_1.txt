My assessment: With no evidence of lost shipments or shorter/longer lead time and no recent regime/seasonality signals, the OR baseline correctly balances stockout risk (high profit, low holding cost) against pipeline smoothing. Increasing beyond OR's cap would create excessive immediate pipeline relative to the policy intent and could mask future signals; decreasing risks stockouts given high profit.
