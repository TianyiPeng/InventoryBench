With high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) the service bias favors stocking, but we are already above a conservative forecast based on recent demand.\nRisk assessment: Ordering additional units now will raise holding cost each period on top of already-excess pipeline; there is no confirmed upcoming seasonality or event to justify increases. No evidence of lost shipments in recent concluded messages. Given confirmed lead time=4, any order placed now arrives after 4 periods\u2014too late to affect near-term lower demand and will further increase excess inventory.\nDecision rule applied: Compare pipeline (511) to expected (L+1)-period demand under a recent-demand estimate (\u2248417).
