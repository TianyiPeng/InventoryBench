Historical single-period demand: mean=116, sd\u224825.25; OR computed 107 but uses promised L and its own cap. Inventory position: on-hand=254, in-transit=168 \u2192 pipeline=422. OR's base-stock (5-period demand) target \u2248627.5, giving order_raw\u2248205.5 and cap\u2248157.6. Interpretation: the 5-period expected demand is \u2248580, so pipeline is short by \u2248158 units relative to OR's target. However: only 3 periods remain in the game (Period 48 of 50), so future demand to satisfy before the horizon is at most 3\xd7116\u2248348 (not the 5-period horizon OR optimizes for). Ordering now would arrive after 4 periods (outside or at end of horizon) and incur holding costs for remaining periods \u2014 plus arrivals won't be usable in time to sell before the game ends. Given long lead time (4) and short remaining horizon, additional orders are unlikely to convert into sales and will increase holding-cost penalties. Decision: place zero order. This minimizes ending inventory growth and avoids ordering goods that arrive too late to sell. I therefore override OR's recommendation and order 0 units.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & pipeline: Carry-over insight confirms actual lead time = 4. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 168 (these 168 were ordered in Period 46 and will arrive during Period 50 arrival resolution). Step 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Historical sample mean = 116 units/period (samples: 75,138,134,122,111). 5-period demand \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd7116 = 580. Sample std dev \u224825.25 \u2192 \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a5\xd725.25 \u224856.5. Step 3 \u2014 OR baseline check: OR's capped policy produced ~155 units (cap \u2248157.6, base_stock \u2248627.6, pipeline-adjusted order_raw \u2248459.6 \u2192 capped to \u2248157.6). OR uses promised L and historical stats; its cap prevents extreme single-period swings. Step 4 \u2014 Operational consideration: New orders placed now will arrive in Period 54 (N+4). The current in-transit 168 will be available to meet imminent demand (arriving this period). To avoid large holding costs from excess inventory over many periods, I prefer to follow the OR capped recommendation rather than ordering the full base-stock shortfall (which would create heavy carrying cost). Step 5 \u2014 Decision: Place order = 155 units (close to OR cap). This balances risk of short-term stockout against holding cost given historical mean demand 116 and the substantial in-transit of 168. If demand spikes persist for multiple periods, future periods should increase orders, but given current evidence I will adopt OR's capped recommendation.",
