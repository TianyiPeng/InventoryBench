(2) No sustained signal (>=3 periods) of lead-time change or demand regime shift to justify a larger override.

These will arrive in future periods (first arrival next period is from P14 orders; P14 ordered 0, so no arrival this period). On-hand=0 so current-period demand will face a stockout regardless of new order (new order would arrive in Period 22).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Use historical sample mean \u03bc\u0304 = (80+120+120+93+177)/5 = 118 units/period. Required coverage = (L+1)*\u03bc\u0304 = 5*118 = 590 units to cover current + next 4 periods.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare pipeline to requirement: pipeline_inventory = in-transit = 461. Uncapped order_raw = 590 \u2212 461 = 129 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation: OR suggests 43 (capped). OR under-orders relative to (L+1)-period coverage because of its cap. Given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) the objective is to cover expected demand; preventing lost sales is priority since holding cost equals profit but unmet demand loses revenue. Pipeline is short by 129 units to reach the 5-period expected demand cover.\n\nDecision: Order 129 units to bring pipeline + order up to expected (L+1)-period demand (590).
