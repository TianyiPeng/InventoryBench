Therefore I order \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 429 units to cover the expected 5-period demand. This departs from OR's cap (128) which would leave the vend empty through multiple periods; the larger order accepts modest holding cost to capture likely profitable sales and stabilize service across the long lead time.
