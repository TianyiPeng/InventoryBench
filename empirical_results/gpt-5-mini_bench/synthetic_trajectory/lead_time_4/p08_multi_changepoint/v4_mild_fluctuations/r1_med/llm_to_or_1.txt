Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p08_multi_changepoint\v4_mild_fluctuations\r1_med\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 84), ('Period_2', 55), ('Period_3', 79), ('Period_4', 85), ('Period_5', 126)]
  Mean: 85.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; promised lead time (4) used. Historical demand samples available (84,55,79,85,126) will be used by backend; I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample statistics given no evidence of a regime shift or delayed/lost shipments. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively for initial period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2. Recent demand samples for chips(Regular) show moderate demand (historical samples available). On-hand=0, in-transit=128 from an order placed Period_1 that has not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 this suggests a delayed shipment but not enough evidence to confirm lead-time change. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4 periods) so the OR backend assumes standard L; mu_hat default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sigma_hat default to capture sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the backend's forecast anchored to full-sample statistics while the in-transit order provides pipeline cover if it eventually arrives; defaults avoid overreacting to a single missed arrival while still letting the optimizer balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. Historical demand samples (all periods): mean=85.8, std\u224822.87. On-hand=0, in-transit=255 which covers ~3.0 periods but (1+L)=5 periods demand \u2248429 \u2192 pipeline shortfall. Two concluded periods show arrived=0 for prior orders but promised lead time is 4 and there is insufficient evidence to revise lead-time. To ensure the OR backend sizes orders to cover review+lead demand and because no sustained changepoint is detected, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This increases orders to replenish the short pipeline while letting the OR engine trade off profit vs holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (sum of orders from P1-P3); no concluded arrivals observed so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Use default lead time (promised=4). Demand history (samples provided) average = 85.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples). This keeps orders sized to cover the full (L+1) review+lead horizon while the pipeline is still expected to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5): [84,55,79,85,126]; on-hand=0, in-transit=453. No 'arrived' confirmations in any concluded periods (Periods 1-4 concluded show arrived=0 for orders placed), so actual lead time is unobserved. I use L default (promised lead time = 4) because there is no concluded evidence to compute an empirical lead time. I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service level using full sample history while the large in-transit inventory already provides coverage against demand during the lead window and mitigates risk from potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals confirmed: Orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered=128,127,123,75) each show arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2014 4 consecutive periods with no concluded arrivals, suggesting delayed or lost shipments for those orders.

Daily Profit: $336.00, Daily Holding Cost: $44.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision: on-hand=44, in-transit=331. Historical demand samples (Periods1-5): [84,55,79,85,126], mean=85.8. We have one concluded arrival showing an actual lead time of 4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend confirm average actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level (profit=4 vs hold=1) while acknowledging current in-transit pipeline; we avoid aggressive increases to mu_hat until more lead-time arrivals confirm any loss/delay pattern for other in-transit orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5, implying lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). On-hand=115, in-transit=286 (these arrivals likely include earlier delayed shipments). Demand history (periods 1-5): [84,55,79,85,126], mean=85.8. To reflect confirmed lead time and stable demand sample, set L by observed average, and use default population-based forecasts for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) without overreacting to the single high demand in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1\u2013P3 arrived after 4 periods). Current on-hand=153, in-transit=208 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but we must respect 4-period lead. I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead-times. Demand shows no sustained dramatic shift; recent 5-period mean is lower than earliest samples, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (captures current demand ~78/unit). These parameters bias orders toward servicing (L+1)=5 periods of recent demand while limiting excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand mixed (periods 5-8: 84,56,85,115). On-hand=113, in-transit=191; previous conclude messages confirm actual lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods1-4. No sustained demand regime shift detected (needs 3+ consistent periods). To reflect confirmed lead time while relying on full-sample demand statistics, I set L by calculating observed lead times and use default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This provides a stable base-stock covering review+lead period and avoids overreacting to recent noisy fluctuations while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 decision. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). Current inventory: on-hand=31, in-transit=305. (1+L)=5 periods of coverage needed. Recent demand appears higher since Period_5; last 5 demands (P5\u2013P9) = [84,56,85,115,88], mean = 85.6. To capture the recent regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoid stockouts, set L by calculating observed lead time and set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods. This biases orders to cover the higher recent demand while the OR backend will apply service-level caps to limit over-ordering.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=74, in-transit=343; pipeline appears healthy with past delayed arrivals resolved and no new unexplained losses. I set L to calculate to lock in the observed lead time=4 from concluded messages. I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures base demand and variability across the review+lead horizon) balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: confirmed recent actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals consistently show orders placed at Period t arriving at t+4). On-hand=43, in-transit=331 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand so avoid over-ordering. Demand samples provided (84,55,79,85,126) show mean ~85.8. Use default lead time (promised=4) to align with confirmed observations and because arrivals have been consistent at L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while respecting the large existing pipeline and avoiding extra orders that would raise holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers upcoming demand given large in-transit volume. Use lead-time estimate informed by observed arrivals; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of available demand samples, allowing OR engine to compute base stock and cap with current promised L.

Daily Profit: $376.00, Daily Holding Cost: $50.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=50, in-transit=301. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Pipeline (301) plus on-hand covers multiple periods of demand; no recent evidence of lost shipments beyond the previously confirmed pattern. I therefore set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed L=4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, giving a balanced base-stock that accounts for the 5-period review+lead horizon and the observed demand variability while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=75, in-transit=278. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving after 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), confirming actual lead time=4 and that prior apparent missing arrivals were delayed but later concluded. I set L explicitly to 4 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine sizes orders for the correct pipeline length. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed L and current pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=53, in-transit=343. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6,... P11->P15). Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 76,77,94,95,55) shows a moderately higher mean than earliest samples; to capture current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecast scaled by (1+L)=5. sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. Using default lead time (promised=4, matches observed concludes) keeps arrivals aligned with confirmed behavior and prevents over/under-ordering given outstanding pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=302. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P12 that concluded arrived with W=4). Recent demand has variability but no sustained regime change (last high demand in P16 is single period). Given confirmed 4-period actual lead time and no evidence of a new demand regime, use lead-time estimate from observed data and default demand pooling over all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps target base-stock aligned with confirmed lead time while avoiding overreacting to a single high-demand period; it also leverages the in-transit inventory to avoid excessive ordering amid potential lost/delayed shipments.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: demand history (Period1-5 samples mean=85.8) and conclude history show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2192P5 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=350 (covers multi-period demand). Given confirmed 4-period lead time, set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to reflect full-sample demand estimate and let OR backend compute safety stock facing L=4. This balances service (profit>holding) while avoiding excessive explicit increases given no new sustained demand regime.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: on-hand=2, in-transit=366, profit=4, holding=1. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P14 that concluded indicate 4). Pipeline (366) plus on-hand likely covers several periods of demand, but recent demands have ranged high; to be conservative use inferred lead time from observations. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (stability preferred given no recent sustained demand regime change). This balances service (use observed L) versus holding cost by letting OR engine compute safety via profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand has risen and become more volatile (recent 5 demands: 133,95,95,166,115; mean=120.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=459 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals delayed historically). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (last 5 periods) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility; this raises the target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while the OR backend caps orders. This choice balances service (reduce stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Demand history (seed samples) mean = 85.8; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (from concluded messages). On-hand=14, in-transit=506 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple lead periods. Use promised/confirmed lead time and aggregate-demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap using full-sample stats. Methods chosen: L=default to use promised 4 (confirmed by history), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (stable seed mean), sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This favors standard service-level calibration while avoiding overfitting to recent fluctuations; given large in-transit inventory, this will prevent excessive new ordering.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: recent demand elevated vs initial samples (last 5 demands = 95,166,115,109,97; mean=116.4). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders repeatedly arrived after 4 periods) and current pipeline is large (on-hand=30, in-transit=393) with earlier missing-arrival episodes resolved. To prioritize service with current high demand I set L by calculation (use observed lead times), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the current higher regime while the cap will limit order size against the large pipeline, mitigating risk from overdue/lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24. On-hand=41, in-transit=461. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals = orders placed 4 periods earlier (lead_time=4 confirmed across many observations) and no recent signs of lost shipments. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time (captures confirmed LT=4). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this is conservative given no clear recent demand regime shift and preserves the backend's capped ordering behavior to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period_26. Recent confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (observed arrivals consistently show lead_time=4). Current on-hand=3, in-transit=307 (pipeline=310 total) vs. implied (1+L)-period demand: (1+4)*mean(samples)=5*85.8=429 units \u2014 pipeline is short vs. expected demand, so keep forecast horizon at L=4 and let OR backend compute order-up-to based on full-sample statistics to restore coverage. Chosen methods: L by calculate to use observed lead times; mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given confirmed LT=4) against holding cost by using the backend's capped ordering rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 start. Recent history shows high and volatile demand with ending on-hand=0 and in-transit=456. Concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 (many orders observed with lead_time=4), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. On-hand + pipeline (456) should cover upcoming periods but a recent arrived=0 (Period 26) suggests occasional missing shipments\u2014we keep conservative demand forecast by using default demand/volatility aggregation across all samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR backend sets base-stock using full-sample stats and the calculated L to balance service vs holding costs. No new sustained regime change to record.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=54, in-transit=387. Recent history shows lead time consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4); a single zero-arrival at Period 26 is isolated and not yet a sustained loss signal. Pipeline (387) + on-hand (54) provides coverage for upcoming demand; use default estimates so OR backend uses promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Using default L/mu_hat/sigma_hat keeps parameters conservative given confirmed LT=4 and no sustained new demand regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=499. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P23\u2192P27), though some recent orders (P26, P28) showed arrived=0 suggesting possible lost/delayed shipments. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empiric 4-period lead time. Demand forecasting uses the default (1+L)\xd7mean of provided samples to keep the OR engine's baseline estimate intact given no sustained recent demand regime shift. Sigma uses default to reflect historical variability across samples. These choices prioritize restoring service (by using the confirmed lead time) while avoiding overreaction to a few missing arrivals; the OR backend's capped ordering will limit excessive orders and control holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Current on-hand=33, in-transit=407 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=440. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations), so I set L by calculation to reflect observed reality. Historical sample mean demand = 85.8 (periods 1-5); (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*85.8=429, so current pipeline roughly matches the target coverage for (L+1) periods. Using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute base-stock and caps from full-sample stats while L=calculate ensures observed lead time is used to align ordering with true arrivals. No new sustained changepoint beyond previously recorded lead-time behavior or intermittent missed arrivals.

Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period lead time for delivered shipments, with occasional missing arrivals earlier; pipeline currently large relative to historical mean demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping target base-stock aligned with long-run demand while letting the capped policy limit order size given observed pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent demand has averaged ~100-120 units with occasional spikes to ~160-170. On-hand=54, in-transit=376; pipeline is large relative to on-hand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many orders with arrived tags indicating 4 periods). Early missing arrivals were transient and subsequent periods confirm LT=4. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed lead time and current large pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. On-hand=63, in-transit=387. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4); earlier missing arrivals occurred but later concluded, so use observed lead time. I select L=calculate to let backend use average observed lead times (reflects confirmed 4). Demand forecasting uses defaults (mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default) to apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, providing a neutral baseline given no recent sustained demand regime change. This balances service (profit/holding tradeoff) while acknowledging pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=440, recent conclude history shows consistent arrived messages implying actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders observed with lead_time=4). Several earlier periods had missing arrivals but subsequent concludes confirm 4-period arrival for those orders. Given confirmed stable lead time and no clear sustained demand regime shift, I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture realized supplier behavior. I use default demand/volatility computations (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend uses full historical demand to balance service level (profit vs. stockouts) against holding cost while accounting for the confirmed lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35. On-hand=20, in-transit=444. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders observed arriving after 4 periods), and recent arrivals have resumed normally after earlier missing arrivals. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine anchored to the full demand history while using confirmed lead-time evidence; given profit $4 vs holding $1 (high target service level), defaults let the backend produce a higher base-stock while the L estimate ensures pipeline coverage for the 4-period lead time.

Daily Profit: $308.00, Daily Holding Cost: $28.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: observed demand samples show stable historical pattern; concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=28, in-transit=451 (pipeline large relative to typical (1+L) demand). Many earlier periods showed delayed/missing arrivals but recent conclude history confirms orders arrive with 4-period lead time. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (average of observed conclude lead_times). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which is appropriate given no sustained demand regime change detected; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. These choices rely on confirmed L=4 to ensure pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods and avoid over-ordering despite the large in-transit volume.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=56, in-transit=405. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (stable since Period 5/6). Demand samples provided (chips(Regular): 84,55,79,85,126) will be used as the demand seed. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm the empiric L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use the defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by letting the backend set the base-stock and cap using its analytic formulas while respecting the confirmed lead time and current healthy pipeline (405 in-transit). No new missing-shipment signal requiring explicit L adjustment is present.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Current on-hand=88, in-transit=381. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period lead time (many orders: ordered on Pn, arrived on Pn+4); recent missing-arrival episodes resolved into consistent 4-period arrivals. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time (captures confirmed L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative aggregate forecast given stable demand history and a high service target implied by profit/holding (profit $4, holding $1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 43: chips(Regular) profit=$4, holding=$1. On-hand=122, in-transit=362. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals at lag 4). No recent sustained demand regime shift detected. Using default lead time (promised) keeps L=4 (matches observed). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this leverages long-run demand data and the confirmed L while letting the OR engine set the base-stock and cap to balance profit vs holding cost given stable demand and substantial pipeline coverage.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=148, in-transit=310. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time=4). Earlier missing arrivals were later confirmed as 4-period arrivals. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures confirmed L=4). For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast over the review+lead horizon. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and capping policy using the full-sample statistics while accounting for the confirmed lead time.

Use observed lead time so backend sizes review+lead demand correctly. No new sustained demand regime shift detected; use full-sample demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat to balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with the capped ordering policy.

Period_46. On-hand=126, in-transit=348. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (observed arrivals match orders placed 4 periods earlier). Pipeline + on-hand appears healthy but shipments have occasionally been delayed; given confirmed LT=4 I use calculated LT to reflect observed data. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples, providing a stable forecast; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 => target service high) against holding costs while respecting observed lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Current on-hand=93, in-transit=337 => pipeline covers upcoming demand for the 5-period coverage (1+L). I set L explicitly to 4 to reflect observed lead time. For demand I use default aggregation: mu_hat default -> (1+L)\xd7mean(all provided samples) (captures baseline demand from historical samples). Sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect observed variability scaled for the multi-period lead+review horizon. These choices align backend base-stock sizing with confirmed lead time while using pooled historical demand statistics to balance service level (profit-driven) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (multiple confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6, ... P43->P47), so use calculated average lead time. On-hand=72 + in-transit=389 gives healthy pipeline but no new sustained demand or LT shift detected; use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use observed L=4) vs holding cost by letting backend set base stock from pooled stats.

Use default lead time (promised) to align with observed pattern. Demand history (samples provided) mean=85.8 units; with L=4 the default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean captures 5-period demand (conservative cover for current pipeline). Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=71, in-transit=378. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (many orders arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Pipeline + on-hand (449 units) appears sufficient for near-term demand but some earlier shipments were delayed/lost historically; using a lead-time estimate derived from observed concludes is prudent. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 4-period lead time). For demand forecast I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) (uses full sample set), and for volatility I use 'default' so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std(all samples). These choices keep the OR backend aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time and the long-run demand statistics while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise or individual missing shipments.
