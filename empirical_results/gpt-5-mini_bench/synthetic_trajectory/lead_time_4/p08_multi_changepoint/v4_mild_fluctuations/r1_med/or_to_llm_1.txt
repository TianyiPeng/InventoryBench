{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over note from Period 6). Inventory position: on-hand=55, in-transit=350 (total pipeline+on-hand=405). Demand outlook: historical samples and carry-over insights show a sustained elevated demand regime (Periods 20\u201326 avg \u2248130). OR recommendation = 138 (uses promised L and historical demand). Decision logic: with lead time 4 we must plan for next L+1=5 periods of demand; at ~130/day that implies ~650 units needed to fully cover 5 periods, but current pipeline+on-hand is 405 so there is a shortfall. However ordering the full shortfall (\u2248245) risks large holding costs if demand or timing of arrivals differs; OR's capped policy already smooths ordering. Given substantial in-transit stock (350) that will arrive over upcoming periods and a high profit/higher but non-negligible holding cost (profit $4 vs holding $1), I accept OR's recommendation to avoid over-ordering and excessive ending inventory. Final action: order 138 units (follow OR).",
