Step 2 \u2014 Demand & OR math check: Historical mean demand = (130+122+106+108+71)/5 = 107.4 units/period.

Step 3 \u2014 Risk assessment & decision: With only one period concluded and an in-transit shipment of 145, there is insufficient evidence of lost/delayed shipments or regime shifts. The OR cap already tempers the large uncapped order. Given symmetric profit/holding (q=0.5) we avoid aggressive safety stock.
