Our pipeline (536) + on-hand (0) essentially matches that 5-period expected demand.

There is some downward trend in recent demand (Period 5 =71) but not yet a confirmed sustained regime shift. No concluded evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 117, in-transit = 334 \u2192 pipeline_inventory = 451. Demand outlook: historical training samples give single-period mean \u2248107.4; recent actual demands (P5\u2013P8 = 125,101,107,86) show no sustained regime shift (only short fluctuations), so continue using ~107/unit as demand expectation. OR baseline: OR computed cap-limited base-stock \u2192 recommended 142 units (consistent with base-stock math given \u03bc\u0302\u2248537 and \u03c3\u0302). Adjustment reasoning: with confirmed L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand; base-stock target \u2248620 vs current pipeline 451 leaves a shortfall of \u2248169. However, a large portion of pipeline (334) is already en route with staggered arrivals and holding cost is non-negligible ($1/unit/period). Recent demand has trended slightly down from P5 but not enough to declare a regime change. To balance stockout risk and holding cost, I scale OR down modestly to avoid unnecessary excess inventory while still replenishing pipeline: order 120 units (\u224815% below OR's 142). This still moves toward the base-stock target while limiting immediate holding cost exposure given already-large pipeline and no evidence of a sustained demand surge. Carry-over insight: none new.",
