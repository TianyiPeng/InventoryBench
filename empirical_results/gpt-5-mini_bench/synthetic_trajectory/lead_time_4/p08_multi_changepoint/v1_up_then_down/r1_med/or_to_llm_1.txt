Historical demand samples mean = 107.4 units/period; OR computed base-stock policy (using L=4) and recommends 140 units.

Profit per unit ($4) exceeds holding cost ($1), so it is preferable to keep some ordering to avoid future stockouts rather than zero order which risks lost profitable sales. Therefore I follow the OR recommendation (140 units) to top up the pipeline toward the base-stock target while remaining within the OR cap.
