Demand history shows a recent spike (P16=178, P17=168) but the long-run sample mean used by OR is ~107.4 and OR recommended 163 units.

However pipeline=360 already, and scheduled arrivals from recent orders will further replenish inventory in upcoming periods. Given high holding cost relative to demand uncertainty and large current pipeline, placing a large order now risks substantial holding cost before sales occur. Operational timing: orders placed now arrive after 4 periods (too late to influence immediate replenishment from in-transit shipments), and we will observe arrivals in the next conclude message \u2014 so we can delay ordering one period to incorporate confirmed arrivals.
