{
  "rationale": "World & product: chips(Regular) is a non-seasonal snack; recent periods show sustained high demand. Demand analysis: Periods 45\u201349 demands = [80,97,140,152,140], 5-period average \u2248 121.8 units/period. Lead time: confirmed repeatedly as 4 periods (historical arrivals show 4-period lead). Pipeline requirement: must cover L+1 = 5 future periods. Target pipeline = 5 \xd7 121.8 \u2248 610 units. Current coverage = on-hand (126) + in-transit (367) = 493 units. Shortfall \u2248 610 \u2212 493 = 117 units. Inventory policy: because profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), avoid excess inventory; order only the shortfall to meet expected demand over the lead-time horizon. Final action: order 117 units.",
