OR's math (for reference) gives base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 = 484 + 0.8416*47.36 \u2248 523.9, so uncapped order_raw \u2248 523.9 \u2212 471 = 52.9. Cap = \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + \u03a6\u22121(0.95)*\u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L) = 96.8 + 1.645*21.18 \u2248 131.6, so OR's capped policy would order \u224853 units. The provided OR recommendation (113) appears to come from a different history window; given current large pipeline (471) ordering that much would create unnecessary holding cost. Risk adjustment: there have been intermittent lost shipments (~4 instances historically) so pipeline reliability is imperfect, but loss rate (~10% of orders over long history) is not large enough to justify tripling orders when current pipeline already covers ~4.9 periods of expected demand (471 / 96.8 \u2248 4.87).
