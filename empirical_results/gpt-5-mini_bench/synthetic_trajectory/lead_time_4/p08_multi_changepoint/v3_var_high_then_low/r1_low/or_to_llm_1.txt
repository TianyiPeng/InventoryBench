Decision: do not order (0 units). Rationale: current in-transit of 484 already matches the base-stock target for a 5-period coverage (L+1), so placing additional units only increases holding cost without improving expected profit (profit per unit = holding cost per unit, yielding neutral risk preference).

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals), so use L=4. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=65, in-transit=334 \u2192 total available = 399 units currently committed. Demand outlook: historical sample mean ~96.8; recent periods (P42\u2013P49) average \u224891.8, and carry-over notes earlier regime shifts but no new sustained change since Period 42. With profit=holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock beyond expected demand. OR's capped base-stock recommendation (68) already accounts for L=4 demand aggregation and caps volatility; given our pipeline (399) vs. (L+1)*single-period mean \u22485*95\u2248475 there is a shortfall \u224876 units but OR's cap smooths ordering to avoid overstock given equal profit/holding. Adjustment: follow OR recommendation (68) to modestly top up pipeline while avoiding excessive holding cost, since recent demand is not convincingly higher and lead time is stable at 4. Final strategy: place order 68 to supplement in-transit inventory; monitor arrivals and demand next periods and update if a sustained demand shift emerges.",
