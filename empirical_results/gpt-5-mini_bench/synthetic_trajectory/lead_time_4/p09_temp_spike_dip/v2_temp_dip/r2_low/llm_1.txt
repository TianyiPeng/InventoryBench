Margin dynamics: profit per unit = $1 but holding cost = $1/period, so excess inventory severely penalized. Given substantial in-transit stock (238) that is likely to arrive across upcoming periods and the very high holding cost that discourages adding more pipeline that arrives after a 4-period lag, I avoid placing new orders this period and rely on current pipeline to satisfy demand.
