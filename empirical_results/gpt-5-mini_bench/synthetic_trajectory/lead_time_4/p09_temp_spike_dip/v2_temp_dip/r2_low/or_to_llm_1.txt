Reasoning for adjustment: carry-over shows sustained downward regime shifts earlier (most recent long-term averages fell), and holding cost equals profit so excess inventory is costly; pipeline already substantial (325) will cover many upcoming periods if demand stays at the lower regime. However recent single-period demand volatility (e.g., Periods 26\u201330 include several large demands) argues against under-ordering too aggressively. Action: place a modestly smaller-than-cap order of 120 units\u2014this reduces inventory risk vs ordering up to the cap, still increases coverage beyond OR's 107 to hedge demand volatility. This balances (1) confirmed lead time and large pipeline, (2) downward-shift carry-over evidence, and (3) recent demand spikes. Decision numeric tie: 325 (in-transit) + 120 (this order) = 445 pipeline vs OR base \u03bc\u0302=499 (shortfall 54 units) but avoids large holding cost exposure given equal holding/profit.",
