No evidence of lost shipments so far.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Use realized demands P1\u2013P5 = [114,117,103,106,132]. Mean single-period demand = 114.4.

OR's method includes extra safety stock from the fractile; given high profit vs low holding cost it biases upward (z*=1.645). However, a large shipment (345) is already en route and will arrive during this period, so ordering the full OR amount risks higher ending inventory and holding cost in future periods if demand does not increase.\n\nFinal decision: place a conservative order of 120 units (rounded to integer).
