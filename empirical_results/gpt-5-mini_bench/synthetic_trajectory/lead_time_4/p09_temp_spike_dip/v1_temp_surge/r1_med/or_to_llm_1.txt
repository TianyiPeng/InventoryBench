For promised L=4 the OR computes \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)\u03bc\u0304 = 572 units over the review+lead horizon.

This cap smooths volatility and is reasonable because we have no confirmed lead-time shortening or lost shipments.\n\nFinal strategy: Follow the OR recommendation of 144 units. Rationale: we lack conclusive evidence of lead-time or loss issues, pipeline is meaningfully short of the 5-period target so we should replenish toward the base-stock but respect OR's cap to avoid over-ordering given demand variability and holding cost.\n\nDecision specifics: Order 144 units now; monitor upcoming conclude messages for actual arrivals to update lead-time and detect lost shipments.
