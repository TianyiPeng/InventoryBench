We placed 572 units in Period 1 that show In-transit=572 and arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude \u2014 no arrival yet; this is consistent with promised LT=4 (arrival expected in Period_5), so treat the in-transit shipment as valid for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: current on-hand=0, in-transit=572.
