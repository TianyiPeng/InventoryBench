Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p09_temp_spike_dip\v1_temp_surge\r2_med\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 131), ('Period_2', 92), ('Period_3', 118), ('Period_4', 125), ('Period_5', 106)]
  Mean: 114.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical sample mean = (131+92+118+125+106)/5 = 114.4 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time changes or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand/statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost with standard baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Observed Period_1 conclude: ordered=141 arrived=0 \u2014 consistent with promised lead time (no concluded arrivals yet). On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (not overdue). No evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift (only one concluded demand sample visible). Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given no new signals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=296 (matches orders from P1=141 and P2=155) and no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time=4; since no concluded arrival messages exist for prior orders, there is no reliable evidence to change lead-time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean \u2248114.4 units/period and std \u224813.95. Pipeline (296) covers ~2.6 periods at current demand, but target coverage should be (1+L)=5 periods. To let the OR backend compute required order quantities using its base-stock formula while reflecting the promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the backend uses promised L and (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This avoids overreacting to missing conclude messages which may reflect normal lead-time delay or lost shipments that are not yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent concluded history shows no arrivals yet (Period_1-3 orders all arrived=0) while in-transit=453 and on-hand=0. No concluded arrivals imply we cannot confirm an actual lead time different from the promised 4; shipments may be delayed but not yet proven lost. Demand samples (historical seed) = [131,92,118,125,106], mean=114.4. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and the full-sample demand estimate, I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default mu/sigma (mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of all samples; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This provides a stable base-stock target covering the review+lead horizon while avoiding overreaction to unconfirmed delays; backend cap will limit order size if needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent raw demands = [131,92,118,125,106], mean=114.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=578 which roughly equals 5-period demand sum (572) so pipeline currently covers (1+L) demand. No concluded arrivals yet beyond what is expected under promised L=4 (orders placed in early periods would only conclude later), so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments. I therefore keep L at default (promised=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses all available samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service (pipeline \u2248 demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Profit: $420.00, Daily Holding Cost: $36.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: observed arrival in Period_5 conclude shows the order placed on Period_1 arrived with lead_time=4, matching the promised lead time. On-hand=36 + in-transit=450 provides substantial coverage; no evidence of lost shipments beyond the single confirmed arrival. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period_5 conclude: arrived=141 units ordered on Period_1, lead_time was 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $664.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from prior concludes. Recent on-hand=20 and in-transit=395 (many units arriving in future periods). Historical demand samples mean=114.4 (periods 1-5). I use default lead time (promised=4, confirmed by evidence) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps policy aligned with observed stable demand and confirmed lead time, avoiding aggressive trimming that could risk stockouts given long lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. On-hand=84, in-transit=404. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7), so set L by calculation of observed lead times. Recent demand shows a short-lived spike (Period_6=171) but overall variability persists; to balance responsiveness to recent changes and noise, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 5 demand observations) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods using recent mean and volatility rather than the long-run average. This favors service-level during the recent higher-demand episodes while keeping holding cost in check given large in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand history shows no sustained regime shift; historical sample mean = 114.4 units/period (samples provided). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in past concludes, so use observed lead-time average. On-hand=124, in-transit=442 (total pipeline 566) which roughly matches (1+L)*mean demand = 5*114.4=572, so no aggressive adjustment needed. Choose L by calculation (use observed lead times) and let mu_hat/sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for service-level sizing while respecting cap; this balances service (profit > holding cost) versus holding cost given stable demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=37, in-transit=467. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages show W=4). I choose L by 'calculate' to embed observed lead-time evidence. Demand stats (samples P1\u2013P5) are stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given significant pipeline inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=40, in-transit=462, historical demand samples available (Period_1-5). Concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10). Pipeline (462) plus on-hand (40) comfortably covers upcoming demand, but maintain forecasting that covers review+lead (L+1) periods. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time evidence. For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR backend compute base-stock and cap\u2014this balances service level (using confirmed lead time) against holding cost given available pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

No sustained demand regime change detected in the available samples (periods show stable demand around ~114 mean). Therefore use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service vs holding cost without overreacting to noise or single-period swings.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4. Historical sample mean demand = 114.4 units/period (samples Period_1\u20135). Current inventory: on-hand=195, in-transit=296 (total pipeline=491) which is below the (1+L)-period demand coverage of ~572, so we should target the full review+lead demand. Use observed lead time average for L and default demand/volatility aggregation to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using all samples; this is robust given stable demand samples and confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. On-hand=108, in-transit=346. Historical concludes (Periods 5\u201313) consistently show arrivals with 4-period lead time; no new lead-time or demand regime change detected. Pipeline + on-hand is healthy versus recent demand; to avoid overreacting to short-term noise I use default methods so the OR engine applies promised L=4 and the full-sample demand moments for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=96, in-transit=381 -> pipeline=477. Historical sample mean demand (Periods1-5)=114.4; with review+lead (1+L)=5 this implies demand over lead horizon \u2248572, so pipeline is short. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (confirmed=4) and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend sets mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This increases the target base stock to cover the 5-period demand horizon and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and steady demand samples (Period_1-5: 131,92,118,125,106; sample mean=114.4). On-hand=64, in-transit=396 covers multiple periods but arrivals are only visible with one-period delay. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead times (average observed = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given verified lead time while avoiding overfitting short-term fluctuations; it also keeps pipeline coverage conservative given in-transit inventory and potential delayed/ lost shipments.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has increased substantially: last 5 concluded demands (Periods13-17) average 142.6 vs earlier sample mean 114.4. To capture the recent uptick I set L by calculation of observed lead times and use recent_N for demand and volatility (N=5) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent variability. This raises target base-stock to better cover higher demand while the OR backend still applies its cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand P15-17 = 160.3 vs prior P1-14 = 103.6 (+54.6%), sustained for 3+ periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: confirmed sustained demand regime since Period 15 (higher demand: recent periods 15-18 avg \u2248165.8 vs prior \u2248103.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=588 which will arrive over upcoming periods but we still need to plan for elevated demand and 4-period realizations. Lead time historically observed = 4 in concluded messages. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 15-18). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated 5-period (1+L) demand while keeping safety stock informed by recent variance, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift from Period 15 onward (P15-19 avg = 172.4 vs prior much lower), and concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=699 (covers pipeline). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 15-19) to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to ensure the base-stock covers current elevated demand over review+lead. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility so safety stock aligns with current variability and avoids over/under-stocking given overdue/lost shipment risk is low (arrivals have been consistent).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent demand has shifted up since Period 15 (P15-20 mean = 175.83 units/period vs prior ~103.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=794 (~4.5 periods of recent demand), so pipeline roughly covers the next (L+1) periods but service risk remains if shipments are lost. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes, so I keep promised L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=6, periods 15\u201320) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the elevated recent mean/variance, improving service while limiting excess holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 start. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (concluded arrivals repeatedly show 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=780 (covers several future periods). Demand has shifted up starting Period 15 and has been sustained through Period 21 (P15-21 mean \u2248182.4, vs prior long-run ~103.6). To capture the new higher regime I set L to default (use promised/confirmed 4) and use recent_N for demand estimates focusing on the most recent 7 periods (P15-21) to reflect the sustained higher mean and elevated variance. This yields (1+L)-scaled mean ~5\xd7182.4 for mu_hat input to the OR engine while sigma_hat uses the std over the same 7-period window; these choices prioritize service (given high lost-sales cost) while avoiding excessive holding by limiting the horizon to the confirmed new regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_23: recent demand has been elevated since Period_15 (carry-over notes a sustained +54.6% shift). On-hand=39, in-transit=770 \u2014 with promised L=4 this provides substantial pipeline cover. Profit/holding implies high service target (q=0.8). No recent lost shipments; confirmed lead time=4 in history. Use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all observed samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock consistent with high service while respecting observed variability and the large existing pipeline.

On-hand = 9 and in-transit = 553, which with L=4 gives ample pipeline (covers (1+L) periods). Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent demand (Periods 15\u201323) and recent volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet higher service needs while avoiding excessive holding beyond the observed regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period_15 (avg P15-24 elevated). On-hand=64, in-transit=579 \u2014 pipeline is large and arriving shipments have been concluding with confirmed lead_time=4 (see history). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time (evidence: many concluded arrivals with W=4). For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=10 (periods 15\u201324) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 demands. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while keeping volatility estimation localized to the new regime; large in-transit reduces urgent ordering pressure.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_26. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_15 (sustained through P25). Confirmed lead time evidence (many concluded arrivals = 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=681. Recent-period (P15-25, 11 samples) average demand \u2248187.9 units/period \u2192 (1+L)=5 period demand \u2248940 units, so pipeline (681) is below required cover. I set L method to calculate (uses observed lead times = 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=11 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime so the OR backend will raise the base stock to meet the new demand while using recent volatility for safety.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 decision. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history (evidence: multiple 'arrived' messages with lead_time=4). Recent demand regime shifted up from ~104 to ~160 starting Period_15 and has persisted; I therefore focus forecasts on the post-shift regime. Current on-hand (82) + in-transit (733) = 815 units, which roughly covers 5=(1+L) periods of demand at the elevated regime (~160\xd75=800), so pipeline is adequate but not excessive. Choices: set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (Period_15\u2013Period_26) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap using the up-to-date mean/variance over the current regime and balances the 80% critical ratio (profit=4, holding=1) against holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=900. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals consistently show 4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period_15 and has persisted through recent periods. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) since conclude history confirms it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period_15 through Period_27, length=13) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent higher-demand regime; this raises target base-stock to improve service during sustained higher demand while sigma_hat from the same window captures elevated variability. This leverages the 900 units in-transit so backend orders only if pipeline+on-hand fall short of the adjusted base stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=164, in-transit=716. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (higher mean). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time data (confirmed L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=14 (covering the sustained high-demand regime from Period 15 through Period 28) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility based on the most relevant recent regime, improving service during elevated demand while avoiding excessive long-term safety stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30. On-hand=335, in-transit=534. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (confirmed earlier), no evidence of lost shipments. Demand exhibited a sustained higher regime starting Period_15; to capture that shift I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4), and I base demand forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime using recent_N with N=15 (covers Period_15\u2013Period_29) so mu_hat reflects the new mean and sigma_hat captures recent variability. This balances higher service needs from the shifted demand against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than longer historical averages.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=491, in-transit=337. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime shift (Periods 15-17+) is already recorded in carry-over. Given abundant pipeline and confirmed LT=4, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies full-sample mean/SD across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this keeps service high while backend's cap limits overordering.

Recent demand (Periods 27-31 = 125,83,71,88,53) shows a lower regime vs the earlier spike; to avoid excess future holding cost I set L=default (use promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the recent lower demand (reduces orders vs using the earlier high-demand regime). This balances service level (cover next 5 periods) against high holding cost given large on-hand stock and modest pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=566, in-transit=107. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4. Recent realized demand (Periods 28-32 = 83,71,88,53,102) is well below the elevated mid-game regime, so I bias the forecast to the very recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding costs. Set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing planned receipts and holding cost while preserving service for current lower demand.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34. Recent on-hand=538, in-transit=47 \u2014 deep inventory position after prior replenishments. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 29-33 = 71,88,53,102,88) shows a lower recent mean (~80) and moderate volatility; earlier demand regime shift (P15-17) is recorded but current realized demand has softened. To avoid further inflating inventory and incur holding cost, set L to default (promised/confirmed 4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. This biases orders downwards so pipeline + on-hand cover demand without unnecessary extra units, balancing high profit-driven service level against holding cost given current overstock.

Period 35: on-hand=489, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and recent demand spike (Period 15\u201317) is recorded in carry-over. No shipments currently overdue. Given high on-hand inventory I will use conservative/default forecasts so the OR engine will not push additional inventory: use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates. This avoids excess holding cost while relying on backend base-stock calculation to balance service level vs holding cost.

Demand regime shift detected at Period 15 (sustained higher demand); to capture the post-shift regime and recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over recent history. I choose N=20 to span the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. These parameters instruct the OR backend to size base-stock for the longer confirmed lead time and higher recent mean, balancing service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given current large on-hand and pipeline.

Period_38. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_15 (sustained); on-hand=142, in-transit=577 (pipeline large). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. To reflect confirmed lead time I set L="calculate" (backend will compute average observed lead times \u22484). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility emphasize the post-Period_15 regime while smoothing older low-demand history. This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand) against holding cost given a large current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 15 (carry-over). On-hand=12, in-transit=652 \u2014 ample pipeline but on-hand low. Use calculated L to confirm observed lead time (all concluded arrivals imply LT=4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-Period-15 higher regime and reduce influence of earlier low-demand periods. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine toward a higher base-stock matching the sustained demand increase while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; pipeline + order will cover (1+L) periods of demand given large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed historically). On-hand=151, in-transit=561 => pipeline 712 units. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 15; to reflect elevated recent demand I use recent_N over the latest 20 samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets higher base-stock and accounts for recent variability. L set to calculate to confirm observed lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=300, in-transit=356. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 15 (higher mean). I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-change higher-demand regime (regime length P15\u2013P40 \u2248 26 periods, capped at 20) so mu_hat reflects the recent elevated mean over the lead+review horizon. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward servicing the higher sustained demand while avoiding excessive holding by using recent regime stats and respecting pipeline (300 on-hand + 356 in-transit covers several periods).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=345, in-transit=285. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed). Recent demand (Periods 37-41 = 100,130,67,90,87) average=94.8 \u2014 demand near 95 in latest regime and current inventory is high. To keep ordering responsive to the most recent regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (recent_N N=5). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand estimate reflecting current demand levels and volatility; with profit/holding (q\u22480.8) the backend will lean toward service but my recent-based forecast avoids inflating orders from older high-demand bursts.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=266, in-transit=210. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (confirmed earlier), so I use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. No evidence of lost shipments or new demand regime shifts since prior insights. Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies its base-stock policy using the promised/observed lead time and full-sample statistics. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) with current ample pipeline inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand has been elevated historically (carry-over notes: demand regime shift at Period_15 persists). On-hand=265 + in-transit=294 => pipeline_total=559, which covers multiple periods of expected demand given L=4. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods (evidence in conclude messages). To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and the confirmed lead time, I select default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed across all samples with (1+L) scaling; L uses the promised/default lead time. This balances service (using all data and confirmed L) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in past concludes; recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. On-hand=215 + in-transit=401 = 616 units, which already covers many periods of demand (reduces urgency to ramp orders). To be conservative and let the OR engine apply its historical stats (and cap) given confirmed LT=4 and current high pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This avoids over-ordering while preserving service level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent demand (~last 5 periods 87,154,116,84,129) averages ~114 units. On-hand=147 + in-transit=420 = 567, which roughly covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean (5\xd7114=570). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default for L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-change regime and keep targets aligned with latest demand while avoiding overreaction to single-period noise. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base-stock to recent demand and observed pipeline so orders are not excessive given holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=76, in-transit=479 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods. To respect observed LT and let OR engine use full sample stats for demand, set L by 'calculate' (average observed LT=4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps service-level targets from the OR formula while avoiding extra stock given already-large pipeline, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Pipeline + on-hand (~617) covers multiple periods of elevated demand but no new sustained changepoint detected since prior insights. To remain conservative and let the OR engine use the full observed demand history and promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes L=promised (4) and demand forecast/volatility from all samples. This balances service (higher q from profit/holding) with holding cost while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence rather than short-term noise.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent demand (Periods 44-48 = 84,129,71,74,106) averages ~92.8 \u2014 well below the earlier high-regime (~160) that occurred around P15-17 and not sustained now. On-hand=236, in-transit=344 (total pipeline=580) which is ample vs short-term demand; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 4) to keep OR engine aligned with contract. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the immediate recent regime and reduce influence of the older high-demand spike; N=5 captures the last 5 periods where demand returned to lower levels. This balances service (using recent demand to avoid overstock) against holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50. History of concluded arrivals shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded messages P5..P49 with lead_time 4). Current inventory: on-hand=195, in-transit=264 (pipeline adequate short-term). To respect confirmed lead time and recent demand patterns I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand has changed over time (earlier regime shift at P15 recorded previously) so I bias forecasts to recent data: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand mean and volatility over the most recent 20 periods. These choices ensure the OR engine sizes the (1+L)-period demand forecast using recent demand while using confirmed lead time to avoid underordering due to delayed arrivals.
