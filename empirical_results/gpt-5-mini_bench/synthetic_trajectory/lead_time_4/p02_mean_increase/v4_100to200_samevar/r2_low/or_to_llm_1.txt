OR computed cap-limited order=143 (matches cap = 91 + 1.645*31.21 \u2248 143) using q=0.5 (profit=holding \u2192 z*=0) and the capping rule. Reality checks: no concluded arrivals exist to suggest actual lead time differs from promised or any lost shipments, so we must treat promised L=4 as plausible. Given zero pipeline, any order placed now will not arrive until Period 5 (cannot satisfy demand in Periods 1\u20134). Ordering the full forecasted 455 would only arrive together later and likely create large ending inventory (holding cost = $1/unit equals profit) and risk negative marginal return on leftover stock. With profit and holding cost equal, over-ordering beyond expected realized demand when arrivals finally occur gives little upside. Therefore follow the OR capped recommendation of 143 units as a balanced, risk-averse replenishment that respects the OR cap and avoids excessive ending inventory while providing some stock when it arrives.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed = 4 periods from concluded history. Inventory: on-hand=218, in-transit=548 \u2192 pipeline_total=766. Demand outlook: carry-over insight shows a sustained regime shift to ~220 units per period since Period 16, so (1+L) demand over lead+review \u2248 1100 units. However, any order placed in Period 48 would arrive in Period 52 (P48+4) and thus after the game horizon (Period 50), so it cannot contribute to sales in remaining periods. Placing an order therefore only increases holding cost after horizon and cannot prevent stockouts before arrival. Given existing pipeline (766) and remaining periods (49\u201350) vs. current on-hand (218) which will be used to satisfy immediate demand, I place no order. This follows the OR baseline logic (which suggested a small order) but overrides it because of lead-time timing and horizon constraints.",
