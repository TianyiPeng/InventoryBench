Decision: order 312 units now to bring total pipeline toward meeting expected demand over the next 5 periods. This overrides OR's capped recommendation because the OR cap (\u2248142) is too conservative given long lead time and large (L+1)-period demand; stockouts are more damaging to profit than moderate holding costs here.
