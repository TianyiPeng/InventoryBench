Orders placed now will only arrive after these 5 periods of demand, so on-hand + in-transit must cover that horizon.

OR recommended 149 (cap-limited): OR computed a capped base-stock recommendation (cap \u2248149) to limit order volatility, but that would leave us severely understocked for the 5-period horizon (149 << 509), risking heavy lost sales. Cost tradeoff: Profit per unit $19 >> holding $1, so the policy should favor availability over holding. Decision: place enough to cover expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon, i.e., 509 units. This overrides OR's capped recommendation because OR's cap smooths swings but here starting inventory/pipeline are zero and demand mean implies we need 509 to meet expected demand until arrivals; holding cost is low relative to profit, so stocking to expected demand is justified. Error/loss risk: If actual demand is much lower, we incur modest holding cost ($1/unit/period). If shipments are lost or lead time is longer than promised, we'll need to reassess in future periods using concluded arrival messages. ",
