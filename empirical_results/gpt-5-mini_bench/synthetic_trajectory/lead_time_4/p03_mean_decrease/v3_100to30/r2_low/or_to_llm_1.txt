Demand outlook: historical mean (early periods) = 92.2 but carry-over shows sustained lower regime with recent 5-period averages near 30\u201340 (Periods 36\u201340 avg \u224839.4; recent rolling periods show ~32.4). Profit and holding cost equal \u2192 critical fractile q=0.5 (no safety stock implied by newsvendor). OR recommends 97 using promised L and long-run history; that would materially overstock given current lower demand and large pipeline. Compute coverage: current pipeline+on-hand =187 units; at 5-period demand of 40/day \u2192 need \u2248200 (short \u224813); at 32/day \u2192 need \u2248160 (excess 27). To avoid costly excess holding (holding cost = profit) I place a small top-up to cover the higher-end shortfall while remaining conservative: order 15 units now.
