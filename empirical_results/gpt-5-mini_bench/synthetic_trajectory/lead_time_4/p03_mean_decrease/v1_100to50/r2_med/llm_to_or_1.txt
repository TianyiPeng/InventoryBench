Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p03_mean_decrease\v1_100to50\r2_med\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 118), ('Period_2', 124), ('Period_3', 116), ('Period_4', 96), ('Period_5', 91)]
  Mean: 109.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no 'conclude' messages so no observed lead-time; historical samples available: [118,124,116,96,91], mean=109. Promised lead time used (default L=4). Use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 5*109 = 545 (backend will compute). Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std_all) since no recent changepoint or evidence of regime shift. This keeps the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and historical demand while avoiding premature adjustments given no concluded arrivals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=133, no concluded arrivals yet (Period_1 conclude: ordered=133 arrived=0) so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~109 units/period; no sustained changepoint detected. Use default methods so backend sets (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std with L = promised lead time to cover the review+lead demand horizon and let OR cap limit orders given current pipeline inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=266 (two orders of 133 placed in P1 and P2) but no arrivals have concluded yet \u2014 shipments overdue relative to promised lead time but insufficient concluded evidence to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised L=4) because only concluded arrivals can confirm lead-time changes. Demand history (all samples) will be used for forecasting: set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all provided samples, balancing service level and holding cost given no confirmed regime shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Demand history (five-sample) mean=109.0, std\u224813.03. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 and no concluded arrivals for prior orders (Periods 1-3 arrived=0) \u2014 shipments are overdue but actual lead time not yet confirmed (no conclude showing arrivals). Use default promised lead time to let OR backend assume L=4, and default demand/volatility computations to reflect the full (1+L) review+lead horizon and avoid overreacting to potentially lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Recent realized demand samples (canonical): [118,124,116,96,91], mean=109. On-hand=0, in-transit=526 but no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 each show arrived=0). Promised lead time is 4; because no concluded arrivals exist to compute an empirical lead time, I use the default promised lead time to avoid prematurely trusting incomplete arrival data. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std: this captures all available demand history and keeps buffering for the 5-period coverage (current + L). This approach balances service (higher base-stock from full-sample mean across 5 periods) against holding cost while acknowledging many in-transit units that may be delayed or lost; future periods will reassess if arrivals conclude or more evidence of lost shipments accumulates.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (ordered: 133, 133, 131, 129) \u2014 all concluded with arrived=0; suggests prolonged delays or possible lost shipments, warrants monitoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $477.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=11, in-transit=475. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean=109; recent arrivals show orders from Periods 2\u20135 still outstanding but Period_1 order concluded in Period_5 (lead_time observed=4). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from concluded arrivals (backend will average observed lead times; current evidence yields 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to full-sample demand while the confirmed lead time raises required pipeline cover. This balances the high service-level implied by profit/holding (q=0.8) against holding cost and accounts for delayed shipments by increasing pipeline coverage through the (1+L) multiplier.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5)

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision: recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders on P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): [118,124,116,96,91], mean=109. On-hand=71, in-transit=466 (pipeline large). Given confirmed LT=4 and stable recent demand, use calculated lead time from observations and default demand estimates across the full sample to let OR backend compute base stock and cap. This balances service (use full-sample mean \xd7 (1+L)) against holding cost; large pipeline reduces immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Daily Reward (R_t): $498.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 context: observed confirmed lead times of 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=62, in-transit=394 \u2014 pipeline is substantial. Recent missing-arrival history earlier flagged delays, but three concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Use L=calculate to lock in observed lead time. Demand historical samples available; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples and aligns orders with the 5-period coverage requirement. This balances service (given high pipeline) against holding costs and accounts for earlier delays by relying on confirmed lead-time evidence rather than assuming losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent conclude messages confirm observed lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived with W=4). Current on-hand=86 + in-transit=418 provides ample pipeline but several past orders initially showed arrived=0 then later concluded at LT=4, indicating delays resolved to LT=4. No sustained demand regime shift detected (historical samples remain the primary forecast). To be conservative and align with confirmed actual lead time, set L via calculate so backend uses observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=26, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1\u2013P5 each had lead_time=4). Demand samples available (Period_1\u20135) show no sustained regime shift. I set L via "calculate" to let backend use observed lead times (confirming 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for the 4-period pipeline while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise; this keeps service high given large in-transit volume while controlling holding cost.

On-hand=4, in-transit=466 \u2014 ample pipeline but on-hand very low heading into demand. No sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demands vary but show no new, persistent change. Use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend uses all historical samples to set base stock; this balances service level (profit>holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to short-term variability or past missing arrivals which have resolved.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: orders placed P1\u2013P9 arrived after 4 periods). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean ~109; current on-hand=80, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). To let OR backend use full data and promised lead-time signals, set L by calculate (use observed lead times), use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This leverages confirmed LT=4, keeps forecast broad given limited sample size, and lets the capped policy control order sizes against the large in-transit volume to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=162, in-transit=368. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders concluded show W=4), so set L to calculated average lead time. Demand samples show no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders sized by observed lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise; with on-hand + pipeline high, the capped ordering will limit new receipts and control holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=210, in-transit=274. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P11 arrived after 4 periods). Demand history shows moderate variability but no recent sustained regime shift. I choose L by 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4 so OR backend plans across correct pipeline horizon. For demand sizing I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples\u2014this is conservative given stable demand and avoids overfitting to short-term fluctuations. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + in-transit stock; it also prevents unnecessary extra safety stock given no new sustained demand spike or lead-time change.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean demand 109 units/period; no sustained regime shift detected. On-hand=180, in-transit=331 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=511 units, which covers multiple periods given recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (stable). I therefore use default lead time and default demand/variability calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; this keeps service high given large pipeline while avoiding manual down-adjustments that could understock if delays reoccur.

LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=187, in-transit=332. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. No sustained demand regime change detected (recent demand fluctuates around historical mean). Use lead time estimate from observed conclusions and let OR backend compute demand coverage using full-sample stats. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost by relying on default mu/sigma (backend will size base-stock and cap using all samples).

Recent demand samples (periods provided earlier) have mean ~109 units/period. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained demand shift, use calculated lead time to reflect observed data and default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine derives base-stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This conservative choice avoids overreacting to transient fluctuations and helps ensure pipeline+on-hand cover (L+1) periods while controlling holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

No sustained demand regime change detected. I use default lead time (promised) which equals observed 4, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this keeps forecasting conservative given confirmed L=4 and avoids overreacting to short-term noise. On-hand + in-transit provides coverage for several periods; using defaults balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) without adding unnecessary inventory given holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=343, in-transit=153. Historical concluded lead times all equal 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P19 that concluded show lead_time=4). Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) indicate mean demand = (118+124+116+96+91)/5 = 109.0; with confirmed L=4, I use the backend's default demand aggregation to cover review+lead. Setting L to 'calculate' (uses observed lead times) ensures we respect confirmed 4-period lead time. Using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat directs the OR engine to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (via base-stock formula) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and available in-transit. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while acknowledging confirmed LT=4 and existing pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=350, in-transit=148. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5 etc.). Early-period missing arrivals were resolved and recent history shows stable arrivals at lead time 4. Profit=4, holding=1 implies a high service target; use baseline demand estimates from full-sample statistics with promised lead time to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap. Methods chosen: L=default to keep lead time at promised/observed 4; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = conservative aggregate forecast; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) so the backend sets safety stock reflecting historical volatility. This balances service level (high profit) against holding cost while relying on confirmed lead-time behavior and full-sample demand stats.

Period 27: on-hand=337, in-transit=129 (pipeline=466). Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean=109. Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I set L using observed data (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given current pipeline short of the (1+L)-period demand forecast and addresses earlier missing-arrival concerns by relying on confirmed observed lead time rather than promised values.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and no ongoing lost-shipment signal; on-hand=327, in-transit=128 provides ample coverage. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed 4-period arrivals. Demand history (samples mean=109 over provided samples) is stable so use default aggregation for mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility for sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These defaults produce a base-stock anchored to historical mean while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise; they also respect pipeline inventory and limit holding cost buildup.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (many arrivals labelled lead_time=4). On-hand=331, in-transit=142. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): [118,124,116,96,91] with stable lower recent demand. Because lead time is confirmed and demand shows no sustained regime shift, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised L. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the OR cap limits order size to control holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=300, in-transit=141. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed with W=4). There were earlier missing arrivals but subsequent concludes confirm stable L=4. I set L method='calculate' to lock actual observed lead time. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) which preserves the long-run sample mean (mean of provided samples=109 \u2192 5\xd7109=545) and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect scaled demand volatility. These choices keep the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time, use full-sample demand estimates to avoid overreacting to short-term noise, and balance service level vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Recent demand samples (provided) have mean 109 units/period. To match confirmed lead time I ask backend to infer L from observed lead times (calculate). For demand and volatility I use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (profit $4 vs hold $1) without overreacting to short-term noise given ample on-hand inventory. No explicit adjustment for missing shipments is made here because lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; monitor future concludes for losses.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=279, in-transit=157. Historical sample mean=109 (samples:118,124,116,96,91). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4; choose L by calculate to reflect observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend targets (1+L)*mean = 5\xd7109 = 545 units across review+lead. Current pipeline (279+157=436) is below that target, so OR will place orders to replenish. This approach reconciles prior missing arrivals (now explained by confirmed 4-period lead time) and balances service level vs holding cost using the profit/holding tradeoff in the OR engine.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_34 context: on-hand=272, in-transit=174. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2013P29 arrived with W=4), and earlier missing arrivals were resolved (so use confirmed LT=4). Demand history (samples provided) shows moderate, stable demand. I choose L via 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level versus holding cost given current inventory (healthy on-hand + in-transit) and avoids overfitting to short-term noise or transient missing-shipment events.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=298, in-transit=148. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P30 that concluded report W=4). No evidence of lost shipments in recent concluded history. To align OR backend with observed lead time I request L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full sample history and the inferred lead time to produce stable base-stock and cap values while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

On-hand=258, in-transit=152 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy with no newly missing shipments.

No sustained changepoint in demand; use lead-time estimate from observations and default demand volatility/mean across all samples so OR backend computes base_stock and cap consistently.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=148, in-transit=241. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Recent history shows stable demand without a sustained (3+ period) shift. There are no newly detected lost shipments beyond earlier noted events. Therefore use default (promised) lead time so the OR engine applies observed statistics; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances the profit($4)/holding($1) tradeoff via its service-level based base stock while avoiding manual overcorrection for transient variability.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=170, in-transit=244. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 (confirmed); earlier missing arrivals noted but recent history shows regular 4-period arrivals. I choose L='calculate' to lock to observed average lead time (4). Demand seed uses the provided samples' mean: use mu_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures 5-period coverage). Volatility left to backend with sigma_hat='default' (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine sets base-stock and cap using observed variability. This balances service level (covering current+L future demand) versus holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand samples available are the provided five-sample series (mean=109). Current on-hand=171, in-transit=216 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample against expected demand but pipeline delays were observed historically; to remain consistent with confirmed lead time and stable demand I use defaults so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using all samples. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) versus holding cost by relying on backend's base-stock calcs.

Period 44. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals match orders with 4-period lag). On-hand=206, in-transit=190 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs typical demand. Use calculated lead time consistent with observations and default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full-sample statistics; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise or the earlier missing-arrival episodes which are already resolved in the history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=204, in-transit=194. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders observed arriving 4 periods after order), so use the promised/default lead time. Demand history (samples 118,124,116,96,91; mean=109) shows no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend produces base-stock sized for 5-period coverage while balancing profit vs. holding cost. This also avoids overreacting to short-term noise given healthy on-hand + pipeline (total 398 units).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=208, in-transit=172. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders: ordered on Pn arrived on Pn+4). Early missing-arrival episodes were resolved and arrivals since Period_5 confirm L=4. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135: 118,124,116,96,91) are the available seed data; I choose to let the OR engine compute demand across the review+lead period using its default rules so it uses all samples scaled by (1+L). Using default sigma lets the backend compute volatility over all samples as well. These choices align with confirmed lead time and avoid overreacting to short-term noise while ensuring pipeline + on-hand will be evaluated against a (1+L)-period forecast.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=225, in-transit=195. Historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4 periods (observed arrivals = orders placed 4 periods earlier), so I use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. Demand history shows no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand sizing and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) so the OR engine uses full-sample estimates. This balances service (acknowledged L=4) against holding cost given healthy on-hand + pipeline. No new evidence of lost shipments in recent concluded history.

Use default lead time (promised) confirmed by history, and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (conservative given limited recent evidence). This balances service level (uses full lead+review demand) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to isolated arrival anomalies.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: on-hand=180, in-transit=178; promised L=4 and concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Current pipeline + on-hand (~358 units) covers several periods of typical demand. I choose to let the OR engine infer L from observed lead times (calculate) to confirm the 4-period reality, and to use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample demand estimate with confirmed L) against holding cost given current healthy inventory. No aggressive up/down adjustments because demand history is stable and shipments appear reliable with lead_time=4.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 provided historically) show moderate, stable demand; observed lead times have repeatedly concluded at 4 periods. Current on-hand=175, in-transit=210 \u2014 pipeline+on-hand provides a multi-period cushion vs typical demand. No sustained demand regime change detected. Therefore use the promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level (use full history) with holding cost given current healthy inventory position.
