No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is not confirmed. Demand history mean = 109 units/period (samples: 118,124,116,96,91), sample SD \u224814.56.

Analysis & decision drivers: We currently have on-hand 0 and in-transit 133, which covers only \u22481.2 periods of expected demand (133/109), far below the required (L+1)=5 periods' coverage (\u2248545 units). The OR cap prevents a large corrective order; given we already stocked out this period (sold=0 when demand=83) and lead time is long (promised 4) we should replenish pipeline toward the base-stock target rather than accept repeated stockouts. Risk: orders may be lost or actual lead time may differ \u2014 we have no concluded evidence of loss yet. Action chosen: place order = base_stock \u2212 pipeline \u2248 572 \u2212 133 = 439 units to rebuild the pipeline toward the target service level (rounded to integer). This overrides OR's capped 133 because the cap would leave us chronically understocked given the long replenishment delay. We accept higher holding cost to avoid lost sales and capture profit margin ($4) per unit.
