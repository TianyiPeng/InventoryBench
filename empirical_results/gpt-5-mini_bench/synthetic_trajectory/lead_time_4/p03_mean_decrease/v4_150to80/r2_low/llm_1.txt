Given the lead time uncertainty and execution sequence (orders placed now must cover current period demand plus L future periods because arrivals occur after decision), we need enough coverage for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. e) Final order logic: Use the 5-period average demand as forecast (145.4 \u2248 145 units/period). Required coverage = 145.4 \xd7 5 \u2248 727 units. Current on-hand + in-transit = 0, so order = 727 units.
