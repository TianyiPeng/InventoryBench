OR recommended 137 (cap-limited); OR uses full-horizon base-stock and promised lead time but is capped. Because lost sales cost (profit $19) is much higher than holding cost $1, and this order (if placed now) will still arrive within the remaining selling horizon (Period 50), we should fill the expected shortfall rather than accept stockouts. Final strategy: place an order to cover the estimated shortfall of ~151 units (slightly above OR's 137 cap). This balances high stockout cost vs low holding cost and ensures coverage for the remaining 5 periods given confirmed lead time.",

Inventory & demand analysis: current on-hand = 97 and in-transit = 247. In-transit consists of orders placed in Periods 44\u201347 (40 + 56 + 151 + 0 = 247) and the first three of those (40, 56, 151) will arrive during Periods 48\u201350, so total available stock over the remaining 3 periods = 97 + 247 = 344 units.
