Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats: historical samples (122,121,60,83,105) give mean=98.2; with L=4 the review+lead multiplier is (1+L)=5. Default methods keep OR backend's baseline forecasts and avoid overfitting given no evidence of regime change or delayed shipments. This balances service (covering ~5 periods of average demand) against holding cost while we wait for arrival/conclude signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=142 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; promised lead time remains best prior. Demand samples (Periods 1-5) available but no sustained regime shift detected. To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default methods: L=promised, mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples), sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This handles the outstanding in-transit shipment conservatively while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full-sample estimates.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=286. Historical sample demands for chips(Regular) show mean ~98.2 per period (samples: 122,121,60,83,105). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet beyond normal expectations, so no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipment. Pipeline (286) is below the (L+1)-period demand (default policy uses 5\xd7mean\u2248491), so we keep L at promised value and use default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Methods chosen are conservative and rely on full-sample statistics given the limited concluded history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Historical demand samples (all available): [122,121,60,83,105] -> mean=98.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=426 (orders placed P1-P3 still in pipeline). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals have been observed yet; this is expected because orders placed in early periods would not conclude until later (no evidence of lost shipments or shorter/longer actual lead time). I therefore keep L as default (promised). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat will let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples (captures current overall demand expectation and variance). This balances service level (using full-sample mean over the full review+lead period) against holding cost while avoiding premature adjustments based on unconcluded pipeline.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Recent demands: [122,121,60,83,105], mean=98.2. Promised lead time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=562 which exceeds (1+L)*mean forecast (5*98.2=491), so pipeline likely sufficient to cover next 5 periods; no concluded arrivals yet so no confirmed lead-time change. Use default lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock; this balances high profit vs low holding cost while avoiding extra orders given large in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2658.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6. Recent demand (Periods 1-5): [121,87,96,86,140], mean=106. On-hand=2, in-transit=426 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=428 units. Period_5 conclude shows arrival of Period_1 order with lead_time=4, so actual lead time aligns with promised. I choose L by "calculate" to lock in observed lead time average. For demand forecast I use "default" (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd7106) to reflect overall recent average across periods; sigma_hat use "default" so backend scales sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (large pipeline present) against holding cost: with confirmed L=4 the default (1+L)-scaled mean/vol will produce base-stock sufficient to cover 5 periods of demand while capping orders via OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 conclude \u2192 lead_time = 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1514.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (from concluded arrivals). Recent demand samples mean = 98.2 units/period (samples: 122,121,60,83,105). On-hand=63 + in-transit=424 = 487 units total pipeline. With promised/observed L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods => nominal (1+L)*mean \u2248 491 units; pipeline is slightly below the default coverage (487 vs ~491). To align the OR backend with observed reality and preserve service level while controlling holding cost, set L by calculation (use observed lead times) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance over the 5-period horizon. This handles the confirmed 4-period lead time and lets the capped ordering rule limit order size if needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1337.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 start: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals P5,P6,P7). Current on-hand=126, in-transit=386; pipeline + on-hand covers several periods but recent demand (P5=140, P6=83, P7=77) shows a higher recent mean than earlier series. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (mean ~100) and scale by (1+L) in backend; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (maintain stock through confirmed 4-period lead time) while keeping safety stock responsive to the recent drop from the P5 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2258.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: recent realized demand has been variable but overall moderate (recent demands: P5=140, P6=83, P7=77, P8=126). On-hand=136, in-transit=366 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 502 units, so current coverage is ample versus short-term demand. Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period_6 insight). To keep alignment with confirmed lead time and historical demand samples, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from all available samples and its cap; this avoids overfitting to short recent swings while honoring the high service-level implied by profit vs holding cost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20139) average = 101.4 units/period (samples: 121,87,96,86,140,83,77,126,97). On-hand=45, in-transit=448 \u2192 pipeline total=493. Lead time confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude; no evidence of lost shipments. Using default L (promised/confirmed =4) so mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (\u22485\xd7101.4\u2248507) and sigma_hat uses default volatility scaling. This keeps the OR engine grounded in the long-run demand estimate while the pipeline (493) is slightly below the 5-period demand forecast (~507), nudging replenishment to cover the (L+1)-period demand while controlling holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 11: on-hand=85, in-transit=399 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times all equal 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated lead time. Given ample pipeline and moderate recent demand, use default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend yields conservative order quantities (avoids excess holding). Methods chosen: L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from history.

LLM Rationale:
Period_12 decision. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). On-hand=73, in-transit=396 \u2192 large pipeline covering multiple future periods; use recent demand to capture current regime. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demands P7\u2013P11) to reflect the current mean/volatility (recent mean \u2248103.2 demand/period \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248 516 demand across review+lead). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while avoiding over-reacting to older data; sigma recent_N matches mu_hat to size safety stock appropriately given observed variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=76, in-transit=394 (total pipeline+on-hand=470). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from history. Using default methods lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples and promised L=4 so orders will target coverage of the review+lead horizon; this is appropriate given the confirmed L and no new demand regime evidence. Defaults avoid overfitting to short-term noise and let the capped ordering cap control order size.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: demand recently stable with historical samples (Periods 1\u20135) and observed demands in concludes; on-hand=74, in-transit=413 (ample pipeline). Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4. I use default lead time to match confirmed 4-period behavior. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this leverages all observed demand history and the confirmed lead time. With high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) the OR engine will target high fill rate; using defaults avoids overreacting to short-term noise given large pipeline and avoids unnecessary holding-cost-driven reductions.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Recent demand ~90-140 (historical samples). On-hand=109, in-transit=405 -> total pipeline=514, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods of demand (~500 units) so no aggressive replenishment needed. Lead time was confirmed as 4 in Period 6; therefore use default lead-time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std and promised L=4. This balances service (sufficient pipeline to meet demand over L+1 periods) against holding cost by avoiding extra ordering while cap constraint limits order size.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=132, in-transit=349. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 (carry-over). Given stable arrivals and no sustained demand regime shift, use promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)-horizon demand and safety stock. This balances very high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by allowing the backend to target a high service level while capping orders via its cap rule.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=182, in-transit=351. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (Periods 5\u201317 arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Recent demand has moderated \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [111,95,64,92,37], average \u224879.8. To keep safety responsive to this recent lower-demand regime, set L via calculate (confirmed 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent mean/volatility over the review+lead window and reduce overstock risk given high pipeline. This approach preserves service for the 4-period lead while tightening target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost and to account for no missing shipments recently.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=202, in-transit=239. Historical demand samples (5) show stable average (~98.2) with no sustained changepoint in the last periods and lead time confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages. Pipeline + on-hand already comfortably covers several (L+1=5) periods of demand, so use the backend defaults (promised L and default demand stats) to let the OR engine compute base_stock while avoiding overfitting to short-term fluctuations. This balances service level (using full historical mean over the review+lead window) against holding cost given already-elevated inventory.

Demand samples (provided) have mean ~98.2; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) balances service level vs holding given profit=19 and holding=1.

Given high profit relative to holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 target service level high) and no new sustained demand regime detected, use default/statistics-based settings to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full sample history.

On-hand=359, in-transit=167 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand well above typical (1+L)\xd7mean demand; no evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments. Use observed lead time (calculate) to ensure OR backend uses actual LT information; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 20-24 = 40,37,45,13,44) is markedly lower than early-sample mean, so I use a recent_N demand estimate to avoid over-ordering given high on-hand. L kept at promised/default=4 since multiple concludes confirm L=4. mu_hat: recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean_recent). sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for safety stock while not inflating orders.

I use "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (uses full-sample mean to stabilize forecast). This balances service level (use full-history mean over the 5-sample seed) against holding cost; current on-hand+pipeline (425) is slightly below the 5-period target the backend will compute, so the resulting order will replenish toward the base-stock while respecting the backend cap.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Demand recent history shows lower/volatile weekly sales with a single spike (Period_25=189). On-hand=249 and in-transit=302 (large pipeline); past concluded messages confirm actual lead time=4. To avoid over-ordering given large inventory and recent lower demand, I use the promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime while keeping variability measured over the same window. This reduces target base_stock vs older higher-demand periods and tempers order quantities while the large pipeline runs down.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Historical demand samples show mean demand ~ (122,121,60,83,105,...,199) with recent high variability (large spikes at Periods 25 and 28). On-hand=59, in-transit=313; recent conclude messages consistently show actual lead time =4. Given confirmed lead time and no new sustained demand regime shift (need 3+ periods of a new pattern), use default methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This leverages the confirmed L=4, preserves service (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high target fill) while letting backend cap orders by its cap rule to limit overstock from in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: recent demand volatile with occasional large spikes and a stockout last period (ending inventory=0). Actual lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand=0 and in-transit=473; using historical sample mean (122,121,60,83,105) the (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd798.2 = 491, so pipeline is slightly short (~18 units). I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full-sample statistics and the capped ordering logic to top up the small shortfall while avoiding excess holding cost given high profit/holding ratio.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=138, in-transit=451 (pipeline total=589). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods. Use default lead time (promised=4). Demand historical samples (seed) are limited and no sustained recent regime change is evident, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to long-run stats, balancing high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by leveraging the backend's service-level calculation rather than inflating safety stock given ample pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical sample mean (periods shown) \u224898.2 units; lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in earlier concludes. Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), so prioritize service level. Use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history with promised lead time (aligned with confirmed observations); this keeps orders conservative given high pipeline but preserves high fill rate.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 start. Recent demand is variable with a large spike at Period_28 (199) but the last five concluded demands (P28\u2013P32 = 199,136,13,122,55) average ~105; on-hand=123, in-transit=422 (no new overdue arrivals signalled). Observed lead times in concluded history have been consistently 4 periods. To balance service vs holding cost I set L via calculate (uses observed lead times=4), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the most recent regime including the recent spike while keeping volatility measured from the same window.

Recent demand history shows variable but no sustained regime change requiring a different forecast. Given high on-hand + in-transit relative to typical period demand and confirmed LT=4, use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=561 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand has been volatile but no sustained regime shift detected. Use calculated lead time to confirm observed 4-period lead; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders aligned with long-run demand estimates while the large in-transit stock provides service coverage; avoids overreacting to recent noise or occasional missing arrivals.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=96, in-transit=530; historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in carry-over). Demand samples available (122,121,60,83,105). Pipeline (626 units) is ample vs. one-period demand, so use confirmed lead time. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) with holding cost given large pipeline and confirmed stable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed repeatedly in concluded messages, e.g., Period 1\u2192P5, Period 2\u2192P6, etc.)

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and current on-hand=190, in-transit=419. Profit/holding ($19/$1) implies high service level. I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all sample history to compute base-stock; this leverages the long historical demand series and the confirmed LT=4 while avoiding overfitting to recent variability. The current pipeline + on-hand (609 units) already covers multiple periods of demand, so default \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 will temper additional ordering and balance service vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3481.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Recent demand has been volatile but long-run sample mean from historical seed data is ~98.2 units/period; promised lead time is 4 and concluded messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=167 + in-transit=263 => pipeline_inventory=430 (sufficient coverage vs. short-term demand). I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time (matches confirmed observations). I choose mu_hat=default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean from the seed samples (conservative, stable central estimate across available data). I choose sigma_hat=default so the backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of seed samples to reflect observed demand variability. These settings balance service (using confirmed L and seed mean) while avoiding aggressive increase in forecast that would raise holding costs given already-large pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-322.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~98.2 units. Current inventory: on-hand=341, in-transit=266. No new sustained changepoint detected. To be conservative and leverage the OR engine's statistics (and because lead time has been consistently 4), I use default methods so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while the pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) already covers multiple review+lead periods, avoiding excessive additional ordering and minimizing holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: demand context based on historical samples (Period_1-5: 122,121,60,83,105). On-hand=265, in-transit=219. Concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 4. I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while respecting confirmed L=4 and avoids overreacting to recent noise; current on-hand + pipeline is ample vs. typical (5-period) demand but defaults balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2913.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 decision. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=108, in-transit=373 (healthy pipeline). Given stable lead-time evidence and no sustained recent demand regime shift (historical samples show variable demand but no 3+ period persistent change), use default estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. Profit $19 vs holding $1 yields a very high service quantile (q\u22480.95) so allowing backend to size base-stock from full-history keeps service while letting cap limit extreme orders. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments required now.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_48. On-hand=0, in-transit=528. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline (528) will cover multiple periods of demand but current on-hand is zero so maintain standard safety. Use default lead time (promised 4) because concluded history confirms it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given stable demand samples and confirmed lead time. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or lost shipments beyond already recorded patterns.

Current on-hand=119 and in-transit=479 (healthy pipeline). No evidence of lost shipments or a sustained demand regime change. Use promised/default lead time to align with supplier promise and confirmed observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level versus holding cost given stable historical patterns and high pipeline inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=1, in-transit=508. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time=4 (many Period Z\u2192Z+4 arrivals). Demand samples provided (Periods 1-5) have mean=98.2; using default (1+L)\xd7mean gives expected demand over review+lead horizon of ~491. Pipeline (508) comfortably covers forecasted demand plus safety implied by OR engine. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies its base-stock + cap logic without overreacting to transient arrival variability; this balances service level (large profit) against holding cost while respecting observed 4-period lead time.
