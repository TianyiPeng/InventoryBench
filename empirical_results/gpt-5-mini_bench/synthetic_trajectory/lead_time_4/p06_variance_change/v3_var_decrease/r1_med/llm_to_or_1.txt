Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals. Historical samples mean=54.8 units/period (samples: 58,163,41,0,12). Promised lead time=4 periods and no evidence to contradict it yet. Use default lead time to rely on promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited data and zero pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2: on-hand=0, in-transit=162 (order placed P1 not yet concluded\u2014expected with promised lead time). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) to let OR backend assume standard L=4. Demand history available (Periods 1-5 samples) will be used by backend default formulas: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost given current in-transit coverage and no evidence of lost shipment or demand regime shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=313. Promised lead time=4 and past orders (P1,P2) have not concluded yet \u2014 no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Historical sample mean demand = 54.8 units/period (samples: 58,163,41,0,12). Using default lead time and default demand stats keeps the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and historical variability. Pipeline (313) already covers the (1+L) demand forecast (default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5*54.8 = 274), so no aggressive up-weighting of demand or volatility is needed given lack of confirmed regime change or lost-shipment evidence.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: recent observed on-hand=0 with in-transit=418. Historical demand samples (provided) mean=54.8 units/period (samples: 58,163,41,0,12). Promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed still within promised window), so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments. I choose default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance over the review+lead window ((1+L)\xd7mean) to set base-stock; this balances service (using all data) against holding cost given no confirmed regime shift. No explicit change to sigma is made because volatility signals are not yet sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=418. Historical demand samples average=54.8 units/period (samples: 58,163,41,0,12). Orders placed in early periods have not concluded (arrivals=0 in Periods 1\u20134), indicating persistent shipment delays/losses; to be conservative I explicitly extend lead time to 6 periods so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. With L=6, (1+L)=7 -> expected demand over review+lead ~383.6, and current in-transit (418) covers this, avoiding urgent top-up while acknowledging delayed arrivals. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments confirmed: concluded messages Periods 1\u20134 show arrived=0 for orders placed (P1 ordered=162, P2 ordered=151, P3 ordered=105); sustained absence of arrivals over 4 periods suggests shipments delayed or lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision: Period_5 conclude shows P1 order (ordered P1) arrived in P5 => observed lead_time=4. On-hand=136, in-transit=444 => pipeline+on-hand=580 units, which covers (1+L) periods at historical mean. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4. I use default demand estimators (mu_hat and sigma_hat) because sample size is small and no sustained demand regime change is yet evident; defaults scale all-sample mean/variance by (1+L) to produce the backend base-stock while avoiding overreacting to recent noise. This balances service level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost given large existing pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-112.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=252, in-transit=293. Historical demand samples (periods 1-5) show mean=54.8; recent concluded demands (P5=26, P6=35) do not yet form a sustained new regime. Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). To reflect confirmed lead time, set L via calculate (average observed lead times). Use default demand/volatility estimators so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all, keeping the OR engine's baseline forecast and avoiding overreaction to short recent fluctuations. This balances service level (use confirmed L) against holding cost given sizable on-hand inventory and in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=264, in-transit=188; pipeline + on-hand (452) comfortably covers several periods of demand but demand samples show high variability (samples: 58,163,41,0,12). I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand sizing I use default methods so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while letting the OR engine cap orders using its cap rule. This approach is conservative given confirmed lead time and volatile demand; it avoids overreacting to the zero/low samples while preserving service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-129.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=237, in-transit=207. Concluded history shows three confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) so calculate average lead time=4. Demand has been variable; I rely on the most recent data to forecast the next (1+L)-period demand. I therefore set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using recent higher demands) against holding cost given current substantial on-hand inventory and in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-250.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10. Recent concluded history shows stable confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple orders from P1,P2,P3,P5 concluded with lead_time=4). On-hand=390, in-transit=93 (likely P8=19 + P9=74). No current evidence of new lost shipments; pipeline + on-hand is ample vs historical demand samples (mean of samples = 54.8). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (use average of concluded lead times). For demand forecast I use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to keep the OR engine anchored to full-sample mean given limited data and no sustained demand regime shift. Sigma_hat set to default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep orders conservative (cover (L+1) periods) while avoiding overreaction to short-term swings; they also rely on the confirmed lead-time evidence to prevent under-ordering if shipments consistently take 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=347, in-transit=93. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) average 54.8 units. Given confirmed L=4 and stable recent demand, use calculated lead time and default demand estimates (use all samples) so backend sets base-stock covering (1+L) periods; this balances high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by relying on full-sample mean/variance rather than overreacting to short-run noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9).

LLM Rationale:
Period 12. On-hand=109, in-transit=93 (orders P8=19 + P9=74). Historical demand samples: [58,163,41,0,12] seed; recent realized demands include a large single spike at Period 11 (238) but not yet sustained. Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmations). No evidence of new lost shipments. I choose L=calculate to lock in observed lead time from concluded history; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively\u2014this balances service level using the observed lead time while avoiding overreacting to the one-period demand spike.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=0, in-transit=263. Concluded history repeatedly shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4), and there were earlier delayed/lost shipments but current concluded arrivals confirm stable L=4. Demand has recent variability (not a sustained >3-period shift), so use default demand estimates to avoid overfitting. Parameters chosen: L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat default to let OR engine use all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (use confirmed LT=4) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=385. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (multiple P->P+4 observations). Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime starting Period_11 (demands 238,161,121) vs prior periods (mean ~69). To protect service during the higher-demand regime while accounting for confirmed LT=4, set L by calculating observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (regime length=3) so the OR engine targets stock for the new higher mean and captures recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand increased from 69 (Periods 1-10) to 173.3 (Periods 11-13), +151%

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=657. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=4 (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 11 (periods 11-13 mean ~173 vs earlier mean ~69). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to ensure backend uses confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N N=3 (Periods 12-14 demands: 161,121,117) to capture the new higher regime while keeping responsiveness to recent variability. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (protect against stockouts under higher recent demand) with holding cost by limiting the forecast horizon to the most recent regime.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=711. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and there was a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 11. Recent demands (Periods 11-15) are [238,161,121,117,96]; I use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat biases orders toward meeting the elevated demand while the OR backend caps order size; L is set to calculated average observed lead times (confirmed = 4). No new missing-shipment pattern detected beyond existing records.

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 11 (confirmed regime shift). On-hand=90, in-transit=650 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods. I set L to default (promised=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 11-16) to capture the post-change higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus ordering on the new high-demand regime while recognizing substantial pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering and reduce holding costs.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. On-hand=174, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period arrival delays (multiple orders observed with lead_time=4), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand increased starting Period 11 (higher mean); to capture the new regime use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 11\u201317, length=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This gives the OR engine a demand forecast reflecting the sustained higher demand while accounting for observed lead time so pipeline coverage (1+L) aligns with reality and reduces stockouts without excessive holding.

On-hand=361, in-transit=323 gives healthy coverage but demand since P11 remains elevated. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 11-18) to capture the post-change demand regime and updated volatility so the OR backend targets service for the higher mean while controlling holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 11 (avg up ~+151%); observed lead time consistently 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=315, in-transit=322 (pipeline=637) \u2014 no outstanding long-overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (average of concluded lead times \u22484). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201319) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=9) so sigma_hat reflects recent variance, giving the OR engine a forecast and safety stock tuned to the new higher-demand regime while avoiding overstock given sizable on-hand+pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Current on-hand=305, in-transit=274. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 11 (higher mean). I keep L as default (promised 4) since concluded history matches promised lead time. To capture the post-change higher demand I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 11\u201320) so the OR engine bases base-stock on the new regime's mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by using regime-specific demand estimates and the engine's capped order policy.

Lead time has been consistently 4 periods historically, so keep promised lead time. To capture the post-changepoint higher mean and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (Periods 11-21, length=11) so the OR engine targets service for the new demand level while avoiding excessive long-run holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=283, in-transit=344. Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9, etc.), so set L based on observed lead times. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period_11 (higher mean from P11 onward); use recent data from that regime to forecast. Set L using "calculate" to reflect observed 4-period lead time. Set mu_hat using "recent_N" with N=13 (Periods 11\u201323 regime length = 13) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast uses the higher recent mean. Set sigma_hat using "recent_N" with N=13 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods while tightening forecasts to the confirmed higher-demand regime and observed lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=264, in-transit=295. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 => critical to avoid stockouts but also limit holding. Historical concluded messages consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations), and demand history includes a sustained regime shift (higher mean after Period 11). I choose L=default (use promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms it. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable forecast that accounts for the post-shift regime using full history; this balances service-level (profit-driven) vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. On-hand=312, in-transit=228 (sufficient current coverage). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. To reflect the confirmed LT I select L by calculation from observed lead times. Demand shifted up at Period 11 and recent periods (11\u201326) define the current regime; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=16) so the OR engine bases base-stock on the higher post-shift mean and volatility, limiting stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with W=4). On-hand=306, in-transit=242 -> healthy pipeline, no obvious lost shipments. A sustained demand regime shift occurred at Period 11 (higher mean); therefore I use recent data from the post-change regime to forecast. Set L to promised (default=4). For demand I use recent_N to focus on the higher, sustained regime (N=17 covers Periods 11\u201327). Sigma also uses recent_N with same N to capture recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples, balancing service level (profit/hurt of stockouts) vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_11 (avg demand rose sharply). Current on-hand=247 + in-transit=276 provides coverage but demand remains elevated since Period_11; no new missing-shipment signal. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time average (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 11\u201328) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I use recent_N N=18 to reflect current regime variance. These choices steer the OR engine toward a base stock that prioritizes service under the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating variability from the earlier low-demand periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to firmly reflect the repeated 4-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to historical data while the backend's capped ordering will limit oversupply given holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $4).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=188, in-transit=240. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand regime increased around Period_11 and has persisted; recent 20 periods (P11\u2013P30) represent the current regime. I set L to be inferred from observations, and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current higher-demand regime and captures recent variability while respecting the observed 4-period lead time and avoiding understocking.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. On-hand=138, in-transit=325. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; past missing shipments have been resolved and arrivals since Period 5 follow L=4. Demand history shows higher mean since Period 11 but this regime is already reflected in full history. Given high profit-to-hold ratio (profit $4 vs hold $1) we favor high service; let the OR engine compute base-stock from full history. Therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so backend uses all samples (including the elevated recent demand) to set base stock. This keeps service high while letting the OR cap limit excess ordering.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded messages). On-hand=123, in-transit=334 => pipeline large relative to on-hand. Demand regime shifted up around Period 11 (higher average since then). To adapt to the higher recent demand while using proven LT=4, I set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint higher mean (use most recent 20 samples to reflect current regime and damp older low-demand periods). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime and account for current pipeline to avoid excess over-ordering while preserving service level given holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=106, in-transit=311 => pipeline+on-hand=417, which comfortably covers several periods of recent demand but we must keep provisioning for sustained higher-demand regime observed from Period 11 onward. I choose L=calculate to force the backend to use observed lead times (avg=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change higher-demand regime and recent volatility rather than diluting with much older low-demand samples. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock to recent demand while keeping sigma driven by recent variability so the OR cap limits extreme orders.

I select default for L so OR uses promised L=4. Demand has shifted historically but the last sustained changepoint was already recorded (Period 11 increase); no new 3+ period regime change since. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline coverage.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Recent history shows demand jumped at Period 11 and has remained higher; observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=38, in-transit=367 (pipeline substantial). To focus the forecast on the higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime data. Use L=default (promised lead time=4). Using recent_N=20 captures the post-change regime (capped at 20) so the OR engine builds base stock for the sustained higher mean while sigma_hat recent_N=20 reflects current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and higher demand) against holding cost by relying on recent regime stats rather than long historical low-demand periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. On-hand=39, in-transit=386. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many P\u2192P+4 observations), and earlier carry-over recorded a demand regime shift at P11; no new sustained changepoint in recent periods. Pipeline + on-hand (~425) already covers multiple periods of demand but we keep parameters conservative: set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (given high profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding manual overcorrection for short-term noise.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=48, in-transit=347 (total pipeline 395). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period 11; to reflect the post-change demand level I use a recent-window demand estimate (captures latest 20 periods of the higher regime) so the OR backend raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. Using promised lead time (default) keeps timing aligned with supplier terms and the OR cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=34, in-transit=337. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 observations). No new sustained demand regime change detected since prior insights. Use promised/confirmed lead time so OR backend aligns with observed 4-period arrivals and uses full historical demand for conservative forecasting. Choosing default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=453. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and there is a prior demand regime shift (Periods 11-13) but no new sustained change in demand or lead time in recent periods. Use default (promised) lead time handling and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this leverages all data while respecting confirmed L=4 and avoids overreacting to short-term noise. In-transit inventory will be counted by the backend when computing pipeline; no explicit corrections applied now.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=14, in-transit=447. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 confirmations) and recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (avg rose ~+151% per prior insight). Pipeline is large but on-hand low, so continue treating lead time as promised. I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained regime while capping at 20). Same recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock upward to meet high service level (q=0.8 given profit/holding) while using recent data to avoid underforecasting the sustained higher demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and no new sustained demand regime change. On-hand=24 + in-transit=393 => pipeline_inventory=417 which is sufficient to cover several periods of demand given historical flows. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed stable lead time and full historical demand statistics, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. No explicit correction for lost shipments is needed because concluded arrivals consistently match orders with L=4.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=12, in-transit=419. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals show W=4). There are no newly missing shipments. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period_11 (already recorded in carry-overs); recent demand has been in the higher regime, so I bias forecasts to recent data. Set L to promised (default=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (N=20 chosen because recent regime length >>20, capped at 20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std. This raises the base-stock to protect against stockouts under the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock responsive to recent volatility, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=114, in-transit=341. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Demand regime increased starting Period_11 and has remained elevated; to reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime. I choose L=calculate to let backend confirm observed average lead time from concluded messages (matches promised 4). This setup biases orders toward the recent higher-demand regime while the backend's capped policy limits order size to control holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Current context: on-hand=71, in-transit=315. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and no recent lost-shipment signal. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift upward around Period 11 (noted in carry-over). I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) because concluded history confirms it. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, leveraging the full historical demand (including the post-Period-11 higher regime) to set base stock while the backend's capping will limit order size. This balances service level (capture higher sustained demand) against holding cost given current sizable pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49. Current on-hand=16, in-transit=416. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmed P\u2192P+4 arrivals) and earlier missing shipments have been resolved; pipeline appears healthy. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period_11 (avg up markedly vs Periods 1-10). To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility, taking N=20 (captures most recent stable regime while capping at 20). I leave L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms 4. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock toward recent higher demand, reducing stockouts while the cap limits over-ordering and holding costs.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Recent demand has stabilized near ~100 units/period (last 5: 105,63,128,105,91). On-hand=44 + in-transit=397 => pipeline=441, which already covers multiple periods of demand under L=4. Use promised lead time (default=4). Use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent regime and avoid long-tail older data; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base-stock to recent demand while the large pipeline reduces short-term stockout risk.
