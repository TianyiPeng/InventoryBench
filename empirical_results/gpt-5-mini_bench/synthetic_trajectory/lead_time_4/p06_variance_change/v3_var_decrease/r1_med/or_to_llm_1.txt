Decision logic: pipeline (162) already exceeds OR\u2019s cap (~161) and is close to the single-period mean and will likely arrive (unless shipment is lost). Placing a large order now risks high holding cost ($1/unit/period) if the pipeline arrives and demand stays at historical mean. Given no confirmed arrivals yet (no concluded arrival evidence) and only one period of realized demand, I avoid adding inventory until I can observe whether the in-transit 162 actually arrives or is lost. Final strategy: order 0 this period to avoid excess holding cost and wait one period for conclude message confirming arrival/loss; reassess next period with updated pipeline and any concluded arrivals. This keeps risk of overstock low while accepting the risk of potential stockouts if the in-transit shipment is lost (which would then trigger more aggressive orders once loss is confirmed).",
