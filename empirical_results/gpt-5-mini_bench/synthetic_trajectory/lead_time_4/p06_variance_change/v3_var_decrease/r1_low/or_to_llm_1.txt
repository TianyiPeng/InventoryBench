Therefore there is no confirmed lead-time deviation or lost-shipment signal yet.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 274. Historical observed demands (concludes): Period1=56, Period2=106, Period3=71 \u2192 recent mean \u2248 77.7 units/period. OR recommends 43 units (uses promised L and full history). With L=4, (L+1)=5-period expected demand \u2248 388 units; current in-transit 274 covers ~3.5 periods of recent mean demand.

I will monitor Period 5/6 concludes for actual arrival to reassess and then follow a replenishment to cover any remaining gap to the (L+1)-period demand.
