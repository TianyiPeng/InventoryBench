No special events to expect. \n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Use the provided historical samples for chips(Regular): Period_1=100, P2=69, P3=92, P4=77, P5=111. The 5-period average = 449/5 = 89.8 \u2248 90 units/period. No evidence of a sustained shift or trend in the small sample\u2014variation is moderate around ~90.\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. There are currently no in-transit orders and no concluded arrivals to contradict the promise. Therefore assume the promised lead time (4 periods) until contrary evidence is observed. Remember that an order placed now will arrive during Period 5 (N+4) and only be visible in the Period 6 conclude message.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. To avoid stockouts we should cover current-period demand plus the next 4 periods' demand because arrivals occur after those demands. That is (L+1) = 5 periods of demand must be covered by on-hand + in-transit + order placed now.\n\ne) Final order logic: Forecast 90 units/period \xd7 5 periods = 450 units. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit; excess inventory carries high carrying cost relative to profit, so avoid over-ordering. Ordering 450 units balances service (avoid stockouts) with holding costs. Given zero on-hand and zero pipeline, place order = 450 units now so shipments arriving per promised lead time will allow continuity after the pipeline fills. Monitor concluded arrivals in future periods to confirm lead time and adjust.\n\nSummary decision: Order 450 units to cover the next 5 periods at the estimated mean demand (~90/period).",

These orders are not yet reported as arrived in any conclude message, but they are expected to arrive during Period 5 (orders from P1 arrive in P5 if actual lead time = 4).

Product is regular chips (everyday snack) \u2014 stable, no holiday effect expected for these data.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Use recent realized demand as primary guide. Historical seed demands (Period_1\u20135) were around 70\u2013100, but realized recent periods (P5\u2013P11) average = 71.3 units/period (sum 499 over 7 periods). There is some recent uptick in the last two periods (83, 95), but not a sustained >3-period regime shift. I therefore use a cautious forecast of ~80 units/period for the next few periods (balanced between longer-term ~71 and recent uptick).\n\nc) Lead time and pipeline: Carry-over confirmed lead time = 4 periods. That means an order placed now (Period 12) will arrive during Period 16 and only be visible in the Period 16 conclude message (read at Period 17). Therefore we must cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods (Periods 12\u201316) from existing on-hand + in-transit.

Available before new arrival = 261 -> shortfall \u2248 139 units. To avoid lost sales during the 5-period window we should order at least enough to cover this shortfall. However, because holding cost equals profit ($1 per unit), excess ending inventory immediately reduces objective as much as a sold unit increases it. So I order conservatively to cover the forecast shortfall plus a small buffer.\n\ne) Final order logic: Place an order to bring pipeline roughly to the 5-period demand estimate. I choose to order 100 units now: it meaningfully reduces the shortfall (261+100=361 vs. estimated 400) while avoiding large overstock risk given equal profit/holding cost and uncertainty in demand.

In-transit total = 355 with 152 arriving this period (will be available to satisfy Period_40 demand after arrival resolution). Total available across pipeline = 42 + 355 = 397. e) Order logic: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (P40..P44). Forecasted 5-period demand \u2248 5 \xd7 91 = 455 units. Current pipeline available (397) leaves a shortfall \u2248 58 units. Because orders placed now will arrive in Period_44 (N+4) and will cover P44 demand, we should order to cover the shortfall. Given integer ordering and modest demand variability, I place an order of 60 units to cover the shortfall while limiting holding cost exposure.",
