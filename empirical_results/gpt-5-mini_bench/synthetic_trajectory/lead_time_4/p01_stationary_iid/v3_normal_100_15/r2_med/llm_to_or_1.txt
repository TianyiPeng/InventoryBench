Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory for chips(Regular). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5): [88,133,93,108,110], mean \u2248 106.4, std \u2248 15.7. Promised lead time is 4 periods and no concluded arrivals exist yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred. With zero inventory and a 4-period promised lead time, we must cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I choose default methods so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This uses the full history (conservative given no evidence of a regime change) and aligns ordering to cover five periods of expected demand while letting the backend balance service level vs. holding cost using profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Observed on-hand=0 and in-transit=136 (this is the order placed in Period_1). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 expected because promised lead time is 4 periods, so an order placed in Period_1 should arrive during Period_5 (conclusion visible in Period_6). Demand history (all samples): [88,133,93,108,110], mean=106.4. I see no sustained changepoint in demand or confirmed lead-time deviation (only one outstanding order and no concluded arrivals beyond promised lead time), so I will use the default, conservative settings. Set L to promised lead time (default) so the OR backend assumes L=4. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 5\xd7106.4 -> 532 expected demand across review+lead. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) (~39.4). These defaults give the backend a demand forecast and safety buffer calibrated to historical variability while we wait for concluded arrivals to confirm or refute the promised lead time. This approach avoids overreacting to a single outstanding shipment and balances service level vs holding cost until more evidence appears.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand = 0, In-transit = 268 (136+132 ordered in P1 and P2). No concluded arrivals yet (only Period 1 and 2 conclude messages available) so we have no evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. Promised L=4 remains the prudent choice. I therefore use default lead time so the OR backend uses the promised lead time. Demand history (chips(Regular) samples provided) shows no sustained changepoint in mean/variance across the full sample set, so I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std using all samples. This balances service level (use full-sample demand estimate) against holding cost; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to limited concluded data while the large in-transit position (268) will be accounted for by the pipeline inventory term in the ordering calculation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 398 (these are the three outstanding orders: 136+132+130). No concluded arrivals have been observed yet (Period 1-3 conclude show arrived=0), so there is no confirmed change to actual lead time \u2014 we must treat promised lead time as valid for parameter selection. Demand history shows recent demands around ~90\u2013110 per period; no sustained regime shift is evident from available concluded periods. To balance service level vs. holding cost, use the default lead time and default demand forecasts so the OR backend uses the promised L and the full-sample mean/variance for (1+L) aggregation. This avoids overreacting to missing conclude messages (which may simply reflect on-time arrivals later) while the existing in-transit stock (398) should cover several periods of demand once arrivals are concluded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start. On-hand=0, In-transit=526 which equals the sum of orders placed in Periods 1-4 (136+132+130+128). No 'arrived' confirmations have appeared in concluded messages yet, but that is EXPECTED given the promised lead time=4 (orders placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5 and only be visible in the Period 5 conclude). There is therefore no confirmed lead-time deviation or lost shipment evidence yet. Demand history (all available samples) will be used to forecast. To balance service level vs holding cost conservatively, use the backend defaults: keep L as promised (default) and let mu_hat and sigma_hat be computed from all samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock aligned with the historical demand distribution and the promised lead time while avoiding overreaction to expected-but-not-yet-concluded arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Recent concluded history (Period 5 conclude) shows the order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4, confirming actual lead time equals the promised 4 periods. Current on-hand = 53 and in-transit = 417 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 470 units. Using concluded demand history (Periods 1-5 demands: 90, 106, 102, 117, 83) the mean demand \u2248 99.6 units/period. With confirmed L=4, the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods, so default mu_hat and sigma_hat (which the backend will compute as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) are appropriate. Rationale for choices: 1) L set to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (we have direct evidence of 4); 2) demand shows no sustained regime shift (5 periods of reasonably consistent demand around \u2248100), so using the default all-sample aggregator keeps the forecast stable; 3) default sigma captures historical volatility across the full sample and scales with the (1+L) horizon. Given large pipeline (470 units) relative to 5-period expected demand (~498 units forecast by default calculation), this configuration balances service level (profit-weighted stock) against holding cost while accounting for confirmed lead time and observed demand variability. If future concludes show missing arrivals or a different lead time, I will update L and consider recent_N or explicit adjustments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: P1 arrival lead_time=4; Period 6 conclude: P2 arrival lead_time=4). Recent realized demands (Periods 1-5) average 106.4 units/period. Current inventory position: on-hand=129, in-transit=359 \u2192 total pipeline+on-hand=488 units. With promised/confirmed L=4, the (1+L) review horizon is 5 periods, so the default (1+L)*mean forecast = 5 * 106.4 = 532 units across review+lead. Pipeline+on-hand (488) is slightly below that forecast, so the OR engine will likely order to refill toward the base stock. I choose to rely on confirmed historical averages (no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift beyond the 5-sample history) and the backend's default computations for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and volatility scaled by (1+L). Using L='calculate' (average observed lead times) encodes the confirmed lead time into the OR model. This conservative approach balances service (using the 5-period coverage) vs holding cost given the moderate holding cost ($1) and profit ($4). If future periods show sustained demand or lead-time shifts, I'll update to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision. Recent history shows realized demands are moderate and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods for the concluded orders (orders placed in P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Current inventory: on-hand=160, in-transit=273. With confirmed lead time=4, the pipeline plus on-hand covers several periods of expected demand; no shipments appear lost. I therefore set L using the observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed reality rather than relying only on the promise. For demand parameters I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because there is no strong, sustained demand regime shift in the last periods that would justify a recent_N or EWMA change. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to the full-sample demand statistics, balancing service level (by accounting for the 5-period review+lead horizon) against holding cost. If future conclude messages show a new sustained change in demand or lead time, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages show orders from Periods 1\u20134 arriving in Periods 5\u20138 with lead_time=4). Current on-hand = 200, in-transit = 243. Historical demand samples provided for chips(Regular): [88,133,93,108,110] (mean = 106.4 units/period). With promised lead time 4 and confirmed actual lead time 4, review+lead coverage = 1+L = 5 periods. Using the default demand aggregation keeps the OR engine aligned with long-run sample mean ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd7106.4 \u2248 532 units) and default volatility will scale by sqrt(1+L). On-hand + in-transit = 443 units, which currently covers most of the 5-period expected demand (~532) but leaves a modest shortfall; the OR backend's capped ordering policy will compute an order to top up toward the computed base stock while respecting caps. I choose to let the backend use the empirically calculated lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine uses the full-sample statistics (no recent changepoint detected in demand). This approach balances service (using confirmed L=4 and full-sample mean to avoid understock) against holding cost by relying on the backend's z* and cap calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $243.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: demand history for chips(Regular) shows samples [88,133,93,108,110] (mean=106.4, std~15.8). On-hand=133, in-transit=298. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (Period 5\u20139 arrivals correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). No evidence of lost shipments. Given confirmed 4-period actual lead time and stable demand over the 5 samples, I choose to have the OR engine compute lead time from observed data and use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend will set base-stock = (1+L)*mean + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. This keeps the forecast anchored to all available samples (no recent changepoint detected) and uses the full-sample volatility, which balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the risk-target z. Using calculate for L ensures the backend uses the observed lead-time average (4) rather than simply trusting the promise. Default mu/sigma use all samples scaled by (1+L) so the order recommendation will cover the review+lead horizon and avoid stockouts while limiting excessive holding costs given existing large in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=77, in-transit=316. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10). Demand history through Period_10 shows variability but no sustained regime shift (recent 5-period mean ~93.4 vs earlier mean ~99.6). Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high target service level (q ~ 0.8). I therefore set L to be inferred from observed leads (calculate) to ensure the OR engine uses the confirmed 4-period actual lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because there is no clear sustained demand regime change requiring recent-window or EWMA adjustments. This keeps the backend's base-stock estimate aligned with historical demand while the confirmed lead-time estimate reduces stockouts caused by lead-time mis-specification.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 start. Recent confirmed lead time = 4 periods (see concluded arrivals P5-P11 all show lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=17, in-transit=404 \u2192 pipeline=421. Historical demand samples show some downward drift from the earliest five-sample seed; recent 5-period demand (P7-P11 = 99,88,94,130,104) has mean=103.0. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. I choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect the confirmed actual lead time (calculate -> 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the most recent regime (captures latest demand mean = 103 per period \u2192 mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 5*103 = 515). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so safety stock reflects recent variability rather than older samples. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for current realized lead time and recent demand while avoiding overweighting early-period high samples; given pipeline (421) vs forecasted 5-period demand (\u2248515) we will prompt replenishment to cover the shortfall while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 summary: confirmed lead time = 4 periods from prior concludes. Historical sample mean demand = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Current inventory: on-hand=33, in-transit=431 \u2192 total pipeline+on-hand = 464 units. Requirement for (1+L)=5 periods demand \u2248 5\xd7106.4 = 532 units, so current position is short by \u224868 units. No recent evidence of lost shipments; concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. Given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (high service target q\u22480.8), I keep lead time set to the observed average and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean + z\xb7\u03c3. This yields an ordering policy that targets covering 5 periods of demand with an appropriate safety buffer while acknowledging holding cost. Using defaults avoids overfitting to short-term noise and lets the backend apply its capped order cap.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 context: recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) shows stable demand with no abrupt sustained regime shifts; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods across multiple concluded orders. Current inventory: on-hand=18, in-transit=415 (pipeline=433). Expected review+lead horizon = 1+L = 5 periods. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (confirmed as 4) rather than the promised default\u2014this captures the reliable evidence from multiple conclude messages. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demands: Periods 9\u201313 = 94,130,104,82,97) to make the forecast responsive to the most recent demand mix (mean \u2248 101.4); mu_hat will thus reflect (1+L)\xd7recent_mean for the 5-period replenishment horizon and avoid overweighting much older early-period samples. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent variability. This configuration balances service (using recent demand to set base stock) against holding costs given the already-large pipeline (433 units) and the product economics (profit $4, holding $1). The recent_N choice reduces risk of over-ordering from older high-volume periods while still provisioning for short-term demand; using calculated L ensures the OR engine accounts for the confirmed 4-period transit behavior rather than assuming a different promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 start. Recent demand has been stable in the 80\u2013130 range (history shows demands: P1\u2013P14 as recorded; historical seed samples P1\u2013P5: 88,133,93,108,110). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 431 units (these are orders from Periods 11\u201314: 132+125+66+108 = 431). Concluded arrivals show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods for all observed concluded orders (orders placed in P1\u2013P10 arrived with W=4). Given that, I set L using the observed data (calculate) to reflect actual lead time rather than the promised value if it differed. Demand appears stationary without a sustained changepoint (no 3+ period shift in mean/variance), so I use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat (the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples). This keeps the base-stock anchored to the full-sample demand estimate, which is appropriate given stable demand and avoids overreacting to single-period noise. With on-hand zero but a large pipeline (431) that will arrive across upcoming periods, these parameters provide the OR engine a balanced base-stock target that trades off the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost per unit-period to achieve a reasonable service level without excessive extra inventory.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: recent concluded history shows a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (many concluded arrivals: orders from Periods 1-11 all reported lead_time=4). Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5 provided) have mean 106.4 and moderate variability. Current inventory: on-hand=34, in-transit=399 \u2014 a very large pipeline relative to demand, so risk of high holding cost if base stock is set too high. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 implies a high target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) so the OR backend will choose a relatively high z*. Given the confirmed, stable lead time and limited recent demand data, I choose to let the backend compute lead time- and demand-adjusted forecasts using its defaults: calculate L from observations (will confirm as 4), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat which scale the sample mean and std by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. This keeps our forecast grounded in all available demand data, avoids overreacting to short-term noise, and leverages the backend's cap on order size to prevent excessive single-period ordering despite the large in-transit volume. If pipeline remains large in future periods, I will switch to a reduced mu_hat (recent_N or explicit) to limit holding costs.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages show orders placed P1..P12 arriving after 4 periods). Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean \u2248106.4 units/period and moderate variability. Current inventory: on-hand=61, in-transit=371 \u2192 pipeline total = 432 units. Expected demand over review+lead (L+1 = 5 periods) using sample mean \u2248 5 \xd7 106.4 = 532 units, so current pipeline is roughly 100 units short of the 5-period expected demand; however, lead time behavior is stable (no lost shipments), so we should rely on the historical mean to size safety stock rather than aggressively increase forecast. Profit $4 vs holding $1 gives q = 0.8, implying a high target service level; using the full-sample default forecast and volatility keeps the OR engine's base-stock high enough to meet service targets while not overreacting to short-term noise. I select L='calculate' to lock in the observed lead time average (4), and use the backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances high service level (to capture profit) against holding costs and leverages the consistent 4-period lead time evidence.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: on-hand=23, in-transit=402, historical sample demands (periods 1-5) mean=106.4; profit=$4, holding=$1. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P13 arrived with lead_time=4), and current large in-transit (402) plus low on-hand means pipeline already covers several periods. I choose L using 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (all concluded lead times = 4) so the OR engine treats lead time as 4. For demand forecast I select 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 this yields mu_hat = 5\xd7mean(sample) (covers the review+lead horizon) and a volatility consistent with historical variability. This conservative, data-driven choice ensures the backend sets a base-stock that balances high profit (driving service level up) against holding cost, while the existing large in-transit inventory will prevent excessive new ordering under the OR cap.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: on-hand=15, in-transit=398, historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (confirmed in multiple conclude messages). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-18 in concludes) averages near the initial sample set. Pipeline is large (398) so immediate stockouts are unlikely, but holding cost is non-trivial. I choose to let the OR backend use the observed lead time (calculate) so the engine uses realized delivery behavior rather than the promise. For demand forecast and volatility I select the defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This is conservative: it leverages all available demand history to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations while the large in-transit pipeline already provides cover. The choices balance service (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost by not inflating safety stock with aggressive recent-only estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $445.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Demand context: historical sample mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Promised lead time = 4 periods; arrivals in concluded history consistently show actual lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand = 3, in-transit = 418 -> pipeline inventory = 421. Using L = promised (4) keeps model aligned with confirmed lead time and the OR engine's assumptions. I select mu_hat = default so backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples = 5 * 106.4 = 532 (demand across review+lead). With pipeline 421 < mu_hat 532, this signals the OR engine to replenish to cover the (L+1)-period demand. I select sigma_hat = default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) (captures observed variability across samples scaled for lead+review). These defaults are conservative and consistent with the confirmed 4-period lead time, letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and the capped order amount to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff. Because many units are already in-transit (418), using the default formulas ensures the policy accounts for pipeline inventory while avoiding over-reacting to short-term noise.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent observed demand samples (Periods 1-5) average 106.4 units/period. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 435 units (sizable pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed earlier arrived after 4 periods), matching the promised lead time. Given confirmed stable lead time and no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift (recent demand samples are limited but show no persistent jump), I choose to use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L) scaling. This leverages the large pipeline (435) to avoid over-ordering while keeping service level via the backend's base-stock calculation. Using defaults keeps parameters consistent with confirmed lead time and the full-sample demand statistics, balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) through the backend's q-based safety stock.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: observed demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples: 88,133,93,108,110; mean = 106.4). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages (every observed arrival shows lead_time = 4). Current inventory: on-hand = 1, in-transit = 442 (large pipeline). Given the confirmed lead time and stable demand samples, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use the default aggregate forecast (1+L times mean of all samples) so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean (conservative given the small sample set). Volatility is left at default so the backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). This combination keeps orders aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time, avoids overreacting to short-term noise, and leverages the large in-transit pipeline to limit new ordering (the OR engine will cap orders using its cap formula).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 432. Historical demand samples provided (chips(Regular)) have mean = (88+133+93+108+110)/5 = 106.4 units/period. Many concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time = 4 periods. Pipeline (in-transit 432) currently covers roughly 4+1 =5 periods at ~106.4 \u2192 ~532 units required to fully cover review+lead demand; current pipeline 432 is below that full coverage so the OR policy should target the full (L+1)-period demand. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (all concluded lead times = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L=4 this yields mu_hat \u22485\xd7106.4=532 (backend will compute) which matches the intuitive required pipeline. This balances service level and holding cost: using the full-sample mean keeps the forecast stable (no short, noisy recent-changepoint detected) while the OR engine will apply the z* safety stock calibration given profit/holding (profit=4, holding=1 implies moderate service target). I flag that current pipeline (432) is somewhat short of the implied target (~532), so expected orders should bring inventory up to near the base-stock target, but not excessively increase holding cost because sigma is computed from full history. No evidence of a recent demand regime shift (no sustained >3 period change); lead time has been confirmed at 4 and will be used.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 context: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods for many arrivals (orders placed in Periods 1-19 all arrived after 4 periods). Demand samples provided (Periods 1-5) have mean = 106.4 units/period; no clear regime shift in the demand samples or recent concluded demand pattern that would justify deviating from the long-run sample estimate. Current inventory: on-hand = 34, in-transit = 418 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with steady arrivals under a 4-period lead time, so no evidence of lost shipments or unexplained delays. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm lead_time=4. For forecasting I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to the historical demand mean (avoids overreacting to short-term noise) while the backend cap prevents excessive single-period orders given the large current pipeline. This balances service-level (profit > holding cost so q > 0.5) with holding cost exposure given the already-large in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 context: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period implies a high target service level (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8). Recent confirmed information: observed arrivals in concluded periods consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages show orders placed in P1..P20 arriving after 4 periods). On-hand = 48 and in-transit = 387 (total pipeline + on-hand = 435) which covers many future periods given historical demand. Historical sample mean (provided samples: 88,133,93,108,110) = 106.4 units/period. Given the sustained, consistent evidence that actual lead time equals the promised 4 periods (no recent deviations or lost shipments), I set L using the calculate method so backend uses observed lead times. For demand I use the default aggregation: mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) which yields (1+4)*106.4 = 532 (backend will compute). Volatility is left to default so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std(all samples). Rationale: using calculate for L captures the confirmed 4-period lead time from concluded messages; default mu_hat and sigma_hat leverage all available historical samples to produce a stable base-stock given the long lead time and high service-level target. This balances service (avoid stockouts given profit>holding) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the z* from profit/holding and cap the order size appropriately. No evidence of a recent demand regime shift or lost shipments requiring an explicit override.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 context: recent observed demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean = 106.4 units/period and std (sample) based on those five samples. On-hand = 66, in-transit = 382 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 448 units. Promised lead time = 4; historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time. Inventory coverage: (L+1)=5 periods \xd7 mean demand 106.4 \u2192 target mu_hat \u2248 532 units for the review+lead period. Current pipeline (448) is below that target by ~84 units, so an order is warranted to restore the target. Decision logic: 1) L set by calculate to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time from concluded history (consistent observations). 2) mu_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean using all historical samples \u2014 this yields a conservative target aligned with observed demand (\u2248532). 3) sigma_hat set to default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), giving appropriate safety-stock scaling for lead+review period. These choices (calculate + default + default) let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances the profit/holding tradeoff using confirmed lead-time evidence and all available demand data; using all samples keeps volatility estimates stable given only five demand samples and no recent sustained regime shift. This also addresses potential missing shipments: because concluded history confirms consistent 4-period arrivals, we rely on the observed lead time rather than the promised lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods from historical conclude messages (many orders show lead_time=4). Historical sample mean demand = 106.4 (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Current visible inventory: on-hand=79, in-transit=372 => pipeline + on-hand = 451 units. With promised/confirmed L=4, the review+lead horizon is 1+L = 5 periods; default forecast for that horizon is 5 * mean = 532 units. Pipeline+on-hand (451) is below the 5-period demand expectation (532), so we should replenish to cover the 5-period demand. Given consistent historical lead time evidence (all observed lead times = 4), I use the calculate method for L to let the backend confirm average observed lead time. For demand I choose the default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples so the backend targets the full 5-period demand; sigma_hat remains default to reflect historical variability. This configuration balances service (cover 5 periods of demand given confirmed L=4) against holding cost: using full-horizon mean avoids understock given heavy in-transit but still leverages historical variance in the backend cap to limit excessive ordering.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows stable, regular demand with no sustained regime shift; carry-over already confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 6 insight). Current inventory: on-hand=89, in-transit=344. With L=4 the pipeline plus on-hand (433 units) covers multiple periods of demand given historical mean demand \u2248106.4 (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). I select L by 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time rather than trusting only the promise; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by relying on full-sample estimates and the confirmed lead time; no new overdue/lost shipments are detected in recent conclude messages, so no explicit inflation of demand or lead time is needed.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29. Historical demand samples (periods 1-5) show values [88,133,93,108,110] with mean = 106.4 units/period. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concluded messages (Period 6 insight), so I will use the promised/default lead time. Current inventory: on-hand = 53, in-transit = 356, total pipeline = 409 units. Forecasted demand over review+lead (1+L = 5 periods) using the sample mean is 5 * 106.4 = 532 units, so the current pipeline (409) is short of the 5-period demand by ~123 units \u2014 we should allow the OR engine to compute the exact order quantity using its base-stock formula. I choose default methods so the backend uses the full-sample statistics (mean and std) and the confirmed promised lead time; this is appropriate because demand history is limited but stable, and confirmed lead time matches the promise. Using defaults balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base-stock from the full-sample mean and variance and the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_30. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with lead_time = 4 periods (many confirmed arrivals), so I rely on observed lead-time signal. Current inventory: on-hand = 52, in-transit = 379 (pipeline = 431). Target coverage per default formula is (1+L) \xd7 mean demand; with L=4 that is 5 \xd7 106.4 = 532 units. Pipeline+on-hand (431) is below that target, so the OR backend should replenish. Decisions: set L to "calculate" so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (which are consistently 4); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples respectively. This balances service level (using confirmed 4-period lead time and full-sample mean) against holding costs; given pipeline is currently below the (1+L) coverage, the capped ordering rule will generate replenishment while respecting the cap to limit over-ordering.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31.

On-hand = 26, in-transit = 394 so pipeline + on-hand is large relative to recent demand \u2014 no evidence of lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the empirically observed lead time (will average observed lead times = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to the full-sample statistics and avoids overreacting to short-term noise given the large pipeline.

Pipeline + on-hand (447) comfortably covers several periods of typical demand, and there are no overdue/lost shipments visible. I select default lead time (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals consistently indicate L=4. I also choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, respectively. This keeps forecasting conservative and leverages full-sample statistics given no recent persistent demand regime change; it balances service level (by using full-sample mean across the review+lead period) against holding cost through the backend's z*/cap logic.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_33. Demand context: historical sample mean = 106.4 (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). On-hand = 33, in-transit = 414. Past concluded history repeatedly shows actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent across many concluded arrivals). Pipeline + on-hand (447 units) currently covers several periods of expected demand, but we must keep safety stock for variability. I therefore set L using observed lead times (calculate) to ensure the OR backend uses the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I selected default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps parameters aligned with the long-run samples while leveraging the confirmed lead time; it balances service level (through base-stock computed from sample mean and variability) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts with short-term noise.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Demand has been stable around ~100-120 units per period over the observed history; the sample mean from the provided seed data is 106.4 units/period. On-hand = 32, in-transit = 372 \u2192 total pipeline = 404 units. With an estimated period demand \u2248106.4, current pipeline covers ~3.8 periods of demand (404 / 106.4), which is below the (L+1)=5 period coverage target; this suggests the optimizer should be allowed to raise orders to restore a 5-period coverage. Historical conclude messages consistently show a 4-period realized lead time (confirmed repeatedly), so I use the observed lead-time estimate rather than the promised-only fallback. I choose: L via calculate (so backend uses average observed lead times), mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This keeps forecasting anchored to the full-sample statistics while allowing the OR backend's capped policy to size incremental orders to trade off $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. No evidence of lost shipments or abrupt demand regime shifts requiring an immediate explicit override.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: orders placed on P1..P30 all arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand = 54, in-transit = 399 \u2192 pipeline inventory is very large relative to typical demand. Historical demand samples (seed) mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). With promised lead time 4 and confirmed actual = 4, the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods. I choose to let the OR backend compute base stock from the data rather than forcing a short-term recent adjustment because demand has been stable around ~100 units and there is a very large pipeline (453 total units available+in-transit) that already covers several periods of demand. Using L = calculate ensures the backend uses observed lead times (confirmed = 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set; this is conservative given stable demand and avoids overreacting to single-period variability. This combination reduces the risk of over-ordering (holding cost $1/unit) while preserving service via the backend's profit-driven service level (profit $4/unit favors decent service). Given the large in-transit stock, no aggressive increase in mu_hat is needed now.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (multiple conclude messages: orders placed in P1..P31 arrived after 4 periods), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will equal 4). Current inventory: on-hand=72, in-transit=363 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to one-period demand samples, so no emergency replenishment needed. Demand samples provided (88,133,93,108,110) give a mean ~106.4; using the default mu_hat and sigma_hat (which scale the sample mean and std by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L), respectively) provides a base-stock that balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) via the backend formula. Using 'calculate' for L ensures we rely on confirmed lead-time evidence rather than the promise; default for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses all samples to avoid overreacting to short-term noise given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: historical sample mean (Periods 1-5) = 106.4 units/period; no calendar seasonality or special events indicated. On-hand = 62, in-transit = 373. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods for many periods (orders placed earlier consistently arrived after 4 periods), so using observed lead time is appropriate. I choose L via "calculate" so the backend will confirm average observed lead time (which is 4). For demand forecast I use the default method: mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) which equals 5 \xd7 106.4 = 532 units (backend will compute). Rationale: default uses all historical samples and matches the long, stable regime seen in the 5-sample history; there is no strong recent changepoint requiring downweighting. For sigma_hat I choose default so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), preserving observed variability over the full sample. These choices instruct the OR engine to target the analytical base-stock derived from the full-sample mean and variance while using the empirically observed lead time; with on-hand 62 and large in-transit (373) we expect the pipeline to cover several periods of demand, so defaults avoid overreacting and keep holding cost reasonable while maintaining service given the observed 4-period lead time. If future conclude messages show missing or delayed arrivals, I will switch to an explicit longer L and re-evaluate mu_hat.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Recent realized lead time is consistently 4 periods (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=4). Current on-hand = 38, in-transit = 384 \u2014 generous pipeline relative to typical demand. Historical demand sample set provided (88,133,93,108,110) has mean 106.4; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods, so default forecasting ((1+L)\xd7mean) yields ~532 expected demand over the horizon. I choose to use a lead time estimate computed from observed arrivals (calculate) to confirm the actual 4-period lead time rather than the blind default; for demand and volatility I use the defaults so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This keeps parameters consistent with the confirmed stable lead time and historical demand, avoids over-reacting to short-term fluctuations, and leverages the large in-transit stock to prevent excess incremental ordering while maintaining service level.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39. Recent history shows a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: Periods 5\u201338 all report lead_time=4). Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean = 106.4 units and std \u2248 17.92; (1+L)=5 so the (1+L)\xd7mean demand forecast \u2248 532 units. Current inventory: on-hand=50, in-transit=362 (pipeline total 412). With promised lead time = 4 and confirmed actual lead time = 4, I choose to let the OR backend use its default demand aggregation and volatility estimates so it can compute base_stock consistent with its statistical model and the promised lead time. Using defaults avoids overfitting to a small sample window and leverages the backend's cap formula to limit order size given observed variability. This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding trade-off (profit=$4, holding=$1), while relying on the backend to cap orders to prevent excessive holding costs given the large existing pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40 context: on-hand=33, in-transit=403, profit=$4, holding=$1. History of concluded arrivals shows every concluded order that arrived had lead_time=4 (consistent across many periods), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. Pipeline (403) plus on-hand (33) gives ample cover for several periods of demand; however we must still provide parameters that the OR engine (which only knows promised lead time) can use to maintain service while controlling holding costs. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the observed actual lead time (average of observed lead times = 4). For demand and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leverages the full historical demand sample set (stable demand without a recent regime shift) so the base-stock policy balances a high service level (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.8) against holding cost, while the capped order size will limit excessive single-period ordering despite the large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=15, in-transit=401, profit=$4/unit, holding=$1/unit/period. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (orders consistently arrived 4 periods after ordering). Pipeline is large (401) so risk is holding cost; current on-hand is low but substantial pipeline will arrive. To balance service level vs holding cost I use the backend defaults: keep promised lead time (default) and allow the OR engine to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all available demand samples so base-stock and cap reflect long-run demand uncertainty. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise and leverages the confirmed lead-time evidence encoded in concluded history. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is required because concluded history consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 context: demand history (5 samples) shows mean 106.4 units/period; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=27, in-transit=415. With promised lead time 4 and observed confirmations, I set L via 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (which is 4) rather than the naive promised value\u2014this aligns planning with realized delivery timing. I use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because the 5-sample history shows no recent sustained demand regime shift requiring a shorter recent window or EWMA; default uses all available samples to produce mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std. Rationale vs. inventory: on-hand + in-transit = 442 which already covers multiple periods' demand given mu_hat \u2248 532 over review+lead; however profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high service-level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) so the OR engine will compute a relatively high base stock. Using 'calculate' for L and defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the optimizer produce the appropriate base stock while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; it also acknowledges the confirmed 4-period lead time so we won't under-order and risk stockouts. If future conclude messages show lead-time deviations or a sustained change in demand, I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=45, in-transit=382. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (many orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P39\u2192P43), so the supply process is stable and not lost. Recent long history of demand (samples provided) has mean \u2248106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). With promised lead time = 4 and confirmed actual lead time = 4, the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods. Current pipeline (in-transit=382) plus on-hand (45) equals 427 units, which covers roughly 4.0 periods of expected demand at the sample mean (427 / 106.4 \u2248 4.01). That means we presently have about one review+lead period of cover but not a large buffer beyond the 5-period horizon; ordering should target the OR engine's base-stock calculation rather than manual explicit increases. Decisions: set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (backend will average observed lead times); use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages the confirmed 4-period lead time and the provided demand samples to produce a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff. Using defaults avoids overreacting to short-term noise given stable lead-time evidence and substantial pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Historic concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: orders placed on Period t arrive in Period t+4). Current on-hand = 24, in-transit = 390 (large pipeline). Demand samples provided (5 samples: 88,133,93,108,110) have mean = 106.4 and std \u2248 17.61. I choose L by calculate so the OR backend uses the observed average lead time (confirming promised L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default: (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively so the backend computes a forecast that properly covers the review+lead horizon using all sample history. This conservative choice trusts the sustained lead-time evidence and the full-sample demand statistics; given large in-transit inventory, the policy will cap orders via the OR engine cap, avoiding excess ordering while maintaining service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 context: profits $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand = 28, in-transit = 391 \u2192 total available = 419. Using the provided historical demand samples (88,133,93,108,110) the sample mean \u2248 106.4 units/period, so demand over (1+L)=5 periods \u2248 532 units. Pipeline + on-hand (419) is currently short of the next (L+1) periods' expected demand, so the OR engine should be instructed with demand and uncertainty that reflect the established regime and the confirmed 4-period lead time. I choose to have the backend compute L from observed lead times to confirm the persistent 4-period reality (method: calculate) and to use the default demand forecasting rules for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples; this is appropriate because demand appears stationary without a recent changepoint and the sample set is small but representative. These settings balance service level (avoid stockouts given pipeline shortfall) against holding cost by relying on the backend's base-stock formula which incorporates profit vs holding cost tradeoff.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: chips(Regular) profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period. Observed demand history shows regular demands around ~80\u2013130 historically; recent full history (Periods 1\u201346) exhibits no sustained demand regime shift. On-hand = 44, in-transit = 401 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded messages with lead_time=4). I select L via calculate so the OR backend uses the empirically observed lead time (average of observed lead times \u2248 4). For demand forecast and volatility I choose the default aggregation: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). Given the large pipeline (401) and modest on-hand, the default (all-sample) forecast provides stability and avoids overreacting to short-term noise; using the empirical lead time ensures the backend sizes orders to cover the full (L+1) review+lead horizon. This balances service (profit-driven high critical ratio) against holding costs by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock with the profit/holding tradeoff built into its z* calculation while using historically grounded demand moments and observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 context: promised lead time = 4 periods and historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand samples (provided) have mean 106.4 units/period and no sustained regime shift is evident. Current inventory: on-hand=15, in-transit=398 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=413. (L+1)=5 periods of demand forecast = 5 * 106.4 = 532 units. Pipeline (413) is below the 5-period demand forecast (532), so OR should replenish to restore service level. Given the confirmed 4-period lead time and stable demand samples, I use default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level against holding cost using the prescribed base-stock formula; since pipeline is currently short of the 5-period demand, the OR engine will place an order up to its capped policy to reduce stockouts while respecting holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=413. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in earlier conclude messages). Recent visible demand history (provided samples) has mean = 106.4 units/period. Promised lead time is 4 so review+lead horizon = 1+L = 5 periods; default forecast over horizon = 5\xd7mean = 532 units. Pipeline (413) is below that 5-period expected demand, so the OR should replenish to cover the horizon. Profit=$4 / unit vs holding=$1 / unit \u2192 critical fractile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8, implying a bias toward higher service level. Given stable demand history and repeatedly confirmed 4-period actual lead time, I select defaults so the backend uses the established sample mean/variance and promised lead time to compute base_stock and cap. This balances avoiding stockouts (high q) while letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering policy to control order sizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 context: current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 417. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show arrived = orders with lead_time = 4 (confirmed repeatedly since Period 6), so actual lead time equals the promised 4. Recent demand history shows no sustained regime shift\u2014demand has fluctuated but remains around historical average. Given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1 the critical service quantile is high (q = 0.8), so the OR backend should target a relatively high base-stock. I therefore (1) set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4), giving the backend an empirically supported lead-time; (2) use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, because there is no strong evidence of a persistent demand mean/variance change and the large in-transit pipeline (417) already provides coverage. This balances service level (high q) against holding cost: default forecasts with L=4 let the OR engine compute the higher base-stock required for 5-period coverage while capping orders via its cap formula to limit excess ordering given the sizable pipeline.
