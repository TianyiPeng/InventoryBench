Rely on the in-transit 532 to cover the next ~5 periods based on recent average demand.

No sustained (>3 periods) upward or downward shift detected. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=4. An order of 532 was placed in Period 1 and currently shows as In-transit=532. Under promised L=4, that shipment would arrive during Period 5 (after this decision) and only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message read at Period 6. The absence of a conclude arrival in past periods is consistent with the promised 4-period lead time and is NOT evidence of loss.

Forecast next 5 periods demand (periods 5\u20139) using recent mean \u2248104 -> ~520 units.
