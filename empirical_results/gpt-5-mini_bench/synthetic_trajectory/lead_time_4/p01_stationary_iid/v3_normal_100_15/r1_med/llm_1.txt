Historical demands: P1=88, P2=133, P3=93, P4=108, P5=110 \u2192 mean = 532/5 = 106.4 units/period. No evidence yet of a sustained shift (only baseline sample available). c) Lead time & missing orders: supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals exist in history, so no confirmed deviation from promised lead time; in-transit=0 and on-hand=0. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: At decision time for Period 1 we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Because arrivals happen after the decision and promised lead time is 4, an order placed now will arrive during Period 5 (i.e., it will cover demand starting in Period 5 onward). To cover the current period plus the next L periods of demand reliably, the policy guidance is to ensure order + on-hand + in-transit covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we should order for five periods of expected demand. e) Final order logic: forecast = 106.4 units/period. Required coverage = 5 * 106.4 = 532 units. Given discrete units, place order for 532 units now. This balances lost-sales risk (starting inventory zero) against holding costs; there is no evidence to materially change the baseline forecast or to reduce order size.",

This indicates actual lead time >=1 but we do NOT have 3+ periods of evidence to reclassify lead time or mark shipments lost. Treat the 532 as pipeline inventory but remain cautious. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 532. Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods, so decision guidance says to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand with on-hand + in-transit + new order. Using a conservative short-term forecast of 118 units/period (recent mean), 5-period demand = 590 units. Current pipeline (0 + 532) covers ~532 of the required 590, leaving a deficit of ~58 units. e) Final order logic: Place enough additional units to bring pipeline up to cover 5 periods at the forecasted demand. Given uncertainty (possible lost/delayed shipments) and discretization, order a small buffer above the calculated shortfall. Therefore order 60 units now. This order will arrive after the supplier's lead time and will help cover demand if the in-transit shipment does not fully materialize on schedule.",
