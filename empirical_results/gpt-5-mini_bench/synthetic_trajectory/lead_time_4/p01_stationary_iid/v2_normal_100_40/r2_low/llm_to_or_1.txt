Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 4 periods; historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean \u2248 93 units/period (samples: 143,103,39,81,99) with moderate variance. Given no evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time deviation (no concluded arrivals to analyze) I use defaults so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility scaling. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the full review+lead demand (protects service level) while avoiding premature manual adjustments that could increase holding cost. I record no new carry-over insight.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_2. Demand context: historical sample mean = 93 units/period (samples: 143,103,39,81,99). Promised lead time = 4 periods; last decision (Period 1) placed 156 units which are currently in-transit and have not concluded yet (Period 1 conclude: ordered=156, arrived=0) \u2014 this is expected because arrivals for a Period 1 order with promised L=4 will occur during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message read at Period 6. I therefore do NOT treat the shipment as lost or late yet. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each) so q = 0.5 and z* = 0; the OR base_stock will reduce to mu_hat. To keep the OR engine aligned with the promised lead time and the full historical demand signal, I choose default methods: L = default (use promised lead time), mu_hat = default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples \u2192 (1+4)\xd793 = 465), sigma_hat = default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This ensures the backend targets the full (review+lead) demand (reducing stockout risk) while the backend's cap and z* calculations will temper order size given equal profit/holding. Given current pipeline (on-hand 0 + in-transit 156) is well below the default mu_hat, the OR engine will place replenishment to bring pipeline toward the target.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=317 (orders placed in Periods 1-2). Promised lead time=4. Historical demand samples (all available): [143,103,39,81,99], mean=93. There have been no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 and 2 conclude show arrived=0 for those orders). This is suggestive of delayed shipments but not yet a confirmed change in actual lead time (no concluded arrival data to compute an observed lead time). To avoid overfitting to possible transient delays, I use the default promised lead time and default demand aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock using (1+L)*mean of all samples. This keeps the forecast conservative (uses full sample mean across 5 periods) while the OR cap will limit order size if appropriate. If future conclude messages confirm longer or shorter lead time or a demand regime shift, I will switch to a calculated or recent_N method.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=347. Concluded history shows no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (arrived=0 each), but promised lead time is 4 periods so lack of arrival is not yet evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Demand sample history (all samples) has mean = 93.0 (samples: 143,103,39,81,99). Given no sustained, confirmable changepoint in demand or lead time and the large in-transit position, use the default/robust approach: keep L as promised (default) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples. This yields (1+L)*mean = 5 * 93 = 465 as the forecasted demand across review+lead period (backend will compute when using 'default'), and use the default volatility (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). Rationale: default methods respect the promised lead time until we observe concluded arrivals that prove a different actual lead time; using all-sample defaults balances service level (given profit=holding cost parity) while avoiding overreacting to apparent but unconfirmed delays. If future conclude messages show orders arriving earlier/later or lost, switch to a recent_N or explicit L and adjust mu_hat accordingly.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Observed on-hand=0, in-transit=354. Promised lead time is 4 periods and we have no concluded arrivals yet for recent orders (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 will only conclude after they arrive in the promised window and be visible in a future 'conclude' message). Historical demand samples provided for this SKU are Period_1..5 = [143,103,39,81,99]. There is no confirmed evidence (from concluded messages) of a change in actual lead time or a sustained demand regime shift, so I will use the environment defaults: trust the promised lead time and use the full-sample mean/variance scaling across the review+lead period. This keeps the OR backend using (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat, which balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). The large in-transit quantity (354) will be accounted for by the pipeline inventory when the backend computes the final order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_6. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-5 conclude) = [3, 17, 81, 95, 114], showing an overall rising trend with mean = 62 units/period. Inventory: on-hand=42, in-transit=212 (pipeline total=254) which is below the (1+L)-period demand expectation for L=4 (\u2248310 units using historical mean). Arrival history: an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 with observed lead_time=4; earlier orders showed no arrivals until that confirmed arrival. Given this clear observation I set lead time inference to use the observed data (calculate). Demand appears to be increasing recently but not yet a sustained multi-period regime (only two higher recent periods), so I will keep demand and volatility estimates based on the full sample (default) to avoid overfitting to short-term noise. Using L calculated from observed lead times (\u22484) and default mu/sigma lets the OR backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z\xb7\u03c3 and the capped order limit. This balances the need to replenish (pipeline 254 < expected 5-period demand \u2248310) while avoiding overreacting to a short recent uptick. Also, the confirmed lead time = 4 implies prior zero-arrivals were due to long lead time rather than permanent loss; therefore we rely on the observed lead time rather than the promised value alone.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-51.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 context: lead time was confirmed as 4 periods in Period 6 (order on P1 arrived in P5). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [143,103,39,81,99], mean=93 units/period. Current inventory: on-hand=127, in-transit=185, pipeline=312. Promised lead time is 4; with review+lead horizon = 5 periods, default forecast = 5 \xd7 mean = 465 units, so pipeline currently appears insufficient to cover the next (L+1) periods under the historical-average demand. No sustained change in demand regime or lead time beyond the confirmed lead time has been detected, so I use the backend defaults to let the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order. This balances service level (by using 5-period demand mean) against holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1), and leverages the confirmed lead time so the engine\u2019s pipeline calculation aligns with observed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: on-hand=80, in-transit=230. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [143, 103, 39, 81, 99] with mean = 93.0 units/period. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders on P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7), so I will use the observed lead-time signal rather than the promised default. With L set from observed data, use the default demand aggregation to let the OR engine compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This produces a base-stock that balances the 1:1 profit vs holding cost (q = 0.5) while accounting for the 5-period review+lead coverage (current period plus L periods). The existing in-transit (230) plus on-hand (80) provides substantial pipeline cover, so no explicit uplift or dampening is needed beyond using the observed lead time. No evidence of lost shipments beyond expected delays; use the calculate method for L to lock in the confirmed lead time and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8 all had lead_time=4). Demand has shifted up starting Period 5: recent demands (P5-P8 = 114,76,77,108) are materially higher than early periods. I treat lead time as the historically observed value by asking the backend to compute average observed lead times (method=calculate) so the OR engine uses confirmed information. For demand, I detect a sustained regime change beginning Period 5 (4 periods of higher demand). I therefore use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 4 samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices increase target inventory to satisfy the higher demand while the sigma update widens safety stock to reduce stockouts given lead time=4. Using recent_N prevents the old low-demand samples from biasing the forecast downward while still remaining conservative about variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 5: avg demand increased from 49.0 (Periods 1-4) to 93.75 (Periods 5-8), +91% (evidence: P5=114,P6=76,P7=77,P8=108).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=413. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9) confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 114,76,77,108,88) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs. Periods 1-4. I therefore (1) keep L at the promised/confirmed value to match observed arrivals and avoid mis-timing orders, and (2) forecast using the recent high-demand regime so the OR engine targets service for the current elevated demand. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the five-period post-change regime (avg demand \u2248 92.6, (1+L)=5 \u2192 implied mu_hat \u2248 463) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in this same window. This balances serviceability (avoiding stockouts given in-transit < expected 5-period demand) against holding cost by basing targets on the confirmed new mean and observed variability rather than diluting with older low-demand data.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: recent confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed in Period 6). Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown in environment plus later demands) indicate a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (previously recorded). Current on-hand = 9, in-transit = 329 \u2014 substantial pipeline covers many future periods given L=4. No shipments appear lost recently; arrivals have consistently matched a 4-period lead time. Given strong pipeline and confirmed lead time equal to the promised value, use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base-stock using full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (we have low on-hand now but large in-transit) while avoiding over-adjusting forecasts based on short-term variability. If future concluded periods show missing arrivals or a new demand shift, I will switch to recent_N or explicit methods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=333 (matches orders from Periods 8-11: 77+127+50+79=333). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (Period 5 showed P1->P5, and every subsequent concluded arrival aligns with 4); demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (carry-over noted). Recent demand (Periods 5-11) = [114,76,77,108,88,125,107], mean \u2248 99.29. Pipeline (333) will cover some upcoming demand arrivals but arrivals occur during Period 12 after my decision and are only observed next period. To ensure the OR backend targets the higher, sustained demand regime while respecting observed lead time, I (1) set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend explicitly uses measured lead time history; (2) set mu_hat using recent_N over the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 5-11, N=7) so (1+L)*mean reflects the sustained higher demand; (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=7 to capture the volatility in the new regime. This combination directs the OR engine to raise the base-stock to serve the confirmed higher demand while the sigma estimate hedges for variability. Using recent samples avoids dilution from the low-demand early periods and aligns ordering with the persistent post-Period-5 regime. I record no new carry-over insight here.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=387. Promised lead time=4 (previous conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4). Recent demand since the documented changepoint at Period 5 (Periods 5-12 = 8 samples) shows a higher regime: demands = [114,76,77,108,88,125,107,82], mean=97.125. With (1+L)=5 the (1+L)-period demand forecast \u2248 5 * 97.125 = 485.625, which exceeds current pipeline (387) so the OR engine should place an order. I choose L="default" to use the promised lead time (which matches observed lead time=4), mu_hat="recent_N" with N=8 to base the forecast on the confirmed higher-demand regime since Period 5, and sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=8 to capture volatility in that same regime. These choices keep the forecast focused on the sustained demand shift, helping the OR backend set a base-stock that balances the $1 profit versus $1 holding cost given the elevated demand and nonzero pipeline; using recent data avoids dilution by much lower pre-Period-5 demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 context: on-hand=27, in-transit=359. Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so actual lead time is confirmed as 4. Demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean) is sustained through latest data (Periods 5-13). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time rather than blindly trusting promise. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=9 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 5-13) so the base-stock reflects the higher realized demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=9 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples; using recent samples plus confirmed L helps the capped ordering cap and base-stock better balance service level (profit) against holding cost given the large in-transit quantity already present.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=411. Promised lead time=4 and prior concluded messages confirm actual lead time=4 (seen in Period 6). Demand regime shift occurred starting Period 5 (higher mean since P5); recent realized demands (P5\u2013P14) are the most relevant for forecasting. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded history supports it and the OR engine expects the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (covering Periods 5\u201314) to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime; this sets mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples so the base-stock reflects the elevated demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand data. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts) given high in-transit but zero on-hand, while avoiding overly conservative forecasts from very old low-demand samples.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Demand history through Period 15 shows an established higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (carry-over insight previously recorded). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=424 \u2014 pipeline is healthy but on-hand is zero going into this decision (demand in the current period will occur after this decision). Promised lead time is 4 and observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so I use the calculated/empirical lead time. For forecasting demand across the review+lead horizon I use recent data from the higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201315) rather than the full-sample mean to capture the sustained increase; regime length is 11 periods so I select recent_N with N=11. I apply the same recent_N window to sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend's base-stock reflects the sustained higher mean demand and recent variability while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding under-ordering from relying on older low-demand samples. The large in-transit (424) will be accounted for by the backend when it computes pipeline inventory; using recent_N prevents under-forecasting service needs during this sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in past conclude messages. Recent demand regime shift starting Period 5 is sustained (higher mean since P5). Current inventory: on-hand=31, in-transit=381 (pipeline+on-hand=412). Given the confirmed L=4 and the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent data (post-changepoint) so the OR engine forecasts reflect the higher mean and volatility. I choose L="default" (use promised 4), mu_hat="recent_N" with N=12 and sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=12 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and risk buffer on the last 12 periods (covers the confirmed higher-demand regime). This ensures the base-stock lifts to meet the new demand level while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures current variability; with large in-transit inventory (381) we are currently well-covered, so parameters aligned to the recent regime avoid systematic underordering once pipeline depletes.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: on-hand=69, in-transit=381. Promised lead time is 4 and past concluded messages consistently show actual lead time=4 (orders placed in P1..P13 arrived after 4 periods), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Historical carry-over noted a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (higher mean); however that insight is already recorded previously. Given current large pipeline (381) plus on-hand (69) = 450 units covering multiple future periods under the confirmed L=4, I choose conservative/default demand estimates so the OR backend uses its full-sample statistics to compute base stock. This avoids overfitting to recent noise while the pipeline clears; default sigma keeps variability measured across all history. These settings balance service (given strong pipeline) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute an appropriate base stock and cap, rather than forcing an explicit higher forecast which would increase holding costs now.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history (consistent arrivals from Orders placed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=94, in-transit=279. Recent demand regime (noted previously beginning Period 5) is persistent through Period 18, so I rely on recent-period demand to set forecast. I choose L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (matches confirmed L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=14 (regime from Period 5 through Period 18 \u2192 14 periods) so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the sustained higher-demand regime. This balances service (covering lead+review) against holding cost by tying base-stock to recent realized demand and variability rather than older low-demand samples. The large in-transit pipeline + on-hand will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing orders against the computed base-stock.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple observations). Current inventory: on-hand=92, in-transit=301 \u2014 ample pipeline. Demand regime shifted up at Period 5 and has persisted (Periods 5-19 show substantially higher mean than Periods 1-4). To align the OR backend with the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent data from the current regime when forecasting across the review+lead horizon. Choices: L set to promised/default (4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=15 (regime length from Period 5 through Period 19 = 15 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 15 demand samples. This focuses the base-stock on the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will temper order-up-to adjustments and avoid excess ordering given unit profit=holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Context: profit=$1/unit and holding=$1/unit imply q=0.5 so service tradeoff is balanced. Actual lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded messages (consistent arrivals every 4 periods), so I will use the promised/confirmed lead time. Inventory: on-hand=33, in-transit=306 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand (provides several periods of cover). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 5 onward (documented in carry-over) so I avoid using the long-ago low-demand samples. Decision logic: set L to default (promised 4, confirmed by concluded arrivals), but compute demand parameters from the recent demand regime to reflect the ~higher mean since Period 5. I choose recent_N with N=16 to capture the demand pattern from the regime start (Periods 5\u201320 is 16 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 16 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 16 samples. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity limits additional ordering, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (previously observed). Demand showed a sustained regime shift starting Period 5 (carry-over recorded). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-times (will be 4). For demand I focus on the post-shift regime (Periods 5\u201321, 17 samples): mean demand over P5\u2013P21 = 1650/17 = 97.06 units/period. With (1+L)=5 this implies a review+lead demand forecast \u2248 5 * 97.06 = 485.3 units; pipeline + on-hand = 346 + 86 = 432 units, so we are short roughly 53 units versus the (1+L) forecast \u2014 motivating replenishment. Using recent_N (N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat concentrates the optimizer on the new higher-demand regime and recent variability; this helps the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service (profit per unit = $1) against holding cost ($1/unit/period). Sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility in the same post-shift window so the safety stock matches current demand uncertainty. Using 'calculate' for L ensures lead-time estimate reflects observed behavior rather than the promised value if discrepancies emerge.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u201321) consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent Period 22 conclude had arrived=0 but prior evidence confirms 4-period lead time. Given lead time confirmation and sizable pipeline (400 units), use promised/default lead time so backend uses L=4. Demand history is variable but no new sustained regime change since the last confirmed shift (already recorded earlier), so use default demand aggregation: mu_hat default => (1+L) \xd7 mean of all samples. Use sigma_hat default for volatility ((1+L)\xd7std scaling). This choice lets the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances the 50%-ish critical fractile (profit=holding) implicitly; relying on default aggregate statistics is appropriate because we have confirmed lead time and no new 3+ period sustained demand change since the last recorded insight. The large in-transit quantity (400) should be sufficient to cover several review+lead periods, so aggressive explicit increases are unnecessary and could raise holding costs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=332. Profit= $1, Holding=$1 so critical to balance service vs holding. Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead times = 4 (many confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4), so use calculated average lead time to reflect empirical evidence. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (noted in carry-over); recent demand since that changepoint is the most relevant for replenishment. Therefore I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime (long enough to be stable but excluding very early low-demand periods). Using recent_N for both captures current mean demand over the last 19 periods of the higher-demand regime, which will raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand while sigma_hat recent_N scales variability similarly. This reduces stockouts under the higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand history. No new lost-shipment patterns or lead-time shifts detected beyond the confirmed lead_time=4.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 389. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (mean roughly doubled) and this regime has persisted through recent periods, so I bias forecasts to recent data rather than the long-ago low-demand samples. To capture the post-change demand level while respecting the lead time (1+L = 5 review+lead span), I ask the OR engine to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 20 observed demand periods (covers Periods 5\u201324), giving a stable recent-demand estimate and volatility for the base-stock calculation. This balances service (by sizing for the higher recent demand) against holding cost (by not over-weighting older low-demand samples). Using default L keeps alignment with confirmed lead-time observations and avoids forcing an explicit lead-time override.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual arrivals with lead_time=4 (many periods), so use the promised/default lead time. Demand has shown a sustained higher-regime since Period 5; to capture the recent, sustained demand pattern I use a recent_N estimator that weights the last 20 demand observations to form the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the current regime while avoiding overreaction to a single period spike. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and on-hand demand coverage) against holding cost by tailoring the base-stock to the current elevated demand pattern. On-hand (39) + in-transit (367) is healthy, but the recent_N choice prevents underordering if demand remains elevated and prevents excessive over-ordering by limiting the horizon to recent data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Context: profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so service level target q = 0.5; z* will be ~0. Demand has been at an elevated regime since Period 5 (carry-over insight). Current on-hand = 11, in-transit = 409 (total pipeline 420) which is large relative to typical period demand (~80\u2013130 recently). Many past orders have consistently concluded with lead_time = 4 (confirmed in history). No recently missing shipments: arrivals continue to show L=4, so promised lead time remains appropriate. Given the very large pipeline (409) I will avoid increasing forecasted demand (mu_hat) across the review+lead period; instead I rely on recent demand to reflect current consumption rate and recent volatility for safety. Therefore: set L to default (use promised 4). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the latest 8 periods of demand (focus on recent regime after Period 5). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to estimate recent variability; this keeps safety stock consistent with current variability rather than diluted by older low-demand samples. This approach prevents the OR engine from ordering more while a large pipeline is still inbound, and uses recent demand stats so base_stock reflects current consumption rather than long-run historical lows.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=469, promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand regime (noted previously starting Period 5) has been sustained through Period 27 with elevated mean versus earlier periods. Pipeline (469) currently covers multiple future periods of demand but visibility delay (arrivals only confirmed after arrival) means we should keep forecasts anchored to the sustained higher-demand regime. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (backend knows promised L=4 and observed confirms it). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime: using the most recent 20 demand observations gives the backend a forecast focused on the current higher demand level rather than diluting with the older low-demand periods. I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while relying on the large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering immediately; they help the OR backend trade off service (profit=holding cost) by basing base-stock on the current regime mean and variance.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=371. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many orders: e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ...), and there was a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_5 (higher mean from P5 onward). Pipeline (35 on-hand + 371 in-transit = 406) is ample versus typical recent demand, but a 4-period lead time requires ordering to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. I set L using 'calculate' so the OR engine uses the empirically observed lead time (averaging concluded lead times \u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-change higher-demand regime (regime length is long; cap at 20) so mu_hat reflects the most relevant recent mean multiplied by (1+L). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward the confirmed higher-demand regime while using realized lead time, balancing service level against holding cost given currently large pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Inventory: on-hand=59, in-transit=371. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed earlier). There was a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean sustained thereafter). Given the long, sustained higher-demand regime and many recent data points, I set lead time to the promised/default (4) and compute demand stats from the most recent regime to reflect the new normal. I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility from the last 20 demand observations, capturing the post-changepoint behavior. This keeps the base-stock responsive to elevated demand while capping orders via the backend cap to avoid excessive holdings. With profit = holding cost, the target service quantile is ~0.5, so aligning mu_hat to recent average demand (rather than the long-ago low-demand samples) reduces stockouts without incurring unnecessary holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Observations: on-hand=101, in-transit=369 (pipeline total=470). Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so I will keep L at the promised default. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained higher mean); to reflect the sustained shift and recent demand behavior I use recent_N estimates for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR engine on the latest demand regime. I choose N=20 to capture a long, sustained post-changepoint window (capped at 20) so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect current demand rather than the low initial periods. With large pipeline (470 units) we can tolerate ordering that targets service (higher mu_hat) while the OR backend's cap will limit excessive orders; using recent_N for sigma reduces over- or under-stocking caused by early low-variance samples. This balances profit-driven service level against holding cost given currently high inventory in transit.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. On-hand = 96, in-transit = 299. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time for all observed arrivals and a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (post-Period-4 mean roughly doubled). Pipeline (in-transit + on-hand = 395) is ample vs. a single-period demand but future arrivals follow confirmed 4-period cadence. I set L using calculated recent evidence of lead times to reflect the observed, sustained 4-period actual lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor forecasts on the post-change regime (large-sample recent window) so the OR backend builds base stock for the higher-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. Using recent_N for both demand mean and sigma aligns the (1+L)-period forecast with the confirmed higher-demand regime and gives the capped ordering rule realistic \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 inputs to balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Context: on-hand=49, in-transit=359. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P28\u2192P32), so actual lead time is stable. Demand regime: previous carry-over identified a sustained shift starting Period 5 (higher mean from Periods 5+), so I prioritize recent demand when forecasting. Pipeline (359) plus on-hand (49) is large relative to a single-period demand, so risk of stockout is low in the near term, but holding cost equals profit ($1 vs $1) so we should avoid excessive overstock. Decisions: set L using calculated observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; set mu_hat using recent_N to reflect the higher-demand regime and recent patterns (use N=20 to capture the latest behavior while smoothing noise); set sigma_hat using recent_N with same N to reflect recent volatility. This combination tells the OR engine to target a base stock based on the recent higher-demand regime while acknowledging steady lead time, which balances service level and holding cost given equal profit/holding (OR engine will translate profit/holding into z).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Context: lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods in prior concludes and no new evidence of delay or lost shipments in recent windows. Demand regime shift was previously detected starting Period 5 (higher mean); recent realized demands since that changepoint remain elevated. Current inventory: on-hand=95, in-transit=345 (total pipeline+on-hand=440). With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 so pipeline+on-hand covers ~440/ recent-period demand (~20-100+ per period) \u2014 sufficient short-term cushion but we must size base stock to the higher post-changepoint demand. Decision logic: keep L as default (use promised lead time = 4) because concludes confirm L=4 and no sustained deviation. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the sustained higher mean and recent variability; per changepoint rules I select N=20 (regime length >20 capped at 20) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 demands). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 so volatility is estimated from the same recent window. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost: using recent data raises the base-stock to serve elevated demand while sigma from the same window avoids underestimating variability. No overdue shipments require explicit lead-time adjustment now.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Current inventory: on-hand=74, in-transit=315 (pipeline total=389). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 for the vast majority of orders (e.g., many conclude messages with arrived units and lead_time=4), so I let L be inferred from observed lead times. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (carry-over insight already recorded), and we have a long recent history in that regime; to reflect the sustained higher demand I forecast using the most recent data. I choose L='calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the persistent 4-period behavior). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 periods (reflecting the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand samples). Using recent_N for mu_hat increases the base-stock to meet service given higher recent demand; using recent_N for sigma_hat raises safety stock to cover observed recent variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time and higher demand) against holding cost by restricting N to 20 (capping influence of very old samples) rather than using all history or an explicit large forecast.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P31\u2192P35 confirmations). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (previous carry-over insight). Current position: on-hand=31, in-transit=391 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=422 units. With promised lead time=4 and confirmed actual=4, the pipeline already contains many periods of coverage; however we must keep replenishment sized to the higher demand regime to avoid stockouts once pipeline depletes. I select L="calculate" to explicitly use the empirically observed lead time (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the most recent sustained regime (we have 31 periods since the regime shift at Period 5; cap N at 20). This balances service (capturing the higher recent mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory. No evidence of new lost shipments or further lead-time drift appears in the conclude history, so no explicit longer L or inflated safety is used. These settings guide the OR backend to compute a base-stock tuned to recent higher demand while the capped order size will moderate additional orders given the large pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: promised lead time = 4 and historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 (evidence in carry-over). Recent on-hand = 25 and in-transit = 348 \u2014 large pipeline relative to one-period demand. Historical demand evidence already flagged a regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean ~93.75 vs earlier ~49). Given the confirmed lead time and the established demand regime shift, I will use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base-stock using the full-sample demand statistics and the promised L=4 it expects. This keeps the decision consistent with observed steady lead time, leverages the backend's statistical pooling across all available samples, and avoids overfitting to short-term noise despite a high pipeline. Using defaults also avoids canceling or compounding pipeline inventory \u2014 important because we already have 348 units in transit which cover several lead periods. The chosen settings balance service (by using the full-sample mean which reflects the higher post-change demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. On-hand is 0 and pipeline (in-transit) = 344 units. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from many periods arrive after 4 periods), so there is no evidence of lost shipments or a lead-time change. Demand has been elevated compared with very early periods (a sustained regime shift was already recorded starting Period 5), but there is no new, sustained changepoint in the recent periods that would justify deviating from the default statistical estimates. Given profit = holding cost, the OR backend's base-stock formula balances service vs. inventory; using default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat lets the backend apply its full-sample estimates (which smooth over noise and respects the confirmed 4-period lead time). This also avoids overreacting to short-term demand swings while the large in-transit quantity is still outstanding.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=416. Promised lead time=4 and historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time=4. Recent long history shows elevated demand vs very early samples, but no new sustained changepoint since prior recorded shift (Period 5). Given current pipeline (416) provides roughly 83 units/period over the next 5 periods (416/5\u224883) and profit=holding cost, I choose the OR defaults so the backend will compute base_stock using the full-sample mean and full-sample std scaled by (1+L). Using defaults avoids over-reacting to short-term fluctuations and leverages the confirmed lead time; it balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* from profit/(profit+holding). If arrivals or demand show a new sustained shift, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast in future periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Historical data and conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (matches promised). Recent demand regime (documented earlier starting Period 5) is materially higher than early periods; to keep the base-stock responsive to the higher regime I use recent-history estimates rather than the full-sample average. Current inventory: on-hand=101, in-transit=375 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 476 units. With promised L=4, (L+1)=5 periods of demand must be covered by pipeline+on-hand; pipeline appears sizable so we avoid inflating mean unnecessarily from older low-demand samples. Choices: L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time (stable and observed). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the most recent 20 demand observations to compute (1+L)*mean). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility and ensure safety stock scales to current variability. These parameters signal the OR engine to target base stock appropriate to the elevated regime while the large existing pipeline reduces urgency to over-order; recent_N avoids dilution from the low-demand early periods and aligns service-level (profit vs holding) tradeoff with present demand and inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Situation: on-hand=0, in-transit=349. Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (confirmed in carry-over), so use promised lead time. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (carry-over: mean jumped ~+91% starting Period 5), so I place more weight on recent history rather than the full-sample mean. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while using N capped to 20 to balance recency vs. sample size. Using L=default (promised 4) ensures the OR engine computes (1+L) correctly; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat tells the OR engine to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples, which raises the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand. This approach also accounts for the large in-transit volume (349) when the backend subtracts pipeline_inventory; selecting recent statistics avoids underordering if demand remains elevated and avoids excessive holding by limiting N to 20 rather than the full history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=0, in-transit=427. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in earlier periods). Demand experienced a sustained regime increase starting Period 5 (recent long-run average ~94 units), so demand today is best represented by the full-sample mean which already reflects the higher regime. Given confirmed lead time=4 and the profit/holding parity ($1/$1) the backend's default base-stock inputs are appropriate: use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with observed steady higher-demand regime while letting the OR cap control order sizes against pipeline (we currently have large in-transit inventory = 427, so relying on the backend's capped order will avoid excess new orders).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals show orders placed Pt arrive P t+4). Recent demand regime increased starting Period 5 (carry-over insight): recent demand has been materially higher than early periods. Current inventory: on-hand=49, in-transit=356 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=405 units, which covers many upcoming periods at the elevated demand rate. Decision: keep L = promised lead time (default = 4) because concluded history consistently confirms L=4; no evidence of lost shipments now. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N window to capture the sustained regime since Period 5; per rules I pick N=20 (capped at 20) to reflect the recent high-demand regime and reduce influence of the low-demand early periods. Thus mu_hat uses recent_N, N=20 to produce (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 demand samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N, N=20 to estimate volatility over the same recent regime. These choices bias stocking toward the higher, sustained demand while the large in-transit quantity tempers immediate ordering, helping the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service level vs holding cost.

There is a demand regime shift recorded previously (higher mean since Period 5) and no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in recent concluded periods. Given the stable, confirmed lead time and the large pipeline, I choose the default methods so the OR engine uses the promised lead time (4) and full-sample demand statistics to compute base stock and caps. This avoids overreacting to single-period noise while letting the OR backend reduce orders because pipeline already covers multiple review+lead periods, balancing service level against holding cost.

Recent history shows the demand regime shift identified earlier (higher mean since Period 5). With a large in-transit pipeline (447) arriving over upcoming periods, I keep the backend assumptions aligned with the promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR engine can compute base-stock and cap using its historical estimates. I therefore select default lead time and default demand/volatility methods (use all historical samples) so ordering will primarily be driven by the sizable pipeline while the engine balances profit vs holding cost.

=== Period 45 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $76.00, Daily Holding Cost: $101.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. Context: confirmed lead time has been stable at 4 periods (carry-over). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_5; recent history (Periods 26-45) still shows substantial and variable demand. Current on-hand = 101 and in-transit = 316 (pipeline large relative to on-hand). To ensure the OR engine targets the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding understock given the 4-period lead time, I set L to the promised/default (4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained regime (capped at 20) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the latest 20 demands; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 to avoid stockouts across the 5-period coverage window) against holding cost by grounding estimates in the recent sustained high-demand regime and the confirmed lead time. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead times.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (earlier evidence) and demand regime shift (starting Period 5) already recorded in carry-over. Current on-hand = 53, in-transit = 364, total pipeline = 417. Historical sample mean (provided samples: 143,103,39,81,99) = 93 units; default (1+L)=5 \u2192 target mu_hat \u2248 465. Pipeline (417) is slightly below that target (465) so the OR engine should top up; using defaults keeps alignment with confirmed promised lead time and the backend's standard forecast formula. I choose default methods because lead time has been stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals in conclude messages) and the previously recorded demand regime shift is the only sustained change\u2014no new changepoint in recent periods. Using defaults lets the OR engine compute base stock and the capped order while accounting for the promised lead time and full sample statistics; this balances service (profit=holding cost) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent history shows actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed earlier), and a sustained demand regime shift was already recorded starting Period 5. Current on-hand = 57 and in-transit = 292 (large pipeline). To keep the OR engine aligned with the post-change demand regime I use recent data for demand moments while trusting the promised lead time. Therefore: L set to default (promised 4). mu_hat: use recent_N (N=20) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 20 demand observations so the base-stock reflects the current higher-demand regime and recent variability. sigma_hat: use recent_N (N=20) to compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the same recent 20 samples so safety stock matches recent volatility. This balances service (higher mean demand since Period 5) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline; using recent_N prevents legacy low-demand periods from biasing the forecast downward while keeping lead-time belief at the confirmed promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 408. Promised lead time = 4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand history (Periods 1-48) shows elevated and variable demand versus the very small initial sample; no new sustained changepoint since prior recorded insight. Given the confirmed lead time I let the OR engine compute an empirical L from observed lead times (calculate). I use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend will set mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This is conservative: it leverages the full sample set and the confirmed lead time to produce a base-stock that balances service level (profit=holding cost -> q = 0.5) and holding cost while accounting for pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 408 will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing order). I do not declare any new carry-over insights because there is no new, sustained (>3 periods) pattern beyond previously recorded shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many observations across history). On-hand = 8 and in-transit = 453 (total pipeline 461) \u2014 ample coverage versus typical demand, so no emergency replenishment needed. Demand exhibited a sustained regime shift starting Period 5 (noted in carry-over); recent demand has remained in the higher regime for many periods. To reflect the confirmed lead time evidence we let the backend compute the empirical average lead time (calculate). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach (N=20) to capture the current higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand periods; this keeps (1+L)\xd7mean focused on the recent, sustained demand pattern. For variability I also use recent_N (N=20) so safety stock scales to recent volatility rather than being dragged by early low-demand samples. These choices balance service level (capture higher recent mean and volatility) against holding cost (large existing pipeline reduces urgency to inflate orders). No explicit corrections for lost shipments are needed because arrivals have been consistently concluding at lead_time=4.
