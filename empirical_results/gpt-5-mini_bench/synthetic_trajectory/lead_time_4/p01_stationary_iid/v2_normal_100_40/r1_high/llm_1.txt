Average = 93 units/period. No clear sustained regime shift (values vary but no 3+ period consistent change). c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. There are no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred; assume promised lead time for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Because orders placed now will not arrive until Period 5 (N+4) and current period demand occurs after the decision, we must ensure our pipeline (order + on-hand + in-transit) covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand per the checklist. e) Final order logic: Use the historical average demand (93 units/period) as the forecast. To cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand, place an order of 93 * 5 = 465 units. This balances service readiness once arrivals occur while recognizing we cannot affect demand in Periods 1-4 due to the lead time. ",

The 5-period average demand = 465/5 = 93 units/period. c) Lead-time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. We placed an order of 465 in Period 1 which has not concluded yet (Period 1 conclude: ordered=465, arrived=0). This is consistent with a 4-period promised lead time (arrival would be during Period 5) \u2014 no evidence yet of a lead-time deviation or lost order. Only one conclude observed, so do NOT infer a change. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 465.

Expected demand over next 5 periods \u2248 5 \xd7 93 = 465 units. The in-transit quantity (465) therefore matches the expected 5-period demand, so the current pipeline is adequate. e) Order logic / final decision: Given high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1/period), over-ordering would yield profit but incur holding costs; however we already have enough units in transit to meet the forecasted L+1 demand window. There is no confirmed lead-time shortening or lost shipment to justify increasing the order now. Therefore place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and preserve profit margin. Monitor upcoming conclude messages to confirm arrival timing; if shipments are delayed or demand proves higher for several consecutive periods, adjust ordering later.",

Recent observed demands in conclude messages: Period_1 demand=38, Period_2 demand=103; these are consistent with the historical variance around the ~93 mean. No evidence of a sustained regime shift. c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. We see the order placed in Period_1 (465 units) still in-transit and not concluded by Period_2; this is expected when actual lead time >= 1.

Simple average over these 4 periods = 56 units/period. There is no sustained (3+ period) upward or downward shift evident; variability is high but no confirmed new regime.\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: There is an outstanding in-transit shipment of 465 units (ordered in Period 1) which has not yet concluded. Promised lead time is 4 periods, so that shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 (after the decision phase) and will therefore be available to satisfy Period 5 demand.

In-transit = 465 (expected to arrive during this period). Using the recent average demand (~56 units/period), the in-transit volume covers ~8+ periods of expected demand (465 / 56 \u2248 8.3). Given that lead time for a new order is 4 promised periods (new units would arrive much later) and current pipeline is ample, there is no operational need to place a replenishment this period.\ne) Final order logic: To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining service, place no order now. If the Period 5 conclude later shows the in-transit did not arrive (or actual arrivals are less than expected), we will reassess and order to restore coverage for L+1 periods.

Current In-transit = 280 matches orders placed in Periods 36-39 (140+50+70+20 = 280) and these will arrive during Period 40 (they are counted in the pipeline but will only be visible in Period 41 conclude). d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 54; On-hand + In-transit = 334.
