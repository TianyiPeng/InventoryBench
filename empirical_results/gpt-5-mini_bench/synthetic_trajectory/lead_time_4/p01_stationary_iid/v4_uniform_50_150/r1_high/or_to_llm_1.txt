Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, pipeline=469. Using historical mean demand = 93.8 units/period, (1+L)*mean = 5*93.8 = 469 expected demand over review+lead. Thus current pipeline already equals the expected demand over the L+1 horizon the OR policy targets. OR recommended 152 units; OR's base-stock logic aims to top up pipeline to a higher safety level, but since the pipeline already covers \u03bc\u0302, placing additional order would create extra holding cost without materially improving stockout risk given incoming arrivals. Final strategy: Order 0 units this period. Rationale: pipeline (469) covers the forecasted 5-period demand (469), so no additional order is necessary now; await the imminent arrivals (will be confirmed in Period 6 conclude) and then reassess.

Decision horizon and coverage: the decision rule asks to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, but because arrivals from a new order would occur after the game ends, new units will not help sales before Period 50.

Demand context: recent realized demand has softened (Periods 45\u201348 = 98,109,53,84) versus the earlier elevated regime; no new sustained shift (3+ periods) justifies increasing orders. Cost trade-off: profit per unit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), but placing orders now is pointless because they arrive too late.
