{
  "rationale": "Actual lead time is confirmed 4 periods. An order placed in Period 49 would arrive in Period 53 (after the 50-period horizon), so it cannot contribute to sales before the game ends. Current available pipeline (on-hand 235 + in-transit 97 = 332) is ample relative to recent demand (Periods 41-48 avg \u224892.5) and will cover remaining periods without new arrivals. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so placing any order that cannot be sold before the horizon only increases holding penalties.

{

Use (L+1)=5 period demand target: empirical single-period mean \u03bc\u0304=93.8 \u2192 5-period demand \u03bc\u0302=469. Pipeline 239 is ~230 units short of \u03bc\u0302. OR's capped policy (uses promised L and historical stats) recommends 155 units (close to its cap ~150). Given holding cost equals profit (critical fractile 0.5), the policy is risk-neutral between over/under; but we must materially refill to reduce expected stockouts over the next 5 periods because current pipeline is well below the 5-period demand. Ordering the OR recommendation (155) increases total pipeline to 394, reducing the shortfall from 230 to ~75 while respecting the OR cap rationale. Lost-shipment risk: recent history shows consistent 4-period arrivals, so no adjustment for losses. Final decision: follow OR recommendation of 155 units to materially close the gap toward the 5-period demand while avoiding excess above OR's cap that would raise holding costs.",
