You have 545 units in-transit from Period 1 order (concluded as arrived=0), which may still arrive in a future period or be delayed/lost; cannot infer loss yet. Inventory economics: profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1 per unit/period, so excess ending inventory directly erodes profit dollar-for-dollar. Given the large in-transit quantity (545) relative to recent demand (~114 per period), and the high holding cost equal to profit, placing additional orders now risks creating excess inventory and negative net reward if they arrive. Therefore do not place new orders this period; monitor arrivals in subsequent concludes to infer actual lead time or loss before ordering.",
