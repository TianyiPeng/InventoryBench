OR recommended 53 units using its capped base-stock; note profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile=0.5 (OR's policy implies indifference around expected demand). Decision: place 53 units (follow OR). Rationale for following OR: pipeline is already large (423) so adding modest order limits exposure to additional holding cost while roughly narrowing the expected coverage gap; ordering up to the full shortfall (~75) would increase ending inventory and holding costs with little expected marginal gain because profit equals holding cost.
