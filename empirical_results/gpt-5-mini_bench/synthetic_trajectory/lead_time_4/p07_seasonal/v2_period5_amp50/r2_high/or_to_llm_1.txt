Analysis: Pipeline (164) + OR order (163) -> total pipeline after our order = 327, which still falls well below expected 5-period demand (\u2248510) but OR\u2019s cap limits same-period order to \u2248163 to avoid excessive single-period swings. Risks: lead time may be long or orders may be lost (only one conclude with arrived=0 so cannot infer loss); holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so erring on higher inventory is acceptable but long promised lead time (4) means orders placed now won't help near-term demand. Decision: Follow OR's capped recommendation of 163 units\u2014this increases pipeline without overcommitting given limited info and unconfirmed lead-time. This keeps alignment with the data-driven safety cap while avoiding large deviations that might worsen exposure if shipments are lost or lead time shortens.
