Demand history (given samples) has single-period mean \u2248158, 5-period mean \u03bc\u0302=790. OR's capped base-stock implies ordering to bring pipeline toward ~853 but caps single-period ordering to ~213; however with pipeline=436 the uncapped order_raw would be negative, so no immediate replenishment is needed. Risk factors: holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4 favors avoiding excessive inventory; shipments may be delayed or lost (we already see no arrivals yet), so adding more in-transit units increases holding cost and exposure to lost shipments. Operational rule: ensure coverage but avoid overstock given uncertain arrivals. Decision: place 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary pipeline growth; monitor concluded arrivals in future periods and revisit ordering if arrivals fail or demand regime proves higher.

No conclude indicates lost shipments beyond those two, and current in-transit=567 is assumed deliverable under that lead time. Step 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Recent realized demand (Periods 4\u20138 = 127,134,125,148,126) averages ~132 units/period; using a 5-period horizon (L+1 = 5) gives expected demand \u2248 660 units. Step 3 \u2014 Pipeline cover: on-hand + in-transit = 0 + 567 = 567 units, so pipeline is ~93 units short of meeting 5 periods of expected demand (660). Step 4 \u2014 Safety buffer: allowing for variability and service (empirical std \u2248 9.6 over recent 5 periods \u2192 aggregate \u03c3\u0302\u224821.5 and z*\u22480.842 for profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) increases target pipeline to \u2248678 (\u2248111 short). Balancing the need to avoid stockouts vs. holding cost, I choose an intermediate increment to cover the clear shortfall while avoiding excessive overstock. Step 5 \u2014 Decision vs OR: OR recommends 167 (it uses different historical samples and promised L). Given our observed pipeline (567) and recent mean demand, ordering the full 167 would create larger-than-necessary holding cost; ordering nothing risks stockouts. I order 110 units to raise pipeline nearer the 5-period demand + modest safety without overshooting. This order + current in-transit (567) yields total future supply \u2248677, close to the 678 target from safety-adjusted projection. Action: order 110 units for Period 9.",
