Reality checks: on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so OR's capped 191 would leave a large shortfall relative to expected 5-period demand (655). Promised lead time is 4 periods; because arrivals happen after the decision and there is a 1-period observation lag, I must ensure pipeline+order+on-hand cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. There is no concluded arrival history to signal shorter lead time or lost shipments, so I must plan using the observed demand mean. Therefore I order 655 units to cover the expected 5-period demand (\u03bc\u0302). This overrides OR's capped recommendation because the cap would understock severely given current empty inventory and no in-transit stock.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 (earlier concluded P1\u2192P5 etc.), so an order placed in Period 49 would arrive in Period 53 (after the 50-period horizon) and therefore cannot affect remaining demand.

With only one decision period left and large pipeline, additional units would only incur holding cost and provide no sales benefit. OR recommended 0 units; I agree and place 0.
