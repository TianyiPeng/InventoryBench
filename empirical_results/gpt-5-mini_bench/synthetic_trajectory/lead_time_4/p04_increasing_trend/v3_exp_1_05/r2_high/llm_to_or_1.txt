Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time and population demand stats: choose L=default (promised 4). With no detected changepoint, set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (Periods 1\u20135). This balances service level given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) without overreacting to absent evidence.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=165 (ordered P1) but Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Promised lead time used. Historical sample mean=115.6 units; with promised L=4 the default mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=5*115.6=578 (backend computes). No sustained changepoint or lost-shipment confirmation; use default sigma to reflect historical variability. This keeps orders aligned with the OR engine's base-stock calculation while avoiding overreaction to an unconcluded in-transit shipment.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Promised lead time=4. Concluded history shows no arrivals yet for orders placed in P1\u2013P2 but only two conclude messages \u2014 insufficient to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Historical demand samples show moderate variability but no sustained regime shift. To avoid overreacting to limited conclude data, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; pipeline + default ordering will let the capped policy manage risk vs holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: observed concluded arrivals for Periods 1-3 are zero; in-transit=483 units. No concluded arrival messages yet for recent orders so actual lead time is unconfirmed\u2014use promised lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 = 103,81,107,127,160) show mean ~115.6. With promised L=4, expected demand over review+lead = (1+L)*mean \u2248 578 units, so current pipeline (483) is insufficient and the OR should order additional stock. I choose default methods so the backend uses full-sample mean/volatility and promised lead time, which balances service-level targeting per the OR formula while avoiding overfitting to limited recent noise given uncertain arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=638, recent concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4. Promised lead time is 4. Demand samples provided (Period_1..5) indicate elevated recent demand but not yet a sustained regime change. To let the OR engine use its default (promised) lead time and full-sample demand stats while accounting for pipeline inventory, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This avoids overreacting to unsettled arrivals while allowing the backend's capped base-stock policy to temper ordering given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4: concluded arrivals=0 while in-transit total=638 units (evidence of prolonged delays or potential lost shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1435.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision: observed Period_5 conclude shows arrival of 165 units (order from Period_1) with lead_time=4. On-hand=85, in-transit=506; several orders (from Periods 2-4) remain unconfirmed and may be delayed/lost. Demand history (Periods1-5): [103,81,107,127,160], mean=115.6. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead_time=4. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014conservative given limited evidence of a sustained demand regime change and outstanding missing shipments. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) while avoiding overreacting to a single high demand period or uncertain in-transit arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2614.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start. Recent demands: [103,81,107,127,160], mean=115.6. On-hand=103, in-transit=412; recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6). Some earlier prolonged delays resolved; remaining pipeline appears active. Use promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample stats to avoid overreacting to transient noise. Select L=default to use promised lead time (4), mu_hat=default to set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (stabilizes orders across the 5-period review+lead window), and sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit) against holding cost by not overly inflating safety stock based on short-term spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2180.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8. Recent realized demand (Periods 3-7 = 119,137,80,143,122; mean=120.2) shows no sustained regime shift but some variability. Observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=138 + in-transit=413 gives pipeline coverage; some earlier shipments were delayed but recent conclues confirm LT=4. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 periods (captures recent mean ~120) and reduce influence of older samples. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices give the OR engine a lead-time-aligned (L=4) review horizon and demand stats tuned to recent behavior, helping balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=196, in-transit=399. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived with 4-period lag); earlier prolonged delays resolved into consistent 4-period arrivals. Demand samples available (Period_1\u2013Period_5: 103,81,107,127,160) and subsequent realized demands (Periods 5\u20138: 80,143,122,97) show no sustained downward regime\u2014use full-sample default forecasts. I select L=default to keep promised 4-period lead time (confirmed by concludes) so pipeline accounting aligns with arrivals; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while preserving safety against any lingering lost shipments.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=80, in-transit=434. Historical demand samples (periods 1-5): [103,81,107,127,160] mean=115.6. Past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods for earlier orders and no new sustained lead-time anomalies since. Some earlier prolonged delays were observed but recent concludes (P5-P9) show consistent 4-period arrivals. I therefore use the promised/default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier performance. For demand forecast I use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to smooth limited data and avoid overreacting to short-term spikes; sigma_hat uses the default population-scaled std to reflect observed variability over the (1+L) horizon. This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) by targeting the backend's base-stock while avoiding excessive stock given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11. On-hand=0, in-transit=526 (some prior long delays observed but recent concludes confirm lead time=4). Historical demand samples (periods 1-5) mean=115.6 units; no clear sustained demand regime change. I choose L=default to use the promised (and recently confirmed) 4-period lead time, mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean using all samples, and sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps forecasting conservative given confirmed lead time and limited evidence of a new demand regime while avoiding overreaction to in-transit irregularities.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11). On-hand=13, in-transit=538 (large pipeline from prior orders; earlier missing arrivals were resolved and lead time confirmed). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead time average (captures confirmed 4-period reality). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all available demand samples scaled by (1+L) for a stable forecast\u2014this balances service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost given abundant pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2926.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent demand has risen and been volatile since Period_5 (e.g., Periods 5-12 demands: 80,143,122,97,149,182,145,177). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=0 and in-transit=568 units (covers part of upcoming demand but some earlier shipments were delayed/lost historically). I choose L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N (last 8 periods, Periods 5-12) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean and volatility; same recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect current variability. These settings make the backend target a base stock sized to recent higher demand while reflecting observed lead time, improving service vs. holding tradeoff given profit>>holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14. On-hand=0, in-transit=696; historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P9 show 4). Demand history shows no sustained new regime that meets 3+ period threshold, so use full-sample forecast. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to short blips or delayed shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been confirmed at 4 in prior periods. I set L to default (use promised 4). To capture the recent higher demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 concluded demand samples to scale (1+L) forecast and volatility; this raises target base-stock to better cover near-term demand while keeping estimated variability grounded in recent data.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent demand context uses samples (Period_1-5 mean=115.6) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=656 \u2014 pipeline is large and recent conclude messages show consistent 4-period arrivals, so use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR engine compute base stock while accounting for 4-period pipeline. This avoids overreacting to earlier transient missing-arrival signals now resolved.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=651; recent demand has risen and become more volatile (Periods 12-16 demands: 177,177,216,187,217). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. To respond to the sustained demand uptick, I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 5 periods so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility while keeping L at the promised/default (4). This increases target pipeline to reduce stockouts given long lead time while the OR backend caps orders using its cap formula.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18. Recent demand (periods 1\u20135 samples: 103,81,107,127,160) shows moderate upward trend; concluded history (Periods 5\u201317) consistently indicates actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=0 with in-transit=684 (coverage for upcoming periods). Because lead time has been stable and arrivals now consistent, I use defaults so the OR engine leverages all historical samples and promised lead time to compute base_stock and caps, avoiding overreaction to short-term variability while covering (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=800. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed). Recent demand has been high and volatile (recent concluded demands: P14\u2013P18 = 216,187,217,198,245) so we preserve the promised lead time and let the OR engine compute demand across review+lead using all samples. Using default methods keeps the backend's statistical aggregation (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std so the capped ordering rule balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline. No new evidence of additional lead-time change or sustained regime shift beyond prior confirmed LT=4.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20. Recent demand has trended high (latest concluded demands: periods 11\u201319 show several large spikes, e.g., 301 in P19). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 685; past prolonged delays were observed but lead time has since been confirmed as 4 periods. I select L=calculate to lock in the observed lead time average (evidence: many concluded arrivals showing 4-period lag). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses all available demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed L and avoids overreacting to recent spikes without a sustained regime change.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=764. Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and prolonged earlier delays but arrivals since Period_5 match promised 4-period lead time. Demand sample set (provided) has mean = 115.6 (periods 1-5). Using default methods keeps L at promised lead time and sets mu_hat/sigma_hat from full-sample statistics so the OR backend will target (1+L)-period cover while respecting the cap; this balances service level given large pipeline and avoids overreacting to transient delays.

Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=792. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 periods; recent demand has risen sharply from Period_14 onward (periods 14\u201321 show much higher demand vs earlier). To capture the new high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=8, periods 15\u201322 window) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the elevated mean and higher variability, improving service level while still limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=935. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1..P18 arrived after 4 periods), so use observed lead-time estimate. Demand has risen materially after Period 9 with recent periods (P14\u2013P22) showing much higher demand (range ~159\u2013307, recent mean elevated). To capture the recent high-demand regime while limiting noise, I use a recent_N approach with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on most recent 10 demand samples). L set to calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time average. These choices raise the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to reduce stockouts given large in-transit but long lead time, balancing higher service level vs holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from Period t arrive in Period t+4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1155 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals will only be visible next period. Historical sample demand (periods 1\u20135) mean=115.6; no sustained new demand regime detected (insufficient sustained changepoint evidence), so use default demand/volatility settings. Choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, keeping the OR engine forecast anchored to the full-sample prior; sigma_hat=default to let the backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This approach avoids overreacting to short-term pipeline fluctuations and balances service level vs. holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25. Recent demand has risen and stabilized at a high level (Periods 20-24 demands: 296,307,283,342,308; recent avg \u2248307). On-hand=0, in-transit=910 which with L=4 covers ~5 periods (~910/5\u2248182 units/period) \u2014 below recent demand (~307/period), so we must replenish to meet elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L.

To be conservative and consistent with observed lead time, use default promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples: L=default ensures OR uses the promised/observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to size the replenishment over review+lead period; sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to reflect aggregate variability. This balances service level (meeting multi-period demand given long lead time) against holding cost by relying on the standard baseline estimates.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_27: lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; recent demand has risen materially (Periods 22-26 avg \u2248330 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=904 units (covers ~2.7 future periods at recent demand) which is below required (L+1)=5 periods coverage. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to promised (default) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand observations so the OR backend targets a base stock sized for the new higher mean and volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=966. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed with W=4). Demand has trended up materially over many periods (recent demands >> early samples); to capture the current higher demand regime I use recent data for demand mean/volatility while using calculated lead time from observed concludes. This balances service (protect against stockouts given rising demand) and holding cost (uses recent std to avoid overstocking). In-transit (966) should cover several upcoming periods but pipeline must be considered by OR engine when computing final order.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: demand has been high recently (most conclude messages show large demands; Period_28 demand=380 with no arrivals visible yet). On-hand=0, in-transit=1359 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely includes recent large orders; Period_28 conclude shows ordered=393 arrived=0 which is consistent with 4-period lead time pattern (arrivals observed historically at lag 4). Given sustained evidence of lead_time=4 in concluded history and no new multi-period loss signal, use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast that balances service level vs holding cost while letting the OR engine account for variability and profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=1031. Historical conclues show actual lead time=4 and recent demand has risen and stabilized near ~373 units (Periods 25-29: 346,372,394,380,374). Many earlier periods showed much lower demand; use recent data to capture current regime. L set to promised (default=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to reflect the sustained higher demand over the last 5 periods and to size the (1+L)-period forecast accordingly; this also mitigates risk from earlier low-demand samples.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: recent history shows sustained high and rising demand with confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1199 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are observed only after decisions (1-period observation delay). Given consistent 4-period lead times and no clear recent demand regime break, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This balances service (profit>>holding cost) while avoiding aggressive manual up-forecasting despite a sizeable in-transit pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=1081. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many P concludes indicate 4). There were earlier missing arrivals but subsequent concludes confirm shipments and LT=4. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Demand samples provided (periods 1\u20135) are limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasting conservative given limited explicit recent-sample evidence. This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) with holding cost by letting OR engine compute safety stock from observed variance.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=1094. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many orders concluded with W=4). Demand has been substantially higher in later periods vs. early samples (sustained high regime across recent periods), so I bias the forecast to recent data. Set L to promised lead time to align with concluded evidence. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime using a sufficiently long recent window (N=20) to smooth noise while reflecting the new regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock from recent demand statistics.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34. Recent conclude history confirms actual lead time = 4 and there are no new sustained changepoints in demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=1554 (plenty pipeline but arrivals are seen with 1-period observation delay). To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and historical demand stats (the provided seed samples), I use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes base-stock from (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids overfitting to transient fluctuations and lets the OR cap/order logic manage pipeline sizing given the long lead time and holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7638.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 4 consistently and recent demand has shifted up markedly since Period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=1264 (covers multiple future periods). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). Demand forecast uses the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201334) so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=16 to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean on the current regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=16 to capture volatility in the same regime. These choices prioritize service (meet much higher demand) while using pipeline to avoid excessive extra ordering given substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg demand P1\u2013P18 = 155.83, avg demand P19\u2013P34 = 387.63 (+148.8%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $5130.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Demand regime since Period 19 is materially higher (avg ~387.6) so forecast should use the post-shift regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=1527 which covers ~3.9 periods at the higher demand; with promised lead time 4 we need (1+L)=5 periods coverage. Therefore use L=default (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-shift regime (N=16) so the OR backend targets the higher mean/volatility and replenishes to cover the 5-period window despite delayed arrivals.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Recent sustained demand regime higher since Period 19 (documented earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=1672 \u2014 pipeline is large but several past orders indicate 4-period actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default=4). For demand I target the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N on last 18 periods (Periods 19\u201336) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility; N=18 is regime length (>=3 and <=20). This balances service level (capture elevated demand) while letting OR cap limit orders to avoid excess holding given high in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=1761. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_19 (elevated demand through Period_37). I set L=default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm 4. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=19) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Period_19\u2013Period_37) so the backend raises base-stock to meet the new demand level while still accounting for variability; this balances high profit ($19) vs modest holding cost ($1).

Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=2242. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (higher mean ~387.6). In-transit covers multiple future periods but demand is in the higher regime; to align the OR engine with the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N estimates based on the post-changepoint samples. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 19\u201338) so the backend sizes base stock and caps for the current high-demand environment while avoiding understocking from stale low-demand data.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=2030. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P arrivals match ordered on P-4). Demand regime shifted up around Period 19 and recent demand is much higher (periods 19\u201339). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time average (4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the high-demand regime (cap at 20 most recent samples). This biases the OR base-stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the OR backend will apply its service-level cap; using recent statistics reduces stockouts given current in-transit but zero on-hand.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=2130. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 consistently. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 19; thus I focus forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent regime (P21\u2013P40 approximate 20 most recent samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the latest high-demand observations. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period_19 (sustained higher demand since P19). On-hand=0, in-transit=2247 (pipeline large). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods). To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N over the post-P19 regime (use max 20 samples per rule) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the higher mean/volatility; keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals confirm it. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand statistics rather than long-ago low-demand data.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_43. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained high-demand regime since Period_19 (avg increased ~+149%). On-hand=0, in-transit=2353 \u2014 pipeline substantial but arrivals will only be visible next period. To align OR with the sustained higher demand, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules). This raises base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=2735. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders ordered on Period t arrived on Period t+4). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift around Period_19 (higher mean thereafter). To reflect confirmed lead time and the higher recent demand regime, set L using observed lead times and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime data. I choose L='calculate' (average observed lead times \u22484). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (captures latest demand regime while capping N per rules). This increases the base stock to protect against stockouts given large in-transit but long lead time, while sigma from recent variability informs safety stock and the OR cap will limit excessive orders.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45. On-hand=0, in-transit=2546 units. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (stable). In-transit inventory is large relative to recent sample mean, so use promised lead time and default demand estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute base stock while avoiding over-adjustment for noise or past delays. No evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time regime since prior insights.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_46: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_19 (carry-over shows +148.8% increase). On-hand=0, in-transit=1864 (many outstanding shipments but recent concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4). I set L to promised (default) because concluded history repeatedly shows 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use most recent 20 periods to forecast (1+L)-period demand). Sigma uses recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while recognizing confirmed 4-period lead time and outstanding pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=2024. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; use default promised L to match observed system. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 19 (sustained); to capture current mean/volatility use recent_N with N=20 (max cap) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 20 observations. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline (2024) provides cover for the next (1+L)=5 periods reducing urgent ordering risk.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 19 (carry-over insight). I set L via calculate to use confirmed observed lead times (avg \u22484). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the base-stock target aligned with the sustained higher demand while avoiding dilution from older low-demand data and acknowledge confirmed lead time so pipeline coverage is correct.

LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=2717. Historical concluded arrivals show stable actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 19 (carry-over). Given the long-running higher-demand regime, I set L to promised (default=4) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime data. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for current high-demand volatility while capping order size via its internal cap. This reconciles large pipeline (2717) with continued high demand and avoids underforecasting service needs.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 context: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_19 (carry-over evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=3714 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. There were earlier missing arrivals (Periods 1\u20134) but lead time has since been confirmed as 4. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (4) which matches observed concluded lead times. Demand estimate: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the post-Period_19 high-demand regime (regime length \u226520); this focuses the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most relevant recent data. Volatility: use recent_N with N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability in the high regime. These choices keep the OR engine\u2019s base-stock focused on the confirmed higher-demand regime while using the promised lead time; with large in-transit inventory, this avoids over-ordering from stale long-term averages and balances service vs holding cost.
