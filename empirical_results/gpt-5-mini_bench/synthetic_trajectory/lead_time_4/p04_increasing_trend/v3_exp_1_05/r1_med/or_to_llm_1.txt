Step 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=165 (from P1). Observed demand in P1 was 118, slightly above historical sample mean (~115). With promised L=4, coverage target is (L+1)=5 periods of demand; OR's capped base-stock (160) reflects that horizon and the profit/holding tradeoff (q=4/5). Step 3 \u2014 OR recommendation assessment: OR =160 uses historical mean and cap; it ignores the single higher recent demand and cannot see possible in-transit uncertainties. We are cautious because in-transit 165 may cover future demand if it arrives; ordering much more risks holding cost if shipment arrives as promised.
