Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples available (107,252,298,376,544) show a rising trend but only 5 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Promised lead time is 4 and no evidence to override it. Use default lead time so backend applies promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, capturing the available historical demand while keeping decisions simple given no confirmed regime change or delayed shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Visible info: on-hand=0, in-transit=581; Period_1 conclude shows ordered=581 arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet\u2014cannot infer actual lead time (promised L=4). Recent demand in Period_1 was 146 (conclude) and historical samples show rising demand trend, but only one concluded new demand point so not yet a sustained regime change. Use default lead time to rely on promised L and let OR backend apply historical statistics. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5). This keeps orders conservative while pipeline (581) is expected to cover upcoming periods if it arrives.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=1131 (orders from P1+P2), no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed. Demand history available. Promised lead time used because there is insufficient concluded evidence of a different lead time or lost shipments. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=1350. Historical demand samples (given): mean=315.4 units/period (Periods 1-5). Promised lead time=4. There are concluded messages showing 0 arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3, but given promised L=4 these orders would not be expected to conclude yet (orders placed P1 arrive visible at P5 conclude). No confirmed lead-time change. Pipeline (1350) covers ~4.28 periods at historic mean (1350/315.4) but (1+L)=5 period coverage target is ~1577 units, so pipeline is short of the default target. To avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays and because no sustained changepoint in demand is evident, use default demand/volatility and default lead time so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std calculations. This balances service level vs holding cost while allowing the OR engine cap to limit excessive orders given current pipeline.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision: demand has been trending up (samples: 107,252,298,376,544). On-hand=0, in-transit=1411 (undelivered orders exist). Orders from Periods 1\u20134 concluded with arrived=0, indicating prolonged delays or lost shipments. I will use the backend defaults so OR engine assumes promised lead time and uses full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This keeps the backend's demand estimate broad (captures rising demand) while the defaults avoid overreacting to the unresolved arrival pattern; I will record the delayed-shipment signal for future adjustments if arrivals remain missing.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not arrived by their conclude messages (arrived=0 for P1\u2013P4), suggesting prolonged delays or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: observed confirmed arrival from Period 1 in Period 5 indicates actual lead time = 4. On-hand=74, in-transit=910 \u2014 pipeline substantial but past conclude delays occurred. I choose L by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time data (backend will average observed lead times). Demand shows a rising regime across the last 5 samples, so I set mu_hat via 'recent_N' with N=5 to weight the most recent regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Volatility I'll leave to the backend 'default' to reflect overall sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices target service (higher mu_hat from recent samples) while relying on backend caps to limit over-ordering given holding cost; using calculated L acknowledges confirmed lead time and prevents under-ordering due to earlier delayed concludes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand has trended up (samples P1\u2013P5 = 107,252,298,376,544; mean=315.4) and two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=932 (pipeline present but arrivals are observed with 1-period observation lag). I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to capture the confirmed L=4 (method: calculate). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to provide a stable forecast that reflects the overall upward trend while letting the OR engine apply the analytical service-level cap. This balances service (use confirmed lead time and full-sample mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=1345 (orders from P4\u2013P7). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand has increased recently (last 3 periods 298,376,544). To capture the confirmed lead time and recent demand surge, set L by calculating observed lead times, use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to weight the higher recent mean across (1+L) periods, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for elevated demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period_3: last-3-period avg demand=406 vs earlier 2-period avg=179 (+127%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=1986 (orders placed P5\u2013P8 will arrive during Period 9 but not yet visible). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods). Demand has shifted higher since Period_3; recent high demands (Periods 4\u20138 = 426,507,636,618,775) motivate using the recent regime for forecasts. I set L by calculation to reflect confirmed lead time=4. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 periods (captures current high-demand regime). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture volatility in the same recent window. This raises target base stock to cover 5 periods of elevated demand while using pipeline inventory to avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_10. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: Periods 7\u20139 demands = {618,775,831}, recent-3 avg \u2248 740.7 vs earlier periods much lower. On-hand=0, in-transit=2718 (pipeline large). Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived orders had lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). To capture the confirmed lead time while biasing the forecast toward the new higher-demand regime, set L by calculating the observed average lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the demand surge. This balances service (higher base stock to meet elevated demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=3069. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P6 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand has stepped up: last 3 demands = 775, 831, 993 (avg=866.33) vs earlier periods much lower. To cover the higher recent demand across the review+lead horizon and because lead time is confirmed 4, I use a recent_N forecast (N=3) so mu_hat reflects the elevated regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N to capture recent volatility. L is set to calculate so the backend uses observed lead times rather than blind promise. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given big recent demands) against holding cost by relying on a short N=3 recent estimate rather than full-sample dilution.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: recent history shows a persistent high-demand regime starting Period_3 (sustained higher demand through Period_11) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=3490 (pipeline large). I set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 3\u201311 constitute the new regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid dilution by the much lower earlier periods. This biases orders toward meeting the higher demand while the OR backend caps orders using its cap; large pipeline reduces immediate additional ordering pressure.

Period_13: On-hand=0, in-transit=2793. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from P1..P8 arrived after 4 periods). Demand has accelerated sharply and persistently since Period_3 and especially the last six periods (P7\u2013P12). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (focus on most recent 6 periods P7\u2013P12). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the OR backend will cap orders per its safety rule to limit excess holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=3337. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (consistent arrivals for orders placed P1\u2013P9). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_3; recent periods (P9\u2013P13 demands = 831, 993, 1136, 1302, 1175) average ~1087.6. To capture the sustained higher demand and limit stockouts while avoiding excess holding, I set L to the calculated average observed lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the new regime.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=3799. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders repeatedly arrived after 4 periods). Demand has shifted up substantially in recent periods (Periods 10\u201314 average demand ~1,225). To capture the confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' for L (backend will infer average observed lead time = 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 10\u201314), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will temper ordering by the capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1053.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent demand has jumped and stayed high since Period_9. On-hand=0, in-transit=4218 (covers some future demand but arrivals only visible next period). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in conclude messages, so keep promised lead time. To capture the new sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 9\u201315, 7 samples) so the OR engine sizes orders to meet the elevated demand while accounting for observed variability. This balances service (reduce stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to the current high regime. L uses default (promised lead time=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_9: avg demand Period_9\u201315 = 1184 (7 periods) vs prior post-shift avg \u2248406 (+192%)

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=5763. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P12 arrived after 4 periods), and demand has experienced a sustained upward regime since Period_9 (Period_9\u201315 avg \u22481184). To reflect confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' so backend sets L=4 from observed lead times. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime P9\u2013P15 length=7). Likewise, demand volatility should reflect the same recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=7. These choices ensure the OR engine targets inventory to cover the current high-demand regime over the review+lead horizon while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given prior delayed arrivals.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. On-hand=0, in-transit=5099. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P13 arrived after 4 periods), so use calculated lead time. Demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime starting at Period 9 (avg Period_9\u201315 \u22481184); recent realized demand is high but volatile due to stockouts. I select L via "calculate" to reflect observed lead time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 (covering Period_9\u2013Period_17) so mu_hat reflects the new high-demand regime while including several recent periods despite stockouts. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=9 to capture post-shift volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit overstock risk given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=4979. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 9 (elevated means through Period 18). To ensure pipeline covers the (1+L) review+lead window and reflect the post-shift demand level, use the promised/default lead time and compute demand estimates from the most recent regime. I select recent_N with N=10 (covering Periods 9\u201318) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the updated high mean and volatility over the sustained high-demand window, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20: recent demand is in the elevated regime established at Period_9 (higher mean ~1184). On-hand=0, in-transit=5186 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals occur with 4-period lead). Observed lead times in conclude history are consistently 4 periods. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period_9\u2013Period_19. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward higher coverage for the confirmed higher-demand regime while using observed lead time to align orders with arrivals and avoid understocking.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21: demand has been in the high regime since Period 9 (recent periods showing ~1.4k\u20132.0k demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=5299. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4, so use default lead time. Use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat: I choose recent_N with N=7 (Periods 14\u201320) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (mean \u22481666 units/period), then scale by (1+L)=5 to cover review+lead. This addresses missing earlier shipments by relying on confirmed LT and recent high-demand samples so the OR engine will target a higher base stock and reduce stockouts while balancing holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 9 with large realized demand and confirmed actual lead time = 4. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 6646 (covers several future periods). I keep L as default (promised=4, confirmed by past concludes). For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime (use last 13 periods since the regime from Period 9\u201321 is 13 periods long). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=13 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime; this raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while the large pipeline reduces excessive ordering.

Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period_9 (carry-over insight). I set L to be inferred from observations (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 9\u201322) to capture the sustained high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR base-stock targets the current high-demand regime and uses pipeline to cover (L+1) periods while avoiding understock given long lead times and recent high variance.

On-hand=0, in-transit=5998 (covers several periods but arrivals will be visible with one-period delay). Set L by calculated recent evidence of lead time=4. For demand I target the recent high regime: use recent_N with N=7 (captures Periods 17\u201323) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses the same 7 recent samples to reflect current volatility. This balances service level (high recent demand) against holding cost by sizing base stock to the confirmed high-demand regime rather than long-ago low demands.

On-hand=0, in-transit=6718 (covers some future demand but arrivals visible only next period). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in conclude messages. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (recent regime from Period 9\u201324, 16 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and avoid diluting forecast with much lower pre-shift samples; this gives the OR engine a demand estimate covering (1+L) periods aligned to current demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Demand has experienced sustained upward regime shifts earlier (noted in carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=6144 (sizable pipeline arriving per observed 4-period lead times). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4, so using promised/default lead time avoids overfitting to transient noise. I select default methods so the OR backend computes base-stock using (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this leverages full history while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and the large in-transit volume. This balances service level (captures higher recent demand via historical mean) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 9 (much larger than early-period demands). On-hand=0, in-transit=5396 which should cover multiple upcoming periods but arrivals are observed with a 1-period reporting delay. Promised lead time (4) has been repeatedly confirmed by concluded messages; I therefore keep the default lead time. To align the OR forecast with the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 7 demand observations to capture the current level and volatility without over-weighting older low-demand samples. This increases provisioning for service while avoiding excessive long-term holding (holding cost = profit so we balance service and inventory).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=6453. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed in P1\u2013P27 that concluded arrived with W=4). Demand has risen since early periods (carry-over notes) but no new sustained changepoint since prior records. Given confirmed lead time=4 and large pipeline coverage, use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this keeps parameters consistent with observed lead time and lets the backend cap orders given current large in-transit inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand is in a sustained high regime since Period_9 (much larger than early periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=4070 (pipeline substantial). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 9\u201328), giving (1+L)*mean over the most recent 20 samples so the backend targets service for current demand levels. Sigma also uses recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same window. These choices ensure pipeline + orders cover the (1+L) horizon given high recent demand while avoiding overstating demand from very early low periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=5404. Concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time = 4 (many orders: lead_time=4). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_9; to capture current demand level I use recent_N over the most recent 20 periods (captures Period_10\u2013Period_29 demand behavior and avoids diluting with early low-demand periods). L set to calculate to lock in observed lead-time=4. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=20 so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap to meet the elevated demand while limiting overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 16 (very large demands; last 15 periods elevated). On-hand=0, in-transit=8314 (large pipeline). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. I set L=default (promised 4). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most recent 15 samples, which balances service for the elevated demand while relying on observed volatility; this works with the large in-transit pipeline to avoid underordering given persistent high demand and confirmed lead times.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_9 (historic concludes show demands mostly >1000 and recent periods ~2500\u20133152). On-hand=0, in-transit=8757 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed by lead time; observed lead time confirmations are consistently 4 periods. To keep the OR engine responsive to the elevated demand, I use a recent-window forecast (captures current high regime) and recent-window volatility. I keep L as default (promised = 4, confirmed by concluded messages). Recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7) uses the most recent 7 demand samples to reflect the current high-demand regime and limit overweighting older low-demand periods; this balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent demands: P28\u2013P32 = 2890,2959,3004,3152,3151). On-hand=0, in-transit=12012 which must cover review+lead demand. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from concluded arrivals (historically 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (use mean of last 5 samples scaled by 1+L). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices focus the OR backend on the recent high-demand pattern while letting the backend compute lead-time and scaled mu/sigma so orders plus pipeline meet (1+L) periods of demand without excessive extra holding given symmetric profit/holding costs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=12357. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders that arrived have W=4). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_9 (sustained higher mean). To capture the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking, keep L at promised/default (4) and set demand estimates using recent data. I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (long enough window to smooth variability but focused on post-shift behavior). This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N expands safety stock for variability; together they help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume and prior lost arrivals.

Period 35. On-hand=0, in-transit=9447 \u2014 large pipeline available; recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods. Demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (sustained elevated demand since Period 9). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (matches observed 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 7 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), which raises target base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts given the large pipeline and high demand while balancing holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded orders with lead_time=4) and large elevated demand since Period 9 (sustained high regime). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 9836 \u2014 pipeline large but demand is high so we must forecast over the review+lead period using the most recent high-demand regime. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed average lead time (evidence: numerous concluded orders with lead_time=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Period 9 onward; regime length >20) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean over (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) given high current demand while relying on many recent observations to avoid overreacting to single-period spikes.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 32\u201336) is markedly higher (~3.1\u20133.6k per period). I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (confirming L=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 32\u201336), so the OR engine builds a base-stock sized for the recent elevated mean and volatility and avoids underordering given large observed demand spikes and substantial pipeline already in-flight.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=9988. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders arriving after 4 periods) and recent demand has persisted at a much higher regime since Period_9. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirms 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean), and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR base-stock targets the elevated demand level while accounting for observed lead time and recent variability, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=13739. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently when arrivals occur, so use calculate to let backend confirm average observed LT. Demand has been in a high regime for many periods (recent demands: P34\u2013P38 = 3383, 3624, 3457, 3817, 4068); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine targets a base stock sized to service the elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. On-hand=0, in-transit=14430 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 for observed arrivals. Demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (sustained elevated demands in Periods 9\u201339). I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime and its volatility (20 is the cap for a long sustained regime), so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent realized demand over the review+lead window and reflect recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=11975. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has increased substantially in later periods. I keep L=default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4. To respond to the elevated recent demand and avoid stockouts given large in-transit but zero on-hand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to weight the most recent demand regime (reactive to current high demand). This balances service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost by sizing forecasts to recent observed demand volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=12533. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders with lead_time=4). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_9; to capture recent elevated mean/volatility I use a recent-window estimate. Choices: L by calculate to lock in observed lead time=4; mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over last 20 periods capturing current high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to protect service during the long confirmed lead time while using recent stats to avoid overstock from older low-demand history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=12030. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_9; to reflect the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters (capture last 20 periods). Using recent demand statistics prevents dilution by early low-demand samples and aligns ordering to current demand; keeping L=default (promised=4, confirmed) is justified by multiple lead-time observations. In-transit stock (12030) is large relative to one-period demand but may cover only ~3\u20134 periods of current demand, so basing mu/sigma on recent 20 periods helps the OR backend size orders to meet elevated demand while accounting for holding cost parity (profit=holding -> q=0.5, moderate service target).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=0, in-transit=12111. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4 periods. Recent demand has jumped to ~3.9\u20134.4k (Periods 39\u201343). With promised L=4, review+lead=(1+L)=5 periods; pipeline 12111 covers ~2422 units/period which is well below recent demand (~4000/period) so we must forecast based on the newest high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (last 5 periods) so the OR engine targets supply for the elevated demand while computing safety stock from recent volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: demand has been in a high regime for many periods (recent demands ~4000\u20134470) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 16105 (large pipeline). I keep L = promised (default = 4) because concluded history confirms LT=4 and backend expects promised LT. To make the base-stock target responsive to the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (focuses the forecast on the most recent 5 periods of high demand). This balances service level (capture current high demand) while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering; using recent statistics prevents dilution by much earlier low-demand data.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_9 (sustained large demands through Period_45). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods to capture the current elevated mean and variability. This keeps pipeline coverage = (1+L) periods of recent demand and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_9 (sustained elevated demand through Period_46). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and set demand parameters using the most recent stable regime (cap N to 20 periods) so the OR engine targets stock for current elevated demand while respecting pipeline. This increases service level to avoid lost sales given long confirmed lead time, while sigma_recent captures recent volatility to size safety stock and limit excess holding.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent history shows sustained high demand since Period_3 with multiple confirmed arrivals all at 4-period lead time; on-hand=0, in-transit=14156 (large pipeline). I therefore set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (which average 4) rather than the promised value; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, leveraging full history to size the base-stock while the large in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given heavy pipeline inventory and confirmed lead time.

Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 9 (multi-period elevated demand). I set L=default (promised lead time=4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand periods. Sigma_hat kept as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent high mean) against holding cost given large pipeline already in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4600.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=11494. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (orders arriving 4 periods after order). Demand has been in a high regime since Period 9 (multi-thousand per period); recent periods (P40\u2013P49) show very high demand ~4k\u20134.9k. Pipeline (11494) covers only ~2\u20133 upcoming periods at current demand \u2014 risk of stockouts. Set L to calculated average observed lead time (evidence: many conclude messages with lead_time=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L) periods), and use recent_N N=10 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias ordering to meet the elevated recent demand while the OR engine applies its safety-stock cap.
