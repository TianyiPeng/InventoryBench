Historical demand shows a strong upward trend (107,252,298,376,544). Demand implications: 5-period total historically = 1,577 (period mean \u2248315.4). OR recommended 581 units (base-stock capped policy using promised L and historical stats). Why adjust: recent three-periods show a clear upward regime vs earlier periods (later avg \u2248406 vs earlier avg \u2248219, ~+85%); OR uses all history equally so it underweights the recent surge. Also there is zero pipeline and possible lead-time uncertainty or lost shipments risk, so we should be conservative on stockouts. Tradeoff: holding cost $1 vs profit $4 implies q=0.8 (z\u22480.84) \u2014 stockouts are costly relative to holding. Final decision: increase above OR to partially anticipate the sustained demand increase and to build pipeline that will arrive after the 4-period lead time. I order 900 units (vs OR 581) to provide a larger starting pipeline given the upward trend while avoiding extreme overstock given holding cost and long lead time.
