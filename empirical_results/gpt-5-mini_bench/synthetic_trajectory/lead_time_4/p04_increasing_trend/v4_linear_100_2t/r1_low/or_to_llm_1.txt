Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed earlier as 4 periods (carry-over evidence). Inventory state: on-hand=11, in-transit=501 (total pipeline+on-hand=512). Demand outlook: prior sustained regime shift to higher mean was recorded (Period1\u20135 avg=113.2); recent periods show large volatility with several very large spikes but no new 3+ period sustained change to record. Policy reasoning vs OR: OR recommends 263 but that ignores observed pipeline and uses historical smoothing. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using conservative mean 113.2 \u2192 5-period demand \u2248566 units; current total inventory 512 is slightly below that target, but ordering now will incur an extra period of holding cost ($1/unit/period) equal to profit ($1/unit), so over-ordering is costly. Given large in-transit (501) and high demand volatility, I avoid adding more inventory this period to reduce holding cost and let existing pipeline arrive and satisfy demand; I will monitor concluded arrivals next periods to top up if pipeline proves insufficient. Final action: order 0 units.",
