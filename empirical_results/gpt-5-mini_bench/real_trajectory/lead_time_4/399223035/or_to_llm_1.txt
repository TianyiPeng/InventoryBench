Coverage requirement: with L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering. Demand outlook: recent sustained lower regime (Periods21\u201328 avg = 66.8) per carry-over insight; holiday season (mid-Dec) can push demand somewhat higher but recent weeks (Periods40\u201344) show mixed/soft sales (40,41,90,19,26). Compute coverage need using recent regime: 5 \xd7 66.8 \u2248 334 units. Gap = 334 \u2212 309 = 25 units. OR recommended 132 (uses promised lead time and longer history, high critical fractile due to high profit), but we already have most of pipeline arriving and ordering that much would create excess holding cost. Action: place a small top-up to cover the estimated 5-period shortfall plus a small buffer for holiday variability. Order 30 units (rounded up from gap 25). This minimizes excess holding cost while protecting against mild holiday uplift.

Inventory + pipeline: on-hand = 10, in-transit = 240 \u2192 total committed = 250 units. Demand outlook: recent realized demand has been below earlier historical mean (carry-over noted: recent avg Periods21\u201328 = 66.8, sustained). More recent 5-week demand (Periods41\u201345 = 41,90,19,26,89) averages ~53 units/week \u2192 (L+1)=5 period demand \u2248 265 units. OR recommended 131 units (uses promised L and long-run history) but that ignores current large pipeline. Ordering policy: ensure pipeline+on-hand \u2248 expected 5-period demand plus modest safety given holiday timing and high profit/low holding cost. Pipeline shortfall vs. 5-period demand \u2248 15 units; I add a small buffer of ~15 units to cover upside variability and potential holiday demand, resulting in order = 30 units. This keeps total committed ~280 (>265) while avoiding large excess stock relative to current pipeline and observed demand regime.
