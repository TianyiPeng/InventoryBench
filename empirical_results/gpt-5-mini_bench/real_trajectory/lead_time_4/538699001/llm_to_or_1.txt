Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples (98,95,128,120,190) available; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Promised lead time=4 and no evidence to override. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given modest sample size and no regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows an upward move: historical weekly samples (to 2019-02-04) were [98,95,128,120,190] and Period 1 concluded demand=292 (2019-02-11), suggesting higher recent demand but only one high week so far. On-hand=0, in-transit=190 (order placed P1) and promised lead time=4. No concluded arrivals beyond P1, so actual lead time is not yet confirmed. To respond to the apparent recent demand increase while remaining conservative given limited evidence, use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 3 weeks to capture the uptick. Use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises target inventory to improve service while capping orders per its policy to limit exposure to potential lost shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent historical weekly demand samples (98,95,128,120,190) give mean=126.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=533; two recent orders (P1=190, P2=343) have not yet concluded arrivals but this is expected given promised lead time=4. No concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand mean ~126 units (samples from Jan\u2013Feb). On-hand=0, in-transit=836 which currently covers ~6.6 weeks of typical demand. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded yet but promised lead time is 4 periods and those orders are not yet due to conclude; no confirmed lead-time change. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed regime shift and a large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-4: 292, 265, 194, 168; mean=229.75) is substantially above the older sample mean (2019-01 samples mean=126.2). No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time. To protect service during this sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates (last 4 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat while keeping L as default. This raises target base-stock to cover the higher demand while the OR backend balances profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04): recent avg demand=229.75 vs historical baseline=126.2 (+82%), sustained 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2810.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has risen sharply (carry-over notes a sustained +82% regime starting 2019-02-11). Observed arrival in Period 5 shows an actual lead time of 4 periods (Period1 order arrived Period5); use calculated lead time to confirm. On-hand (40) + in-transit (1174) = 1214 units covers the (1+L) demand forecast. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. For mu_hat I use an explicit forecast based on the recent regime: (1+L)*recent_mean = 5 * 229.75 = 1148.75 to capture the higher demand over the review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 (regime length=4) so variability reflects the recent elevated period-to-period volatility. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) while recognizing ample pipeline inventory and avoiding unnecessary extra orders given large in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical baseline (carry-over notes +82% sustained across 4 periods). Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 for two concluded shipments (P1->P5, P2->P6). On-hand=150 + in-transit=952 provides substantial coverage, but with promised lead time =4 we must plan for (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (regime length=4 \u2192 N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock accounts for the sustained uplift and higher volatility. This balances service (protect against stockouts under higher demand) while limiting excess holding cost by using only the recent regime rather than full-history smoothing.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=205, in-transit=649. Historical concludes show orders placed in P1-P3 arrived with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Given the sustained recent higher demand (carry-over insight) I set L by calculating observed lead times. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock while keeping volatility estimated from recent data. This balances higher service level needed for elevated demand against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08. Recent demand elevated: last 8 weeks mean=232.875 (samples P1\u2013P8), recent volatility apparent. On-hand=189 + in-transit=620 = 809 units; with promised L=4 the OR horizon is 5 periods so pipeline likely short of (5\xd7mean\u22481164). No overdue/lost shipments (all P1\u2013P4 orders concluded at LT=4). I set L to calculate (confirming observed LT=4), and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the sustained higher-demand regime and keep safety appropriate given observed variability. This increases target base-stock to better meet service while avoiding excessive holding cost by using recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been at the elevated regime observed since Period 1 (sustained high weekly demand vs. historical baseline). On-hand=180, in-transit=718 (large pipeline). Observed concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods for multiple orders. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will evaluate to 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained high-demand regime across all available recent samples (Periods 1\u20139) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align ordering to the confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive overstock given already-large pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has been elevated versus historical baseline (recent 6-period mean \u2248231 units/week vs baseline \u2248126), so I bias forecasts toward the recent regime. On-hand=99 and in-transit=921 (pipeline=1020) \u2014 ample coverage but some arrivals are delayed historically; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period behavior. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (captures Periods 5\u201310 demand: 150,233,248,313,240,202; mean\u2248231) so mu_hat reflects the current higher-demand regime across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture current volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma estimate controls safety-stock sizing to limit holding cost given large pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1241 \u2014 this in-transit stock roughly covers ~5 periods at the recent demand rate (5\xd7229.75\u22481149), so pipeline is large but on-hand is zero. Lead time has repeatedly observed as 4 periods; use calculated lead time to lock that in. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (regime length=4); this avoids diluting the forecast with older low-demand data and reduces stockout risk given long lead time and high in-transit but currently unavailable inventory. No evidence of new sustained changes beyond the already recorded regime shift and confirmed LT=4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=57, in-transit=1115 (ample pipeline). Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed arrive after 4 periods). Recent demand (Periods 5-12) is elevated vs earlier baseline and forms a sustained higher regime (8 recent samples). To capture the confirmed lead time I ask backend to calculate observed L. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the current higher mean and volatility while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has been elevated and a sustained regime shift was previously recorded (Period 5 note). On-hand=220, in-transit=905 (large pipeline). Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I set L via recent observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-change higher-demand regime (last 8 demand observations are representative and keep N between 3 and 20). This reduces understock risk given elevated demand while the large pipeline limits aggressive ordering and holding cost exposure.

Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior history; service level target is high (q\u22480.95 given profit $19 and holding $1).

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical baseline; on-hand=471 + in-transit=577 = 1048 units (ample coverage). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. To reflect the most recent demand regime I set L via calculate to use observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last four demand observations (Periods 12-15) so the base-stock aligns with current demand while limiting exposure to older pre-shift data. This balances service (high profit) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-02-11 (carry-over recorded). On-hand=393, in-transit=441 \u2192 pipeline total=834, which comfortably covers several weeks of elevated demand but some in-transit may still be subject to lead-time uncertainty. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods; use calculate to reflect observed average. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock with the promised uncertainty model, set mu_hat via recent_N using the most recent 8 demand samples (captures the elevated regime without overfitting very short noise). Keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (high profit-to-cost ratio q\u22480.95 calls for high fill rates) against holding costs by grounding forecast in recent elevated demand while leaving dispersion to the backend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical baseline (carry-over: sustained regime shift earlier). On-hand 331 + in-transit 621 = 952 units, which currently covers many periods ahead; no evidence of new lost shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use inferred lead time. To keep the OR backend responsive to recent higher demand while using confirmed LT=4, I choose L by calculation (avg observed LT). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent demand regime (~last 8 periods) when computing (1+L)*mean; this biases base stock toward current elevated demand. Volatility uses default to let backend scale sigma by full-sample std over the (1+L) horizon. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts given confirmed LT=4 and elevated demand) against holding cost (large on-hand + pipeline already present).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been well above historical baseline (sustained higher regime). On-hand=371 + in-transit=684 => pipeline+on-hand=1055 units, which at a recent-period demand mean (~183.9 units/week over last 8 concluded periods) covers ~5.7 weeks\u2014adequate but not excessive. No newly missing shipments; historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time 4. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (last 8 concluded demand samples used), which raises the base-stock to meet service level while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR engine's z-derived service target.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24. On-hand=318, in-transit=533; no outstanding overdue arrivals (recent concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals). Observed lead time confirmed at 4 periods historically, so use calculated L to reflect observed data. Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 1 (carry-over previously recorded); I use recent_N with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the (1+L) forecast and volatility responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock from recent realized demand rather than the long-ago baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows the actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and demand has been in an elevated regime since Period 1 of this dataset. Current inventory: on-hand=166, in-transit=816 (ample pipeline). No overdue/lost shipments visible\u2014arrivals have consistently shown 4-period lead time. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 demand observations (captures the sustained higher-demand regime and reduces influence of older baseline data). This balances service level (by respecting the higher recent mean) against holding cost (using a recent-window estimate rather than a wide-sample that may overinflate safety stock).

Demand has been elevated relative to the sparse January baseline but shows variability; to avoid overreacting to recent noise I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=promised lead time.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (observed repeatedly), so set L='calculate' to lock in observed average=4. No recent sustained demand regime change since prior insight, so use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR base-stock grounded in full-sample statistics while the backend applies the profit/holding service quantile; defaults avoid overreacting to short-term noise and handle the currently large pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to low July levels (last 5 demands: 204,158,79,55,35). On-hand=524 and in-transit=583 (total pipeline=1107) \u2014 ample coverage vs (1+L) demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods, so set L using observed data. I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime (most recent 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects recent July demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce over-ordering versus using the full historical high-demand mean while acknowledging confirmed lead time=4 and avoiding stockouts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29. Recent demand has declined sharply: last 4 concluded demands = 79,55,35,23 (average 48). On-hand=790 + in-transit=294 >> expected near-term demand, so we should reduce forecast horizon to recent regime. Lead time history strongly confirms 4-period actual arrivals. Set L by calculating observed lead times (will confirm 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 demands). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect reduced volatility in the same recent window. This keeps orders conservative to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given large on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has fallen sharply from spring peaks to very low July values (Periods 21-25 demands = 79,55,35,23,17). On-hand=814, in-transit=253 \u2014 ample coverage. Historical concludes consistently show 4-period arrivals; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, forecast demand using the most recent low-demand regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5. This reduces target base-stock vs using full-sample means and lowers new orders given high on-hand+pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand has collapsed in summer: last 6 periods demand = [79,55,35,23,17,27], avg\u224839.3\u2014far below earlier regime. On-hand=994, in-transit=46 (ample coverage). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, use recent demand estimates (most recent 6 weeks) for forecast and volatility; keep promised lead time. This reduces mu_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime and lowers sigma_hat to reflect reduced variability, limiting new receipts and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21 (2019-07-01): recent avg demand (P21-P26)=39.3 vs prior baseline~126.2 (\u221269%), sustained 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-480.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21 (avg \u224839.3) versus prior baseline \u2248126.2. On-hand = 1012, in-transit = 0 (no overdue/lost shipments visible). Promised lead time = 4 and actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history, so use default promised L to keep timing aligned. Demand forecast should reflect the post-Period-21 low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (covers the 6-period low-demand regime P21\u2013P26). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture reduced volatility in the same recent window. These choices reduce target base stock to avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and sustained lower sales while keeping safety driven by recent observed variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (avg ~39/week), and on-hand is very high (994) with no in-transit. Lead-time observations consistently show 4 periods. To avoid overstock but maintain service during the confirmed low-demand regime, keep L at the promised value and use recent data (last 8 periods, the detected low-demand regime length) for demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine sizes orders to current low demand rather than the historical high baseline. This prevents excessive future receipts given zero pipeline and high on-hand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=970, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand regime dropped starting Period 21 (P21-P29 recent weekly demand samples: 79,55,35,23,17,27,28,18,24; recent average \u2248 33.6 over P21-P29, and last 9 periods average \u2248 33.6 but last 3 average \u2248 23.3). Inventory is very high relative to current demand; to avoid excessive holding cost, I rely on observed lead time and use a recent-sample demand estimate to size review+lead demand. Choices: L set by "calculate" to use observed lead times (confirmed 4); mu_hat set to "recent_N" with N=9 to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime while using sufficient history; sigma_hat set to "recent_N" with N=9 to reflect recent lower volatility. This produces a conservatively low replenishment target to reduce holding cost while maintaining service given the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand is high (957) and in-transit=0. Demand collapsed starting Period 21 (sustained low demand through Period 30); prior high-demand spike in early periods is historical. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods. To avoid ordering into excess inventory, use lead-time inferred from observations and base demand on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen L: calculate (use observed lead times avg ~4). Chosen mu_hat: recent_N with N=10 to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201330) so (1+L)*mean reflects current low demand and prevents excess orders. Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility in the low-demand regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (2019-07-01) with sustained low weekly sales (periods 21-31). On-hand=946, in-transit=0 and there have been no arrivals in Periods 28-31, so current pipeline is empty. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals P5, P6...); using promised/default lead time keeps OR backend aligned with observed behavior. To avoid overstocking given very low recent demand, I forecast using the recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 21\u201331) to reflect the sustained drop; this reduces target base stock and dispersion relative to historical baseline and prevents excess holding cost while still covering expected demand over review+lead. L left as default (promised 4).

Lead time has been observed as 4 periods repeatedly. To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (P21-P32, length=12) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing target base stock relative to historical baseline and accounting for reduced variability.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand is the low summer/autumn regime that began at Period 21 (weekly demand now ~9\u201327 units). On-hand=925, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero and inventory is ample vs current low demand; no arrivals expected from past orders. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (use calculated estimate). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). For demand parameters use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 21\u201333, length 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower demand; this down-weights the earlier high-demand winter spike and reduces future ordering. These choices reduce base-stock targets to match the new low-demand regime and prevent unnecessary purchases given large on-hand stock.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Product is a seasonal womens jersey top; recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21 (early July) with weekly demand ~20s vs historical baseline ~126. On-hand=916, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained ~39/wk vs historical ~126). On-hand=905, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs current low demand, so avoid large replenishment. Lead time history consistently 4 periods; I use calculate to confirm that. For demand I use recent_N over the entire low-demand regime (P21\u2013P35, 15 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and reduced volatility. These parameters reduce ordered quantities to limit holding cost while preserving service for the low-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (weekly demand mostly 6\u201328 units; long run of low sales), on-hand=899, in-transit=0; lead-time behavior has been consistently 4 periods when arrivals occurred. To avoid excess future holding cost while meeting low current demand, keep L at the promised/default (4). Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (use last 16 periods since the changepoint at Period 21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the low-demand regime rather than the much higher early-year spikes. This reduces target base-stock and cap, lowering ordering and holding costs while maintaining service for the current low-demand pattern.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained ~17 periods) with weekly demand ~10-40 units vs prior high-season levels. On-hand=889, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory today so no urgent replenishment, but parameters should reflect the low-demand regime to avoid excess ordering. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand and volatility I use recent_N over the current low-demand regime to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std (N=17 periods from P21\u2013P37) so the OR backend lowers target base-stock and reduces order cap, trading service level for lower holding cost given sustained lower demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21, with the most recent 12 weeks (P27\u2013P38) averaging ~13 units/week versus historical higher averages. On-hand = 884, in-transit = 0 \u2014 current stock is very large and covers many weeks of expected demand, so avoid aggressive replenishment. Use promised lead time (default=4). For demand forecast use a recent_N estimate to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (capture last 12 periods). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices prevent over-ordering given large on-hand and much lower recent demand, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=878, in-transit=0. Historical series shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21 (avg demand ~39.3) vs prior baseline ~126.2 (sustained many periods). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to match backend expectations. Because inventory is already very high (878) and recent demand has been consistently low, set demand forecast and volatility using the recent low-demand regime to avoid further overstock: use recent_N with N=19 (Period21\u2013Period39 = 19 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This reduces replenishment to match the new, sustained low-demand level and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (P21-P40 avg \u2248 ~11\u201327, sustained >19 periods) and on-hand is high (869) with no in-transit inventory. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor mu_hat to the sustained low-demand regime (covers P21\u2013P40). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices reduce ordering toward the new lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while respecting actual lead time evidence.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Item is a basic womens V-neck tank; calendar is late Nov (post-fall), no upcoming peak for this basics SKU. On-hand=861, in-transit=0; past concluded history shows confirmed lead time=4 and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (avg ~20\u201330/week). To avoid overstock risk given high on-hand and low recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low mean/variance (use up to 20 most recent samples per rules). This reduces future ordering versus historical high-demand periods while the OR backend still balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained drop confirmed P21\u2013P26 onward). On-hand=857, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for several weeks of current low demand, so avoid aggressive restocking. Set L to promised lead time (default=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-P21 low-demand regime (use the most recent 20 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility use recent_N N=20 as well to reflect recent lower variance. These choices focus the OR backend on the current low-demand regime, reducing orders and holding cost while maintaining service given high on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained); on-hand=853, in-transit=0, no arrivals recently (possible prior replenishment stopped). Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm L=4. Given the sustained lower-demand regime (documented in carry-over), I choose L=default to keep promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (use max recent window capped at 20). This avoids over-ordering into high on-hand stock while reflecting the reduced demand, helping the OR engine reduce orders and holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent demand has been in the low post-July regime (periods 21+): very low weekly sales (mostly single digits, recent 20 periods show mean ~8-12). On-hand = 849, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample stock covering many weeks of current demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 but no new evidence to change. To avoid excess holding cost while reflecting the sustained low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and forecast using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to current low demand and reduces replenishment. No urgent overdue shipments flagged.

On-hand is high (847) and pipeline=0; no urgent replenishment needed. Use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (N=18 periods, P28\u2013P45) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-sales environment and avoid over-ordering given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

To avoid over-ordering into high holding cost while preserving service, set L to calculated historical average (4). Forecast demand using recent history to capture the sustained low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with a large recent window (N=20) to reflect the last ~20 weeks' low demand pattern and reduced volatility.
