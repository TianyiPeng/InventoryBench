No concluded arrivals or in-transit inventory observed, so assume actual lead time may be 4 until proven otherwise. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0.

Order = (L+1) * avg \u2248 5 * 126 = 630 units to cover the next 5 periods of expected demand while avoiding frequent stockouts.

  "rationale": "World & product: SKU is a lightweight womens' V-neck strap top; season (late December) and colder weather reduce demand for sleeveless tops. Demand analysis: historical data shows sustained multi-period declines to very low weekly demand (Periods 41\u201346 avg \u2248 ~3.3 units/week, recent =1). Lead time & pipeline: lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; there are no in-transit units. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 464 units, holding cost = $1/unit/period, profit = $19/unit. With current demand regime, on-hand inventory far exceeds expected demand over the lead-time horizon (464 units >> expected next 5\u201310 weeks of cumulative demand). Risk: carrying large inventory incurs large holding cost; ordering risks overstock. Action logic: place no order this period to avoid additional holding costs while exhausting existing stock and to allow demand signals to update before replenishment.",
