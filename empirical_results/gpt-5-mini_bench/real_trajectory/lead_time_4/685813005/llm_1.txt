  "rationale": "Calendar/world: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday season/New Year) \u2014 demand likely elevated. Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals P1\u2192P5 etc.). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=545. Demand history recent (P43-P46): 75,106,121,74 \u2192 recent avg \u224894 units/period. Decision logic: with L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering. Forecast 5-period demand \u22485\xd794=470 units. In-transit 545 \u2265 470 so pipeline already sufficient; placing additional order would increase holding cost without clear benefit. Risk: holiday demand could spike above recent avg, but current buffer (545\u2212470=75 units) provides modest safety. Action: do not order this period.",
