Recent demand has been in the low regime established Periods 34\u201341 (~50 units/week); the last four periods (P42\u2013P45) average \u224852, but P42=140 is a one-off spike (holiday). Using a conservative forecast of single-period demand \u224850, (L+1)=5 periods demand \u2248250. Pipeline (281) already exceeds 5-period demand, so placing additional stock risks holding cost ($1/unit/period) with limited upside given low recent demand and no evidence of a new sustained surge. OR's recommendation (344) assumes higher demand and uses promised lead time; given confirmed L=4 and sufficient pipeline, I place no order to avoid excess holding costs and preserve profit. Monitor arrivals and demand next periods; if sustained demand >60+/period appears, resume ordering to refill to cover (L+1) periods plus safety stock.",

Recent demand regime: Periods 43\u201346 demands = 24,19,26,25 (plus an anomalous P42=140 that depleted inventory); recent stable demand ~24\u201326 units/period.
