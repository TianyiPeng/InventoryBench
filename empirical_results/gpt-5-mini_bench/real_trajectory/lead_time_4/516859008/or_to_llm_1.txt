Need coverage for L+1=5 periods because orders arrive after decision and demand occurs this period: target 5-period demand \u22485\xd7100\u2248500 (using recent avg rounded up toward higher regime). Required order = target 500 \u2212 pipeline 271 = 229. OR recommended 112 (uses historical promised L and different stats); I increase because pipeline+on-hand does not cover 5-period demand under the higher recent demand regime and lead time is 4.

{
  "rationale": "Lead time confirmed = 4 (from carry-over). On-hand = 55, in-transit = 346 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 401 total. Recent demand (Periods 42\u201346) average \u224895 units/period.
