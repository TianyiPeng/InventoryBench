Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand ~18.4 units/week (samples: 13,5,15,28,31). No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Promised lead time remains the only reliable LT input. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=37 (ordered in P1, not yet concluded) so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Historical weekly samples (5): mean=18.4/wk, recent pattern shows rising late-Jan/early-Feb but not yet 3+ period sustained shift. Promised lead time = 4 is still supported (no conclude showing arrivals). Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited history and potential seasonal increase. Note: pipeline (37) is currently well below (1+L)\xd7mean (~92), so the OR engine will likely order to replenish toward computed base stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent weekly demand samples (historical series from Jan\u2013Feb) average ~18.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=80 which roughly covers (1+L)=5 periods demand (~92) but slightly under; however promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet (expected later), so insufficient evidence to change lead-time or demand regime. Use default promised L to let OR backend apply its lead-time, and default demand/volatility (uses all samples) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level versus holding cost while we wait for arrival confirmations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=132. Historical pre-period demands (Jan) avg=18.4 but the last 3 concluded periods show sustained higher demand: 39, 53, 66 (avg=52.67). No concluded arrivals yet for recent orders so no evidence to change promised lead time (still use default). Because the last 3 periods indicate a clear regime shift, I set demand forecasts using the most recent 3-period regime (captures current elevated demand). This increases (1+L)-period demand forecast and variance to drive higher target base-stock and reduce stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: avg increased from 18.4 (prior samples) to 52.67 (periods 1-3), +186%; sustained across 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has jumped and been sustained: Periods 1-3 demands = 39,53,66 (avg 52.67) vs historical mean 18.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (sum of orders P1-P4). Promised lead time=4; all prior orders still in-transit but not yet concluded (arrivals will be visible in Period 6 conclude), so treat shipments as delayed but not confirmed lost. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (backend needs promised L). For demand I use recent_N N=3 to capture the recent higher regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the elevated short-term demand, reducing expected stockouts while avoiding overreaction to older low samples. This balances higher service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=11, in-transit=240. One concluded arrival (Period 5) shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4 (matches promised) but single confirmation is insufficient to change lead-time estimate. Historical baseline mean=18.4 (2019 samples) but recent demand in Periods 1-3 averaged 52.67 (39,53,66) \u2014 a sustained 3-period regime shift. To capture this higher demand I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (covers the new regime). Volatility has also increased, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3. I keep L as default (promised 4) because observed arrival equals promised but is not yet a multi-period confirmation of lead-time drift. These choices raise target base stock to serve the higher demand while sigma based on recent variation balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded lead times: two observations (orders on P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6) both =4, so set L by calculating observed lead times. On-hand=8, in-transit=197 covers multiple future periods; no evidence of additional lost shipments since recent arrivals. Demand showed a sustained uptick earlier (Periods 1-3) but recent weeks (Periods 4-6 = 52,26,46) are lower and variable; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime and higher variability. These parameters bias the OR backend toward provisioning for the recent mean demand over the review+lead horizon while accounting for observed volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=8, in-transit=147. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1-P3 arrived at P5-P7). Demand has recently shifted to a higher regime (recent demands P5-P7 = 26,46,52). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses P5-P7). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend replenishes to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while reflecting recent variability and avoiding overconfidence given delayed arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs pre-Feb: recent concluded demands (Periods 5-8) = [26,46,52,53] plus earlier elevated periods 1-4; on-hand=30, in-transit=124. All concluded arrivals (Periods 5-8) show observed lead_time=4 for prior orders, so actual lead time confirmed at 4. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the elevated recent history (N=8 covers the post-changepoint window), and use calculate for L so backend sets lead time = observed average. This increases base stock to protect service while sigma_recent captures recent variability; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand (Periods 4-9 = 52,26,46,52,53,52) centers ~46.8/unit per period, markedly above older 2019-Jan samples. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1..P5 each arrived after 4 periods). On-hand 48 + in-transit 122 = 170 vs expected 5-period demand ~235, so pipeline may be light vs current regime. I set L by 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-shift regime (Periods 4-9) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand across the review+lead horizon. I also use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to protect service level given confirmed 4-period lead time and sustained higher demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=187. Observed concluded lead times for earlier arrivals consistently 4 periods (orders on P1-P5 arrived with lead_time=4) so actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand shows elevated regime vs baseline with a late spike (last 5 demands = 46,52,53,52,95; mean \u224859.6) so I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the new higher mean while keeping responsiveness to the spike. Set L using calculated observed lead times to match reality. Choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to forecast over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods) using the most recent regime; choose sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect observed recent volatility. These parameters instruct the OR backend to raise the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while limiting excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for completed shipments, so set L by calculate (avg observed). Recent demand has shifted higher vs. historical baseline; use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the new regime (last 5 demands -> higher mean). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while respecting observed lead time and avoiding underordering given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (recent demands: P8=53, P9=52, P10=95, P11=64, P12=95). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 which covers ~5 periods at ~52.8 units/period but below recent-period mean (~71.8). Multiple concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period transit. I set L via "calculate" to use observed lead-time data (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (weights last 5 observed demands). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a forecast focused on the most recent regime and a confirmed lead time so orders will better cover elevated demand while accounting for higher variability and avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has shifted up markedly (sustained high weekly demand since Period 5 with several weeks of 50-95 units) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=291. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 (consistent with promised). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use recent data for demand forecast: set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime (N=10 covers the post-shift periods). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same window to reflect current volatility. Keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals confirm it. This balances fill rate against holding cost given in-transit stock and confirmed lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: last 3 concluded demands = 95, 93, 118 (avg 102). On-hand=0, in-transit=249 which covers multiple future periods given confirmed lead time=4. No evidence of lost shipments recently; lead time has been consistently 4. I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 3 samples) so the OR backend raises base stock to meet the elevated demand while the cap limits excessive ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weekly demand has been high and volatile (Periods 11-15 demands = 64,95,93,118,109; recent mean \u224895.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=281 (several large arrivals recently; lead time previously confirmed as 4). Use promised/default lead time to keep consistency with confirmed observations. Forecast demand using recent data to capture the new high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the last 5 periods, balancing service level against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. On-hand=0, in-transit=373 -> pipeline large relative to demand; confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5...P8\u2192P12). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 1-3 (carry-over): recent demand is substantially higher than the original sample mean (18.4). To reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=12 (covering the recent high-demand regime). For L I let the backend calculate the average observed lead time (evidence shows consistent 4). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to capture current volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while using observed lead time to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been high and volatile vs. early-sample lows; last 5 demands (Periods 13-17) = [93,118,109,89,67], mean=95.2. On-hand=28, in-transit=278 (pipeline large). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet sustained higher demand while sigma reflects variability; large existing pipeline plus conservative recent-based mu/sigma balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained high weekly sales since Period 1\u20133 shift). To reflect the elevated demand and recent variability I set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine base the base-stock and cap on the last 12 demand observations (captures recent regime while smoothing short blips). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but equal profit/holding implies moderate service target).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-24: recent demand is much higher than historical Jan samples (sustained high demand across many periods). On-hand=42, in-transit=271 (healthy pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior history so use promised lead time. Set L=default. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 (periods 15-19 mean demand \u224882.2 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248411) to capture the new high regime while keeping responsiveness. Use sigma recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage with elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=108, in-transit=239 (large pipeline). Historical demand baseline (samples) was low (mean 18.4) but there is a persistent higher-demand regime in recent periods (many weeks of 60-100 demand). Promised lead time = 4 and conclude history consistently shows 4; use default promised L to keep OR engine aligned. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should use recent observations to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime; I select recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent 8 demand observations to balance responsiveness and noise). This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of the recently higher demand and uses recent volatility for safety given equal profit/holding costs.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained high weekly demand through Period 21). To capture the elevated recent demand I use recent_N for demand estimators (long recent window covering the high-demand regime). L set to default (promised 4) since concluded history confirms 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=18 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock and safety stock, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has clearly shifted up vs the 2019-01 baseline (sustained higher weekly sales across many recent periods). On-hand=73, in-transit=197, promised L=4. Many concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time =4 (carry-over already recorded), so use promised lead time. To reflect the sustained higher demand regime I use recent data for forecast and volatility (capture current mean/variance rather than long-ago low baseline). This balances service level (avoid stockouts given substantial recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline: L=default keeps lead-time assumption aligned with confirmations; mu_hat=recent_N uses the last 10 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean so the base-stock reflects recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 captures recent variability for safety stock.

Demand regime shift earlier (Periods1-3) is already recorded; recent demands remain volatile but no new sustained changepoint. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed observations and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample set; this avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while large in-transit inventory reduces urgency to inflate targets.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=65, in-transit=204. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upwards starting at Period 4 (carry-over). Recent demand since the regime change is the relevant basis for forecasting. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (4) which matches observed arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime (21 periods since the changepoint, capped at 20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 20 samples. This emphasizes recent demand, raising base stock to protect service level while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=74, in-transit=216. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=4 consistently; inventory pipeline is healthy but demand has been at a higher regime since early periods. I select L=default to use the promised (and empirically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and current volatility from the most recent 20 demand observations, so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect the elevated demand and variability while accounting for holding cost parity with profit (encouraging moderate service levels).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=12, in-transit=297 (ample pipeline). Historical samples show a sustained higher-demand regime vs initial samples; recent weekly demand is much larger than the early 5-sample mean (18.4). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use promised lead time. To keep orders responsive to the recent high-demand regime while avoiding overstating long-run demand from the small early sample, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 (captures the most recent demand behavior). This balances service (avoid stockouts given sizable pipeline variability) against holding cost by focusing forecast on recent periods rather than the low initial sample set.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (~60-100/week) versus the early-sample mean 18.4; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=50, in-transit=221 (pipeline total=271) \u2014 ample cover vs. expected demand. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time history (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime reflected in the last several periods while keeping responsiveness to recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical data and conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4; recent demands are much higher than the early-sample mean (sustained regime shift to higher weekly demand). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches confirmed 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap using up-to-date demand estimates. This choice leverages the large in-transit stock while ensuring forecasts reflect recent elevated demand, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been materially higher than the original sample mean (historical sample mean=18.4); rolling weekly demand in recent periods is ~60\u201395. On-hand=26, in-transit=268 (pipeline large). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid stockouts, use recent_N demand estimates (focus on the latest 10 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises base-stock while the cap limits extreme orders. This balances service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Demand has been in a higher regime vs. the original sample mean; to capture current demand level and recent variability I use recent_N over the most recent 20 demand observations. These parameters balance service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost by using a recent-window forecast and matching observed lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Pipeline (321 units) covers multiple future periods given L=4; no recent evidence of new lead-time or demand regime changes. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level (using confirmed L and full-sample stats) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

On-hand=0, in-transit=243 (provides some upcoming coverage but demand remains elevated). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime and reduce stockouts I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using N=20 to emphasize the most recent 20 demand observations. This biases the base-stock upward to meet current demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability for safety stock.

Historical concludes consistently show 4-period arrivals (promised lead time); pipeline sizable but current on-hand is zero so risk of stockout this period. I keep L=default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (last 10 weekly samples include the recent high-volume weeks) so the OR backend increases base stock for service while sigma from recent volatility avoids underestimating uncertainty; this balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by focusing on recent demand signal rather than long-ago low samples.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical demand recent window (Periods 30-34) = [98,102,92,167,123], mean=116.4 units/week. Promised lead time=4 and historic concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4. With L=4, review+lead horizon =5 periods; recent per-period mean 116.4 implies (1+L)*mean \u2248582 for mu_hat. In-transit (370) < expected 5-period demand (\u2248582) so backend should replenish to cover higher recent demand. I set L to default (promised=4), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime observed since Period 30; this biases orders toward higher service level while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent volatility.

Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift earlier; on-hand=34 + in-transit=426 = 460 units which materially covers (1+L) periods at historical mean demand. I choose default lead time (promised=4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps orders aligned with long-run demand information while the large pipeline reduces urgency to upweight recent noise; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given current high pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent history shows stable confirmed lead time = 4 and high in-transit (423) with on-hand 0. Demand has been volatile but no new sustained changepoint since previously recorded shift at Period 4. To let the OR engine use its full-sample demand stats while honoring the promised lead time and large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so orders are sized by long-run mean/variance (keeps service vs holding balanced given profit=holding).

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Item 516859008: on-hand=0, in-transit=310. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Demand has been volatile but no new sustained regime change since prior insights. Given confirmed LT=4 and long history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/STD across (1+L) periods. This keeps ordering consistent with observed lead time and lets backend cap orders to control holding cost given current large pipeline (310 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Recent demand has been substantially higher than the early-sample baseline (sustained high weekly sales across recent periods, frequent weeks >80\u2013150). On-hand=49, in-transit=220 covers multiple future periods but demand remains elevated; promised lead time is 4 and past concludes confirm LT=4. I keep L as default (promised=4) to align with supplier promise and confirmed observations. To capture the recent, sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variance from the most recent 10 weeks of sales, improving service during this higher-demand regime while the capped order cap limits runaway orders and holding cost exposure.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-11-11. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=120 + in-transit=213 = 333 units; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. Recent demand has been elevated vs. early samples (sustained high demands through Periods 30-39), so I focus the forecast on the most recent data to avoid dilution by early low samples. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover the next 5 periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N tightens safety stock to recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding=1.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=12, in-transit=338 (total pipeline=350) \u2014 ample coverage vs recent demand spikes. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4; using sample-average reinforces that. Demand recently is much higher than the very early samples; to reflect the current regime I use recent_N on demand and volatility to bias the forecast toward the last ~20 periods (captures recent seasonality and elevated demand). These parameters keep L aligned to observed deliveries while mu_hat/sigma_hat from recent_N reduce stockouts from elevated demand without over-weighting old low-demand samples.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has been high and stable (recent demands ~96,108,106); on-hand=0, in-transit=457 which covers multiple weeks given promised lead time=4. No evidence of new lead-time regime; previous confirmation L=4 remains. To keep responsiveness to the recent high-demand regime while limiting holding risk, set L=default (use promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples, capturing the current elevated mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window so safety stock reflects recent variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=504. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 observations). Recent demand regime is high (many recent weekly demands ~90-150). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to bias mu_hat toward the last 5 observed weeks so the base stock reflects the elevated demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This combination keeps the OR backend aware of the confirmed lead time while raising target inventory to protect service level during sustained high demand, balanced against holding cost via the backend's service-level math.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=110, in-transit=359 (pipeline=469). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2192 use promised/default L. Recent demand shows elevated/variable weekly sales; I use recent_N=5 for demand estimates (captures P39\u2013P43 demands: 96,108,106,115,50) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This yields a forecast (5-period) demand close to pipeline (encourages replenishment to maintain service while limiting excess holding given $1 profit vs $1 holding).

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Product is low-margin ($1 profit, $1 holding). On-hand=152, in-transit=240 (ample pipeline). Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). No new sustained demand regime or lead-time shifts detected. To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost, use the backend defaults so OR engine computes base_stock from all historical demand and promised lead time. This lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using its statistical estimate while respecting the confirmed promised lead time.

Profit and holding cost equal (profit=1, holding=1) implying q=0.5 so z*=0; using backend defaults keeps base_stock = (1+L)*mean demand. No recent sustained demand regime change beyond already-recorded shifts, so use default estimators to let OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample history. This balances service level (use full-history mean across the review+lead window) against holding cost given large on-hand/pipeline.

Recent demand regime shift was already recorded earlier (Periods 1-3); no new sustained changepoint in the most recent history. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed/confirmed lead time. Use default demand sizing: mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) based on seed samples (mean=18.4) so backend will compute the review+lead demand. Use sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from all samples. These default choices keep parameters consistent with confirmed lead time and historical demand while avoiding overreacting to short-term fluctuation; they also let the capped ordering rule limit order size to control holding cost given already-large on-hand inventory.
