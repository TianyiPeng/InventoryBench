Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 660726001 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit; historical weekly demand samples: [0,0,13,27,26] (mean \u2248 13.2). No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet. Use promised lead time (default) L=4 because no actual lead-time evidence. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given limited data and avoids overfitting to the small recent spike.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows an uptick: last 3 samples (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) average ~22 units/week vs earlier zeros. On-hand=0, in-transit=36 (ordered P1) \u2014 arrival promised later (no concluded arrivals yet), so do not infer lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the new higher-demand regime over the most recent 3 weeks. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while keeping variability estimates focused on the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-period avg=22 units vs prior 2-period avg=0 (sustained increase over 3 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=106, recent concluded messages show no arrivals for prior orders (possible delays/losses) but no concluded arrivals to confirm actual lead time. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean) already recorded in carry-over. Given lack of confirmed lead-time observations, keep promised lead time and let OR backend compute mu_hat/sigma_hat from full sample set ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (capture recent higher demand via historical samples) while avoiding premature manual lead-time extensions that risk excess inventory if shipments are actually delayed/lost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent history shows sustained demand increase beginning 2019-01-21 (noted in prior carry-over), sample mean = 13.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=230 equals cumulative orders (36+70+124) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet but shipments present in pipeline (no evidence of loss). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. Because pipeline (230) already comfortably exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (~5*13.2=66), I keep default estimates so the OR backend will recognize existing overhang and scale new orders down. Methods chosen: use default lead time (promised), default mu_hat and default sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has shifted higher starting 2019-01-21 (carry-over: recent 3-period avg=22 vs prior 0) and recent realized weekly demand in Periods 1-4 is 60,146,102,104 \u2014 a sustained, higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=364 (sum of orders placed P1\u2013P4). Multiple past orders remain unconfirmed; however, no concluded arrivals exist to reliably recompute actual lead time, so use promised lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 demand observations (N=4) so the OR engine raises base stock and safety stock to meet elevated demand while defaulting to promised L to avoid over-adjusting for potentially lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing/overdue shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 totaling 364 units remain unconfirmed (no arrivals concluded); possible shipment delays or losses.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has risen and been consistently high over the last 5 periods (demands: 60,146,102,104,95) versus earlier low pre-2019 samples; one arrival concluded (Period 5) shows an observed lead time of 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (pipeline large but arrivals delayed historically). I set L to calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 5 periods). For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias base-stock toward recent higher demand while using observed lead time to avoid under-ordering despite past shipment delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25. Recent concluded arrivals (P5: P1\u2192arrived in P5; P6: P2\u2192arrived in P6) confirm actual lead time = 4, resolving prior overdue-shipment ambiguity. On-hand=0, in-transit=550 which comfortably covers upcoming demand if demand remains near recent levels. Demand has shifted to a higher recent regime (Periods 4-6 demands = 104, 95, 79); I use a recent-window forecast to capture this. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock sized to cover (1+L) periods of the most recent demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4) against holding cost (pipeline already sizable).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime (sustained increase since 2019-01-21); latest 4-period demand average is ~96 units/period. On-hand=19, in-transit=426 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple review+lead periods, so we should set forecasts based on recent demand to avoid overreacting to older zeros. L set to calculated (observed lead times average 4 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping variability measured over the same window; this yields a base-stock tuned to current demand and the high profit/low holding cost ratio to maintain high service with controlled holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=39, in-transit=371 (multiple confirmed arrivals with consistent 4-period lead time). Use calculated lead time to confirm observed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the current higher-demand regime and avoid diluting with much older zeros; this balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. To reflect the recent higher regime I set L via calculate (confirming observed lead time), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) forecast on the last 5 weeks, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases service for the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit stock limits additional ordering risk.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent realized demand has stabilized after the early jump: last 10 period demands \u2248 [60,146,102,104,95,79,105,114,79,87] with recent 5-period average near 96. On-hand=165, in-transit=278; pipeline plus on-hand covers several periods but we must keep provisioning for lead time+review. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). I set L by calculate to reflect observed lead time = 4. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate (covers the most recent regime post-changepoint) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 5 demands) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(recent 5 demands) (backend will compute values). This balances service (protect against stockouts given L=4) while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost vs profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=69, in-transit=358. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6) and recent demand regime elevated since 2019-01-21. Recent 5-period demand (Periods 7\u201311 = 105,114,79,87,96) averages ~96.2/week; using (1+L)=5 covers current review+lead demand (~481 units). I select L=calculate to capture observed lead-time average (confirmed 4). For mu_hat use recent_N N=5 to target the current higher-demand regime and ensure order-up-to covers five periods of elevated demand. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and confirmed L=4) vs holding cost by using recent-demand stats rather than all-time lower historical zeros.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs early zeros: last 6 concluded period demands = [105,114,79,87,96,60], avg \u224890. On-hand=88 and in-transit=385 (pipeline ample but demand is materially above historical pre-shift samples). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes, and arrivals since P5\u2013P10 match L=4. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-changepoint demand regime (N chosen = 6 equals recent regime length), so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent samples. This raises target base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same window so the capped order cap limits extreme ordering given the sizable pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent realized demand has moderated from earlier peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 9\u201313) = [79,87,96,60,40], so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the lower recent mean and reduce overstock risk. On-hand=171 and in-transit=311 (no new missing shipments since lead time was confirmed as 4). I keep L at the promised/confirmed 4 to match observed arrivals. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to adapt to the recent lower-demand regime; set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) for variability consistent with the same window. These parameters reduce excess ordering vs using the long-run mean while preserving service given current pipeline and confirmed L=4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=215, in-transit=235 (healthy pipeline). Historical demand samples show a sustained regime increase beginning 2019-01-21; however current stock+pipeline comfortably covers near-term demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in actual lead time=4. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat = default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given stable lead time and adequate inventory; this avoids overreacting to short-term demand variability while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand has trended down versus earlier spike; to reflect current demand regime I use recent data to set demand forecast and volatility. L uses promised/default (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 observed demands to avoid overweighting early spike). This keeps base-stock responsive to current lower demand while still covering the 1+L review horizon and limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21 and recent weekly demand has fallen to ~20\u201360 units (last 5 periods: 60,40,32,19,18 \u2192 mean ~33.8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand is high (364) with 88 in-transit; no additional evidence of lost shipments recently. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent lower demand, set L by averaging observed lead times, and use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on the latest regime while avoiding over-ordering against stale high peaks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has stabilized at a lower post-launch level vs the initial spike: last 6 period demands = [60,40,32,19,18,15] \u2192 recent mean \u2248 30.7 units/week. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; promised lead time remains appropriate. On-hand 398 + in-transit 39 = 437 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean \u2248 153 units. To keep the OR engine focused on recent demand while leveraging confirmed LT=4, I set L to default (promised), and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 demands: 32, 19, 18, 15, 11; recent mean ~19). On-hand 387 + in-transit 39 = 426 units, which comfortably covers expected (1+L) periods of demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use promised/default L. To size replenishment to current low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent stable regime and variance), allowing the OR backend to compute base stock reflecting lower demand and low volatility. This avoids overstock while maintaining service given large on-hand balance.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand = 400, in-transit = 0. Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 concluded demands: P15\u2013P19 = 19,18,15,11,26) after the earlier regime increase in Jan\u2013Feb. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). No outstanding confirmed arrivals expected. To keep safety stock aligned with the recent low/stable demand while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time, I use L = default (promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent stable regime; (1+L)-period forecast will reflect recent mean ~18 units/week). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current low demand variability. These choices reduce excess ordering versus using full-history averages and balance service level versus holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 16-20 = 18,15,11,26,156) shows one large spike in Period 20 but no sustained new regime (need 3+ periods). To be responsive to recent demand patterns while weighting the most recent weeks, set L via observed lead-times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the recent spike and short-term variability). This keeps the OR backend aware of the recent surge while relying on confirmed lead time so orders cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has surged: last 5 demands = [15,11,26,156,238] with very high mean driven by two large recent weeks (P20=156, P21=238). On-hand=6, in-transit=148 (recent order P21 in-transit). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time. To respond to the recent regime (large recent weekly demand), I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime; L uses observed-history average to confirm lead time=4. This raises the base-stock target to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new demand level while sigma_hat (recent) increases safety stock to preserve service during high variance weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=407. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has spiked recently (Periods 20-22: 156, 238, 129) suggesting a new higher-demand regime starting Period 20. I choose L=default to keep promised/confirmed lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent surge (N=3 covers Periods 20-22); this raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variability so the OR backend will increase base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained spike while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: recent 3-period avg=169 units (Periods 20-22: 156,238,129) vs prior 3-period avg \u224820-40 (sustained increase).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has shifted higher starting Period 20 (Periods 20-23 demand = 156,238,129,111; recent avg \u2248158 across 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=675 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. To react to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding excess ordering given a large in-transit balance, keep promised lead time and set demand forecast based on the most recent 4 periods. Use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime while pipeline_inventory limits order size via the cap.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent sustained demand regime shift starting Period 20 (demands P20-P24 = 156,238,129,111,198) -> higher mean and variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=926 (pipeline large; previous concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4). Use lead time based on observed history, and use recent 5-period demand stats to capture the new high-demand regime and elevated volatility, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20 (P20-25 demands: 156,238,129,111,198,118). On-hand=30, in-transit=875 (large pipeline consistent with many recent orders). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use promised lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the 6-period high-demand regime length). This biases the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent volatility; L kept default so backend uses promised lead time and caps accordingly.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand regime: sustained higher demand starting Period 20 (Periods 20-26 demand series: 156,238,129,111,198,118,138) \u2014 regime length = 7. On-hand=151, in-transit=688 (pipeline=839) so coverage is large but demand remains elevated. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. To capture the post-changepoint higher mean and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (uses last 7 demand samples, matching detected regime length). This focuses the OR base-stock on the new higher-demand regime while using default L to reflect confirmed lead time; large pipeline reduces urgency to inflate orders further.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been in the higher regime that began around Period 20 (multiple weeks of 100+ units). On-hand=320, in-transit=530 \u2192 strong pipeline but recent past showed confirmed 4-period lead times. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 20 (includes Periods 20-27) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-demand periods. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand regime is the higher regime starting Period 20 (Periods 20-28 show consistently elevated demand vs earlier). On-hand=475 + in-transit=346 provides ample coverage now, but demand mean in the recent high-regime is the correct anchor. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201328, 9 samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variance from the current elevated regime, improving service while avoiding excessive hold given current large on-hand/pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=489, in-transit=317. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand regime increased starting Period 20 (recent demands: P20-22 = 156,238,129); recent 3-period mean is the best indicator of current demand. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L based on observed lead times, and forecast demand and volatility from the recent 3-period regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand regime (since Period 20) is elevated versus earlier year; latest demand samples show weekly demand ~80\u2013160 with recent weeks around ~80\u2013100. On-hand=481, in-transit=245 \u2192 pipeline=726 units, which covers multiple (1+L) periods at expected demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=10) to capture the post-change higher-demand regime while downweighting older low-demand data. Sigma left as default to let backend scale variability over (1+L). These choices aim to avoid unnecessary ordering given large pipeline while keeping service for elevated recent demand and controlling holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16): demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20 (sustained elevated weekly demand). Current inventory: on-hand=492, in-transit=262 (pipeline total=754). Recent high demand (Periods 20\u201331) requires forecasting from the new regime rather than historical low-demand periods. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. For demand mean and volatility use recent_N over the current high-demand regime (N=12, Periods 20\u201331) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand and recent variance, helping the OR backend set a base stock that balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given high on-hand but ongoing demand.

Recent demand (Periods 30-32) = [80,99,59], recent 3-pt avg \u224879.3. To capture the current recent demand level I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat and keep lead time informed by observations.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 20 (Periods 20-22: 156,238,129; recent weeks continue elevated: P31-P33 demand=99,59,107). On-hand=461 + in-transit=194 => pipeline=655 units, which comfortably covers several weeks but demand remains elevated. Lead time evidence: concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lag (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use observed lead-time averaging. I set L="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time (will be \u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (N=3 captures most recent strong samples and meets changepoint detection rules). For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability. These choices focus the base-stock on the elevated recent mean while keeping safety stock proportional to recent variability, balancing service level versus holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while the large on-hand position limits urgent ordering. These settings keep target inventory aligned with recent demand, avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand regime elevated since Period 20 (sustained higher weekly demand ~156\u2013238 observed); current on-hand=539, in-transit=67 (total pipeline 606). No new missing-shipment signal; historical arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set demand estimates using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 20\u201335). This keeps base stock aligned to the higher demand while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to capture current volatility. Use default promised lead time so OR backend retains L=4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Current on-hand=586, in-transit=132. Recent demand (Periods 34-36): 22, 27, 20 \u2014 a short 3-period drop from the elevated mid-year regime (Periods 20-33). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To be responsive to the recent lower demand while acknowledging the prior high-demand regime and confirmed LT=4, I keep L as default (promised LT=4). For demand forecast I bias to recent behavior: use a recent_N estimate (N=5) for mu_hat to down-weight older high-volume weeks and capture the recent decline trend. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility rather than long-run variance. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap pipeline replenishment, lowering holding cost risk while retaining some buffer for demand variability given recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows the sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 20 (Periods 20-37 show elevated and variable weekly demand versus earlier low baseline). Observed concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=557, in-transit=132 \u2014 ample cover but demand remains elevated and volatile. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed average lead time (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (to capture the sustained higher mean and variability since Period 20) with N=18 (Periods 20\u201337). This increases forecasted (1+L)-period demand and variance to avoid understocking while the capped order cap limits excessive orders, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has fallen back to ~20-30/week (Periods 34-38 demands: 22,27,20,29,28) after the large mid-year spike. On-hand=529 + in-transit=164 -> pipeline=693, which is ample vs recent demand; past missing shipments have been resolved and observed lead times have been consistently 4 periods. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed average lead time (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus forecast on the latest low-demand regime and avoid carrying excess inventory from the mid-year spike. Sigma likewise uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current lower volatility. This reduces \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 relative to using all historical high-demand periods, lowering orders and holding cost while maintaining service given high profit:holding ratio.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Current inventory: on-hand=519, in-transit=164 (comfortable buffer). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (L=default=4) and set demand estimates based on the most recent stable window (recent_N=6) so the OR engine targets ~5\xd7recent mean; use the same recent_N for sigma to capture current low volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has returned to a low regime (Periods 34-40 demands = 22,27,20,29,28,10,8). On-hand=643, in-transit=32 (total pipeline 675) \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, forecast using the recent low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covers Periods 34-40). This yields (1+L)-scaled recent mean and volatility so the OR backend reduces orders relative to the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 34-41 demands: 22,27,20,29,28,10,8,9) after the large summer spike around Periods 20-27. On-hand=634, in-transit=32 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand, no new missing shipments. Observed concluded lead times have been consistently 4 periods, so use calculated lead time to let backend confirm. To reflect the current low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (captures the stabilized lower mean/volatility while respecting the N bounds). This reduces unnecessary ordering compared to using the full-history summer spike, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the current demand level.

Recent demand has fallen to a low regime (Periods 36-42 demands = 20,29,28,10,8,9,33; recent avg \u224820). Given high on-hand and no in-transit, reduce forecast to recent demand to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirms 4). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (7 most recent concluded demands), balancing service level (high profit/higher target fill) against holding cost risk.

I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime (recent demands: P38-43 = 28,10,8,9,33,9; recent mean \u224816.17) so the OR engine will size orders to the current quieter demand and avoid excess holding cost. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than the full-history variability.

On-hand is high (611) and in-transit=0; there are no overdue shipments currently. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use the confirmed lead time (promised/default) and base demand estimates on the most recent 6 weeks to reflect the current low-demand regime and de-emphasize the earlier summer spike. This keeps the OR base-stock conservative given large on-hand inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=496, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows low baseline with a single large spike in Period 45 (115) likely holiday-driven. Historical actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods \u2014 use promised/default lead time to match observed pattern. To capture recent regime (post-spike) and avoid stockouts while profit/holding imply high service level (q=0.95), set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to weigh the holiday spike but retain recent low weeks. Thus: L=default (promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent average demand across review+lead; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service and holding cost given large on-hand (496) and no in-transit units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=425, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (concluded history). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 20 (sustained higher weekly demand since then). To protect service while avoiding excess stock, use the confirmed L=4 and compute demand estimates from the recent elevated regime. I select recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained regime while capping at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to the higher demand and recent volatility. No new shipment losses detected this period.
