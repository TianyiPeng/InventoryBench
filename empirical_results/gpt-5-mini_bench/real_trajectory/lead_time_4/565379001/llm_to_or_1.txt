Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 565379001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (early Jan\u2013Feb) average ~299 units/week; no arrivals observed yet and promised lead time is 4. To let the OR engine compute base stock using full-sample statistics and the promised lead time, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility (so backend calculates (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps parameters conservative given no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime changes and avoids overfitting to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). SKU 565379001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=337 from an order placed in Period 1 that has not yet concluded (expected promised lead time=4). With only historical weekly samples (mean ~299 over 5 weeks) and no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time or a sustained demand shift, I keep the promised lead time and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L) scaling to the sample mean and sqrt(1+L) scaling to sample std. This balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrivals or multiple-period evidence of lead-time or demand change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands: Period1 demand=273, Period2 demand=506 (large week spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=670 and two recent orders (P1=337,P2=333) have not concluded yet \u2014 arrivals are overdue relative to visibility but promised lead time=4 so no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Because there is insufficient sustained evidence (>=3 periods) of a persistent demand regime change or lead-time shift, I use the promised/default lead time and baseline demand estimates so the OR backend's statistics remain stable while covering review+lead period. This balances service level (covers potential spike) without overreacting and incurring excessive holding cost given only two high-demand observations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=1131, and three consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1\u20133) show orders placed (337,333,461) with arrived=0 \u2192 sustained shipment delays. Because no concluded arrivals observed, I conservatively increase assumed lead time to 6 periods (explicit) to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline when computing (1+L) demand. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) based on historical weekly samples (269,299,301,333,292). This raises target base-stock to protect service level given missing arrivals while capping orders via the engine's cap to limit excess stock and holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed P1\u2013P3 (337,333,461) have not arrived by P3 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 sustained delivery delay; treat actual lead time as increased (evidence across 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent history shows sustained delivery delays: multiple orders (P1\u2013P4) have not concluded, so actual lead time appears longer than promised. On-hand=0, in-transit=1583 (likely delayed). Profit $19 / holding $1 => high service target. I set L explicitly longer to protect against continued delays and keep default demand sizing using all historical samples: mu_hat default uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This raises the base-stock to prioritize fill rate despite holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5163.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=62, in-transit=1687. Recent conclude shows Period1 order arrived in Period5 => observed lead_time=4. Pipeline contains large in-transit volume so use demand stats from historical weekly samples. Set L by calculating observed lead times (use empirical average). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1). This keeps orders sized to cover (L+1) periods of demand while leveraging measured lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). Current inventory: on-hand=102, in-transit=1449. I choose L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (average of confirmed 4,4 \u2192 4) so the OR backend uses realized lead time rather than blind promise. For demand I select 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples (leveraging the provided Jan\u2013Feb samples mean=298.8 and scaling by 5) \u2014 this balances service level given large in-transit stocks while keeping holding cost pressure low.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived in P5\u2013P7 with W=4). On-hand=223, in-transit=1258 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand has been elevated recently (period demands: 273,506,329,298,275,293,340). I therefore set L by calculate to capture observed lead-time data. For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base_stock and the capped order given its full historical sample set; this balances service level given confirmed longer lead time while avoiding overfitting short recent spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent weeks show sustained demand ~300+/wk (last 5 demands: 298,275,293,340,325). On-hand=350 and in-transit=1147 (total pipeline=1497) \u2014 slightly below a 5-period forecast based on recent mean. Lead-time observations (arrivals of P1\u2013P4) consistently indicate 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect observed reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast/uncertainty to the most recent regime and avoid diluting with older Jan samples. This raises target base-stock to better meet service while limiting excess holding given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Historical demand mean \u2248298.8/week (samples 269,299,301,333,292). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals consistently show 4). Current inventory: on-hand=483, in-transit=1056 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=1539, which covers ~5*(mean)=~1494 expected demand over review+lead. I choose default L to use the promised lead time (4) consistent with observed confirmations, default mu_hat to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures baseline demand), and default sigma_hat to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This keeps base-stock sized to historical demand while avoiding excess safety stock given large existing pipeline, balancing service level (profit > holding) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Historical weekly demand mean ~298.8 (samples: 269,299,301,333,292). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded arrivals. Current on-hand + in-transit = 621 + 923 = 1544, which slightly exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (5*298.8 = 1494), providing modest buffer. Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) so prefer service-level focus. Use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and capped order.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1\u2192P5..P9\u2192P13). On-hand=613, in-transit=975. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand pattern around ~280\u2013340, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of available samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run sample mean while the OR cap limits order size to control holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and steady weekly demand (recent demands ~138\u2013340, historical Jan samples 269\u2013333). On-hand=785 + in-transit=723 => pipeline_inventory=1508 (ample cover). To avoid over-ordering given high inventory and low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), use promised/confirmed lead time and let OR backend compute demand stats from full history: L default to keep 4, mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples), sigma_hat default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock computed by the OR engine while capping orders per its cap to limit excess inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P11 all concluded with W=4). On-hand=815, in-transit=693 provides ample coverage vs. weekly historical mean ~299 units. I choose L by calculate to lock in observed lead time = 4. For demand I use default pooling: default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to rely on historical sample mean (mean\u2248299) and avoid overfitting to short-term noise. Sigma_hat uses default to reflect historical volatility across the full sample set. These settings signal the OR engine to target service given profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for confirmed lead time and stable historical demand.

Recent demand has settled lower vs. early-spring levels: last 5 demands = [138,124,92,122,114], avg=118. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service with promised lead time=4, set L to default (use promised lead time), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the lower recent demand (mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstock vs. using all-sample averages while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=1200, in-transit=254. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed at P6 onward). Inventory + pipeline (~1454) comfortably covers several weeks of typical demand; no evidence of lost shipments now. Use promised lead time to align with observed confirmations and let OR backend compute demand forecast and safety stock from full-sample statistics (default methods) to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=1163, in-transit=299. Recent Period 25 conclude shows arrived=0 for an order placed in P25, but lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). No sustained demand regime change detected in history (weekly demands have trended lower recently but not a 3+ period sustained shift requiring a new regime). To keep the OR engine aligned with promised/confirmed lead time and historical demand, I select default methods so the backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats: L=default (promised/confirmed 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level (use confirmed lead time) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and no strong new signal of demand shift.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current inventory is ample: on-hand=1292, in-transit=153, and recent weekly demand has been low (~30\u2013100). Given confirmed LT=4 and high on-hand, use lead-time estimate from observed data and default demand estimates so the OR backend avoids aggressive ordering and reduces holding cost risk.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). Current on-hand=1318, in-transit=115. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5 onward). To reflect observed lead time I'll use 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 4). Demand forecast and volatility will use full-sample defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps orders balanced given high on-hand and modest in-transit while preserving service level under confirmed L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1134.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent realized demand has fallen sharply versus early-sample history: last 5-period demands = [37,35,29,24,12], avg=27.4 units/week. On-hand = 1362, in-transit = 51 \u2014 inventory is ample versus current demand so we should not inflate orders. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history; use promised/default L so backend aligns with observed deliveries. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand behavior; this prevents the OR engine from ordering to the much higher historical mean and reduces holding costs while preserving service. No explicit numeric values provided (backend computes using recent_N).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 25-29 avg demand = 27.4 units/week vs historical sample mean = 298.8 (\u2248 -90%); sustained low-demand regime across last 5 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has shifted sharply lower: Periods 25-29 avg = 27.4/week vs historical mean ~298. On-hand is very high (1364) and in-transit small (33). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid further over-ordering given sustained low-demand regime, keep L as promised (default=4) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low regime: mu_hat -> recent_N N=5. Use sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced volatility in the recent regime. This reduces recommended replenishment while the pipeline and large on-hand cover demand and holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Recent data show a sustained low-demand regime since Periods 25\u201332 (avg \u224827.4 vs historical ~299). On-hand=1372, in-transit=6 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand; pipeline arrivals have consistently shown actual lead time = 4. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service in the new low-demand regime, keep L at promised (default = 4) but set demand forecast using recent data. I use recent_N (N=8 covering Periods 25\u201332) for mu_hat to capture the sustained low mean over the last 8 weeks, and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect reduced volatility. This reduces planned ordering relative to historical levels and balances profit vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=1355, in-transit=0. Historical early 2019 weekly samples ~300 but a sustained low-demand regime was observed across recent periods (Periods 25\u201334). Lead time has been empirically confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. Given the clear regime shift to low demand, I use a recent-window demand estimate to anchor forecast to current consumption (short-run mean/volatility) while letting the backend compute L from observed lead-times. Methods: L set to calculate (use observed lead times = 4); mu_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (covering review+lead); sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This keeps orders conservative given high on-hand and low demand, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service level for current demand rates.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 25 (Periods 25-29 avg \u224827.4 vs historical mean \u2248298.8) and recent weeks show very low weekly demand (Periods 32-36: 6,12,11,11,10). On-hand = 1334, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to current low demand, so avoid new replenishment. Observed lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime and reduce order quantities and holding risk.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 25; last 5 weekly demands ~[12,11,11,10,12] (avg \u224811.2), far below historical ~298.8. On-hand=1322, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock to meet low weekly demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use most recent 5 weeks to reflect current demand mean/volatility), avoiding contamination from much larger historical samples. This keeps the OR backend target stock aligned to current low demand and minimizes unnecessary future holding cost while preserving high service level (profit/hold -> high q).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 25 (weekly demand ~6\u201337, recent 14-period avg \u224827.4) vs historical sample mean ~298.8. On-hand = 1311, in-transit = 0 \u2014 we have ample inventory vs current demand, so avoid large replenishment. Lead times observed consistently = 4 periods in concluded messages, so use calculated lead time. Set demand forecast to reflect the recent low-demand regime using recent_N over the last 14 demand samples (Periods 25\u201338) to scale (1+L)\xd7mean; use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture reduced volatility. These choices reduce order quantities to avoid heavy holding costs while maintaining service for the new low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): demand has settled into the low regime confirmed earlier (Periods 25-39 weekly demand \u2248 6\u201316, far below historical ~299). On-hand = 1305, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid oversized replenishment based on obsolete historical mean, I use recent demand (most recent 5 weeks) for mu and sigma to reflect the sustained low-demand regime; keep L at promised/default (4) since concluded history confirms it. This reduces ordering while preserving service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Lead time historically observed = 4 periods (consistent across concluded arrivals). To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and low demand, set L to calculated observed lead time and set demand forecast/volatility using recent data from the low-demand regime (last 11 periods) so the OR backend will size base-stock to current low demand and reduce ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has collapsed to a sustained low regime since Period 25 (recent weekly demands mostly <40, last 17 periods extremely low: 37,35,29,24,12,16,13,6,12,11,11,10,12,11,6,5,1). On-hand=1299, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for the low-demand regime. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods historically and confirmed in earlier concludes. To avoid over-ordering given the ~90% drop in demand, use recent-N demand estimates (N=17, the detected low-demand regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new lower mean and lower volatility; keep L as default (promised 4) so backend uses promised lead time. This reduces base-stock to match current low demand, lowering holding cost while maintaining high service level given high profit/low holding ratio.

Lead time was previously observed consistently as 4 periods. To reflect confirmed lead time and the sustained low-demand regime, set L via observed average lead times and estimate demand parameters from the recent low-demand regime (use last 13 periods since the changepoint at P30) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low demand and avoid over-ordering given high on-hand inventory and low holding cost sensitivity.

Lead time was previously confirmed at 4 periods; no new lead-time signal. To avoid over-ordering into the current low-demand regime, set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to the most recent low-demand mean and volatility rather than historical high-season samples. This reduces holding costs while maintaining service for currently small weekly demand; no new carry-over insight to record.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 25 (recent 20 periods show very low weekly demand vs historical mean). On-hand = 1282, in-transit = 0 \u2014 large inventory cushion vs current demand. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods repeatedly. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (reduces forecasted (1+L) demand vs historical full-sample mean). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect lower recent variability. These choices tell the OR backend to target much lower replenishment given the large on-hand buffer and low recent demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=1259, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 25 (avg ~27.4 vs historical mean ~298.8). To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand and low demand, use recent-demand estimates. Set L by calculating observed lead times (consistent at 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (choose N capped at 20 per changepoint rules). This keeps orders minimal while maintaining the high service-level implied by profit vs holding cost.
