Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 720504001 has sparse weekly history (samples: 33,41,28,20,52). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=4 periods with no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. No sustained changepoint or shipment delays observed. Use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=55 (ordered Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for that order \u2014 with only one conclude we cannot infer actual lead time (promised L=4 still best). Historical weekly demand mean ~34.8 based on samples (Jan\u2013Feb). No sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given profit/holding cost while avoiding overreaction to a single missing arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (33,41,28,20,52) => mean=34.8, std\u224812.27. No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (55,58 ordered; arrived=0 in conclude messages) so actual lead time is unconfirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=113 (covers \u22483.25 weeks at recent mean) but shipments may still be delayed; insufficient evidence to change lead time. Use default (promised) lead time so OR backend retains 4-period assumption; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd734.8 =174) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2248 sqrt5\xd712.27 \u224827.4 to let the OR engine compute base-stock while avoiding premature regime shifts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Demand history shows weekly mean ~34.8 (samples: 33,41,28,20,52). On-hand=0, in-transit=174 but no concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20133 (orders placed earlier showed arrived=0 repeatedly). This suggests shipments are delayed or lead time > promised 4. To avoid stockouts while backend assumes promised lead time, I explicitly set a longer lead time (L=6) to increase the review+lead horizon when computing base stock. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the backend uses (1+L)*historical mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, which scales safety stock with the longer effective horizon and balances service level against the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (three consecutive periods) \u2014 likely lead time > promised 4 or delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=233. Three+ consecutive concluded periods show zero arrivals for recent orders \u2192 evidence of shipments delayed beyond promised lead time. To be conservative against further delays I set lead time explicitly longer so the OR engine plans for a longer coverage window. L set explicit=6 to cover additional delay risk; mu_hat and sigma_hat use dataset-wide defaults so the backend scales demand (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples. This increases target base-stock to protect service level given delayed arrivals while relying on the engine's cap to limit excessive inventory and holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=33, in-transit=236 (matches orders placed P2\u2013P5: 58+61+59+58=236). Recent weekly demands (Periods1\u20135): 49,54,35,24,22 -> mean=36.8. One concluded arrival shows order placed in P1 arrived in P5 => observed lead_time=4. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent 5 realized weekly demands ((1+L)*mean_recent = 5*36.8 \u2248184) so the base-stock reflects current short-term demand rather than older 2019-01 samples. Sigma kept as default so backend computes volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices reconcile the confirmed lead time, use up-to-date demand signal, and keep variance estimation conservative to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). Current on-hand 57 + in-transit 178 = 235 units in pipeline. Historical weekly demand samples mean = 34.8; (1+L)=5 \u2192 expected demand across review+lead \u2248174 units, so pipeline comfortably covers the upcoming horizon. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (back-end will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps service high while letting the OR engine trade off profit vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent weekly demand has averaged \u224835.4 over the last 7 periods (P1\u2013P7: 49,54,35,24,22,34,30) with moderate volatility (sample std \u224812.06). On-hand=88 and in-transit=117 \u2192 pipeline=205, which already covers a large portion of the upcoming (L+1) demand. Lead-time evidence from concluded messages (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) confirms actual lead time \u22484. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will return ~4). I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (no sustained changepoint beyond normal variation). These choices keep the base-stock anchored to recent demand while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap formula, preventing over-ordering given current pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand (last 8 concluded periods) = [49,54,35,24,22,34,30,55], mean=37.875; (1+L)=5 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248189.4 units. On-hand 92 + in-transit 75 =167 units, which is below the (1+L)-period demand forecast \u2192 risk of stock depletion if demand persists. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods). I choose to infer lead time via calculation from observed lead-times and to use a recent_N demand estimate (N=8) to capture the current regime. Sigma is set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a base-stock sized to meet ~5-period demand while reflecting recent variability and confirmed lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Use calculated lead time to match observed reality and default demand estimates (all historical samples) so OR backend computes base-stock with full sample mean/variance across (1+L)=5 periods. This balances service (use observed L=4) against holding cost given healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=89, in-transit=97; recent demand (Periods 1\u201310) averages ~36.4 units/week. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (covering all available recent periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 observed demands (captures the current demand regime ~36.4). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tied to the confirmed lead time and recent realized demand, preventing under-ordering given on-hand + in-transit and avoiding excess holding from older, lower-sample priors.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent realized lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. On-hand=44, in-transit=140 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but recent weeks show higher demand (weeks with demands: P7-11 = 30,55,22,39,45; mean=38.2). I set L via observed lead times (calculate) to ensure backend uses actual experience. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demand observations) so the (1+L) forecast reflects the recent higher demand regime and variance. This biases orders up versus using stale early-year samples, improving service while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5,P8,P2\u2013P4 etc. concluded with W=4), so use observed-average lead time. Recent demand (most recent 5 periods P8\u2013P12 = 55,22,39,45,31) shows a higher mean than the long-run sample; use recent_N=5 to capture current regime for both demand mean and volatility. These choices give the OR backend a lead time aligned with observed reality and a mu/sigma that emphasize recent demand to balance service level (profit > holding cost) while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost $1/unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand (~Periods 9-13 = 22,39,45,31,24) centers ~32/week with no sustained regime shift. On-hand=66 + in-transit=149 provides ample coverage vs typical demand; several past orders conclusively show lead_time=4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 periods (captures current ~32 mean). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock responsive to recent demand while acknowledging confirmed 4-period lead time and avoiding overweighting older data.

On-hand=35, in-transit=129 provides coverage vs. demand; no clear sustained demand regime shift in available history, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility. These settings keep target service level high (profit/(profit+holding)=0.95) while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and cap using the confirmed lead time and historical demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical weekly demand is stable (samples average ~35 units); no sustained demand regime change detected. To align OR backend with observed lead time and stable demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This balances service (use observed L=4) versus holding cost given modest holding=$1 and profit=$19.

On-hand=49, in-transit=127 \u2014 adequate pipeline but continue using observed lead time. I select L by calculating average of observed lead times (will be 4). For demand, no sustained regime shift detected vs. historical samples, so use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; volatility also default. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost using the confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Current on-hand=27, in-transit=147. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 (multiple orders observed arriving 4 periods after ordering), and there are no signs of recent lost shipments. Pipeline (147) plus on-hand comfortably covers several weeks of demand, so use observed lead time. I choose L by calculation (average of observed lead times) to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine produce the base-stock and cap consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) with inventory risk given adequate pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.) and no ongoing new delays; on-hand=0, in-transit=204. I therefore use L default (promised lead time=4). For demand parameters I choose default methods so the OR backend uses all historical demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 this leverages the full sample set given limited evidence of a sustained demand regime shift while keeping calculations consistent with confirmed lead time. These settings let the OR engine compute the base-stock and the capped order to balance high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) and the 4-period pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand history (periods 5\u201319) shows weekly demand in the ~20\u201355 range; historical sample mean (provided) = 34.8 units/week. On-hand = 28, in-transit = 174 (pipeline total 202). Past concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Using that confirmed lead time, set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand forecast use default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so mu_hat = 5\xd7mean; sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high target fill) while recognizing we already have ~202 units in system roughly matching the (1+L) demand cover.

Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P16 generally arrived after 4 periods); no currently overdue/lost shipments visible. Demand has varied but no sustained recent regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed 4-period arrival pattern. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to recent noise.

LLM Rationale:

Use calculated lead time to reflect observed LT=4 and default demand estimates based on all samples ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) since no sustained demand regime shift or seasonal event is evident; this balances service (use full historical mean) vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Historical observed lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed in concluded messages). I set L by "calculate" to let backend confirm observed average lead time (matches promised=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the lower recent regime (reduces overstocking vs using full-sample mean). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce holding cost risk while preserving service level given confirmed 4-period lead time and current moderate demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals: orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=121, in-transit=59; pipeline + on-hand = 180 units. Profit=19, holding=1 \u2192 target service quantile high (q=0.95). I choose to have the OR backend use observed lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility aggregators so base_stock is computed from full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps the policy aligned with confirmed L=4 and leverages full historical demand to smooth weekly variability while letting the backend compute the z-based safety stock given the high profit/holding ratio.

Pipeline + on-hand appear healthy but demand has varied. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) by letting the OR engine set safety stock (it will target a high service quantile q=19/20).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=81, in-transit=98. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5 and many subsequent observations). Pipeline (81+98=179) provides coverage vs weekly demand history; to keep model aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand statistics, set L by observed average and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use confirmed L=4) and holding cost by relying on aggregate demand stats rather than overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has averaged ~33 units/week over the last 5 concluded periods (P23\u2013P27). On-hand=41, in-transit=136 \u2014 ample pipeline but current period demand still occurs after decision so we cover (1+L) periods. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect observed data. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current demand regime (more representative than all-sample mean). This keeps the base-stock sized to meet recent weekly demand across the review+lead window while sigma based on recent volatility limits excess holdings given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=25, in-transit=124. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in Period 6). Recent demand (Periods 21-28 = 18,17,20,39,28,38,40,49) shows a stable mean around ~31 units with some upward spikes; no sustained regime shift of 3+ periods beyond normal variation. Use promised/default lead time to keep consistent with observed confirmations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to focus the forecast on the most recent two months of demand (captures recent uptick while limiting older data influence). This balances service level (captures recent higher demand) against holding cost by avoiding overreacting to single-week spikes.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving 4 periods after order). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (confirms 4). Demand uncertainty and level will be left to backend historical estimates, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) letting the OR engine compute base stock that balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=189. Recent weeks show two very large demands (90,101) and stockouts, but only two-period spike so not yet a sustained regime change. Historical seed samples are limited; lead time observations in concluded history consistently show 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because there is insufficient evidence (\u22653 periods) to declare a new demand regime; this avoids overreacting to a short spike while the in-transit 189 provides some buffer. This balances service level (use observed LT=4) against holding cost risk from prematurely inflating forecasts.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed Pn\u2192Pn+4). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy and covers several weeks of demand (helps avoid stockouts). Profit/Holding imply high service target (q\u22480.95). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empiric 4-period lead; use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes a high service base-stock while capping daily order size. This balances maximizing profit (high fill rate) vs modest holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=215. Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand upshift over Periods 30\u201333 (90,101,70,151). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages; using default lead time to keep backend aligned with promise. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (the four most recent weeks) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L) demand and volatility around the current spike. This raises target base-stock to satisfy the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for observed volatility. The choices balance higher service level during the demand surge against holding cost given current in-transit coverage may be short for several weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30: avg demand in Periods 30\u201333 = 103.0 units (sustained 4 periods)

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 avg \u2248103 units). To reflect the confirmed L=4 and the new higher-demand regime, set L by calculation from observed lead times and set demand forecast using the most recent regime samples. I choose recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime (Periods 30\u201333), so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over that recent regime, balancing service level (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost (holding cost low relative to profit).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand has shifted up since Period 30 (recent weeks: P30\u2013P35 = 90,101,70,151,93,94; recent mean \u224899). On-hand=0, in-transit=418 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover multiple periods. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4; no new evidence of change. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher regime (periods 30\u201335). I use the same recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while L=default leverages confirmed LT=4; together they steer the OR backend to replenish according to the new demand level without overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Demand has shifted up since Period 30 (sustained higher weekly demand ~103 in P30-33 and continued elevated sales in P34-36). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 units (large pipeline). Many concluded lead_time observations = 4 periods; I use a calculated L to reflect observed reality. For demand I focus on the recent elevated regime: use recent_N=7 to cover Periods 30\u201336 (regime length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while the large in-transit volume prevents excessive additional ordering.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (higher weekly demand through Periods 30\u201337). Lead times have been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use calculated observed lead time. On-hand=0 and in-transit=551 \u2014 substantial pipeline but demand is elevated and volatile; therefore set demand forecast using recent regime data to capture the higher mean and variance. Chosen methods: L by 'calculate' to lock to observed 4-period behavior; mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect the 8-week high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201337); sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. These params steer the OR backend to raise the base-stock for higher service under the new regime while recognizing pipeline inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 30 (weekly demands mostly ~70\u2013151, recent average ~103 over Periods 30\u201333 and continued high demand thereafter). On-hand=51, in-transit=424 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover several weeks of elevated demand. No new evidence of lead-time change since lead time was previously confirmed as 4. I set L to default (use promised lead time 4). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (N=9 covers the recent high-demand window) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets service for the higher mean and observed volatility while the large in-transit mitigates immediate stockout risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has shifted up beginning around Period 30 (sustained high demand from P30\u2013P39). On-hand=142 and in-transit=374 (pipeline=516) provides good coverage vs. elevated demand but shipments arrive with promised 4-period lead time. Evidence: sustained regime starting P30 (samples P30\u2013P39 show consistently higher demand); therefore set lead time to promised (no change) and estimate demand using the most recent regime. I choose recent_N with N=10 (periods 30\u201339) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility; L=default keeps promised lead time=4. This biases the base-stock toward the recent higher demand while limiting excess holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30: average demand ~103 in Periods 30\u201333 and higher subsequent weeks. On-hand=208 + in-transit=285 = 493 units. With promised lead time 4, review+lead horizon = 5 periods; a 5-period demand forecast should reflect the new high-demand regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (regime from Period 30 through current history length ~11 periods) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most relevant post-changepoint samples. This balances service level (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given inventory already in pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (higher weekly demand ~100+). On-hand=204 + in-transit=268 provides coverage but demand remains elevated; with profit $19 and holding $1 the desired service quantile is high (q\u22480.95). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to keep alignment with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime from Period 30 onward, 12 periods available through Period 41) so the base-stock reflects the new higher mean; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a high service level while using recent elevated-demand statistics and confirmed lead-time evidence; no new missing-shipment signal to record.

On-hand=95, in-transit=319 covers multiple weeks; no evidence of new lost shipments and historical concluded lead times consistently 4. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N over the post-shift regime to capture the higher mean and volatility: choose N=13 (Periods 30\u201342 available in this regime). This raises mu_hat to reflect (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat to the recent volatility, improving service for the new higher-demand regime while the backend caps orders to limit excess holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5 etc.). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime detected starting Period 30 (carry-over: avg 103 in P30\u2013P33) and recent periods P34\u2013P43 continue high/volatile demand. On-hand=162 and in-transit=349 provide substantial pipeline but demand remains elevated; to keep service while limiting holding cost I set L to default (use promised 4) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the post-changepoint regime. I choose N=14 (regime from P30\u2013P43 length=14) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant samples, yielding a base-stock tuned to current higher mean and its volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=141, in-transit=358. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations). Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime starting Period 30 (avg ~103 for P30\u2013P33) and demand has remained elevated since. To align ordering with confirmed lead time and the new higher-demand regime, I set L by calculation from observed lead times (will confirm =4). For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and volatility: N=15 (Periods 30\u201344 available ~15 samples). This increases mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability, helping the OR backend compute a higher base stock to avoid costly stockouts but still bounded by the cap to limit holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; no new evidence of change. To align the OR backend with the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory given large pipeline, I use L=default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 (regime length from Period 30 through Period 45 = 16 weeks) so the forecast and volatility reflect the new demand level and variability. This balances service (capture higher mean demand) against holding cost by using recent regime data rather than diluting with older low-demand samples.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Demand regime shifted starting Period 30 (sustained higher demand ~103 in P30\u201333 and continued elevated thereafter). Current inventory: on-hand=106, in-transit=388 (total pipeline+on-hand=494), which covers ~4.8 periods at recent demand\u2014meets the (L+1) coverage for promised lead time. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use default promised L. To capture the post-changepoint demand level and recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current high-demand regime; regime length since P30 is 17 periods, so N=17. These choices give the OR backend an up-to-date mean and volatility while relying on the confirmed L to balance service level vs holding cost.
