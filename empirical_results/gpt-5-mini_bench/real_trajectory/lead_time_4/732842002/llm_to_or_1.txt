Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet (no evidence to infer lead-time change). Historical weekly samples: [0,0,14,52,121] (mean=37.4). Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This balances service (covers 5 periods of observed mean demand) vs holding cost given limited data and a recent upward demand trend in the last two samples.

No sustained lead-time or demand regime change (only one period of non-arrival). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set; this balances service level given high recent demand while avoiding premature manual overrides for lead time or demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime: historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) were low (mean ~16.5) but recent weeks are high (121 on 2019-02-04, demand=131 in Period1 conclude 2019-02-11, demand=157 in Period2 conclude 2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=274 (orders placed in earlier periods have not yet concluded). Per rules, do not assume lead-time change without concluded arrivals, so keep L=default (promised). To capture the recent demand shift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the new higher mean and volatility). This increases target base stock to improve service during the sustained uptick while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to account for higher variability; keeping L=default avoids overreacting to unconcluded shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04: prior mean ~16.5 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-01-28) vs recent mean ~136 (samples 2019-02-04, Period1 2019-02-11, Period2 2019-02-18 and most recent), +~725% increase; sustained for 3+ periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=468 with no concluded arrivals for prior orders (orders placed P1-P3 remain unconfirmed \u2192 possible prolonged lead time or lost shipments). Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-02-04 (recent high demand: 121,131,157,108). I retain promised lead time (use default) because no concluded arrivals exist to calculate actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (the recent high-demand regime of four samples: 2019-02-04 plus Periods 1\u20133) to capture the new higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while avoiding using older low-demand data that would understock given the confirmed regime shift.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=632 (sum of prior orders 122+152+194+164). Historical concluded demands since regime change (2019-02-04..2019-03-04) show sustained higher demand (samples: 121,131,157,108,73) \u2014 recent regime length = 5 periods. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals yet to revise actual lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime to capture the post-change mean/volatility: recent_N with N=5 for both so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, preserving responsiveness to the confirmed demand uplift while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand jumped sharply starting 2019-02-04 and has remained elevated (carry-over insight from Period 3). We have observed one concluded arrival: Period1 order arrived in Period5 \u2192 observed lead time = 4 (matches promise). On-hand=50, in-transit=582 (ample pipeline). To respect confirmed lead time evidence use calculated lead time average from observed arrivals. For demand, use the most recent regime data to capture the higher-demand level: select recent_N over the last 5 periods (covers the sustained post-changepoint regime and meets min N requirement). Match sigma to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices keep the backend forecasting focused on the new higher-demand regime while the large in-transit inventory prevents immediate additional ordering risk.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent data confirm a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-02-04 (higher mean since that date). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed: P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6). Current inventory: on-hand=109, in-transit=475 (no overdue/lost shipments observed). To respect confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, set L by averaging observed lead times, and set demand estimates using the recent post-changepoint samples (7 most recent periods) so the OR backend orders to cover the new regime while capping order size. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by using recent data for mean/volatility rather than diluting with pre-shift zeros.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=352. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1/P2/P3 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand regime is elevated since 2019-02-04 (sustained), so use a recent-window forecast. Set L via calculate to lock in observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new higher demand regime (window covers recent sustained periods) so the backend will size base stock for the elevated mean and its volatility while respecting pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has shifted to a higher regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained); use recent demand samples to capture current higher mean and volatility. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in L=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand regime (so base-stock will size for (1+L) periods of current demand while sigma uses recent variability). This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=720. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P5 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (recent demands: 72,93,317,199,118) \u2014 recent mean ~160 units/week; pipeline (~720) roughly covers ~4.5 weeks. To reflect confirmed lead time and the new high-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 periods to capture current mean/volatility and avoid dilution by older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent data for tighter, responsive stocking.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=1000. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1..P6 arrived after 4 periods). A sustained demand regime shift began 2019-02-04 (mean rose sharply and remained elevated for 3+ periods). To prioritize service during this higher-demand regime while controlling holding cost, I use a calculated L (confirming observed lead time) and recent_N demand estimates to focus the forecast on the new regime rather than older low-demand samples. I select N=8 to cover the sustained post-shift periods available, which lets the OR backend compute base_stock that reflects higher recent demand and appropriate safety stock given profit vs holding cost.

For demand, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime; I set N equal to the recent regime length (7 periods) so the forecast/volatility reflect current demand and avoid diluting with pre-regime low values. These parameters aim to keep base_stock aligned with elevated demand while the large pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: orders on P1..P7 arrived on P5..P11 respectively, lead_time=4)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Demand has exhibited a sustained regime shift starting 2019-02-04 (recent weekly demands: 72,93,317,199,118,82,117,107). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility (covers the 8 post-changepoint samples). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals confirm it. This raises the base-stock to serve the (1+L) review+lead horizon while sigma from recent samples shapes safety stock to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (previously recorded). Recent 10-period average demand \u2248127 units/week; with promised L=4, (1+L)=5 \u2192 expected coverage \u2248636 units. Current on-hand(655)+in-transit(197)=852 > expected 5-period demand, so no aggressive replenishment needed. Use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping lead time at promised default (confirmed historically as 4). This balances service (capture elevated demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand stats and the existing large pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (carry-over noted). Recent realized weekly demand (most recent periods): P9..P15 demands = 118,82,117,107,71,96,92 \u2014 elevated vs pre-shift. On-hand=563, in-transit=262 provides strong coverage vs near-term demand; confirmed lead time history is stable at 4. I choose L='default' (use promised 4) to align with confirmed history and OR expectations. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the sustained higher regime while smoothing short noise (captures last 8 demand samples). Sigma also recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base-stock targeted to current high demand, while using recent samples avoids overreacting to single-week spikes and limits excess holding given high on-hand inventory.

Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting 2019-02-04 (higher mean sustained 3+ periods). Pipeline + on-hand well above one-period demand but we must preserve service with elevated demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=14) to capture the post-change higher mean; same N for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the sustained higher-demand regime while L=calculate ensures backend uses observed lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been in the higher regime (confirmed in prior carry-over: ~+725% since 2019-02-04) and remains sustained; on-hand=542, in-transit=218 (healthy coverage). Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use promised/default L to align with confirmed behavior. To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent 8 demand periods, balancing recency and sample size). This raises the base stock to service the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; together they push order-up-to appropriately to avoid stockouts but limit excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained); recent demand much larger than pre-shift. On-hand=505, in-transit=192 (no missing shipments visible; past concludes confirm LT=4). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set lead time based on observed lead times and use recent-demand statistics (captures current mean/volatility). Using recent_N with N=14 uses the most recent regime data while respecting the N selection rules. This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

To reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (capture recent high-regime behavior, N=15). For lead time I use calculate to let backend confirm observed average (historical observations all show LT=4). This raises base_stock to serve elevated demand while the low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) justify conservative service targeting.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained); current on-hand=490 + in-transit=289 provides strong coverage vs recent demand but some past orders showed 0 arrivals when expected (possible transient loss) so remain conservative. Set L to promised lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with confirmed lead-time evidence. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (capture recent mean/variance); choose N=16 to cover the sustained high-demand window while capping sample length. These parameters increase target base-stock to preserve service in the new regime while sigma_hat from recent data ensures safety stock reflects current variability, balancing profit ($19) against holding cost ($1).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. Recent demand (last 10 periods: P12..P21) averages ~74.2/wk; regime shift from low winter to higher spring demand was previously confirmed. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 576 + in-transit 164 = 740) comfortably covers (1+L)*recent mean ~371, so no explicit upward adjustment needed. I set L to default (use promised/confirmed 4). I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-shift demand regime and recent volatility, so the backend targets ~95% service level while avoiding excess holding given the already-large on-hand position.

Holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=$19, holding=$1) so using recent demand stats preserves service while limiting excess safety stock. L chosen as default (promised lead time=4).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Demand has been in the elevated regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained higher weekly sales). On-hand=619, in-transit=36 \u2014 ample cover now but demand remains above pre-shift levels. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use promised/default L. To reflect the persistent high-demand regime, set mu_hat using a recent-window average to weight current higher mean; use N=20 (capped by available samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean of the most recent 20 observations. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstocking from old low-demand data while preserving service level under the confirmed higher-demand regime and known lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=636, in-transit=61; demand regime shifted up in early Feb and has remained elevated for 20+ periods. Observed concluded lead times = 4 consistently. To capture sustained higher demand I use recent_N=20 for demand mean/volatility; to reflect confirmed lead time I use calculate so backend averages observed lead times. This balances service (capture new higher mean) vs holding cost by using recent samples rather than all-history which would underforecast.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand regime (large Feb jump) has been sustained since Period 3; recent weekly demands (P12..P25) are moderate. On-hand=573, in-transit=70 \u2014 ample cover but we must keep provisioning for ongoing demand. Lead time confirmed historically as 4; use promised lead time (default) so backend uses L=4. For demand level and variability, use recent_N over the most recent 20 samples to capture the sustained post-shift regime and downweight older low-demand samples. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand exhibited a large regime shift in early Feb (sustained), but more recently (Periods 20-26) weekly demand has declined and stabilized at lower summer levels (demands: 24,41,45,40,17,65,72). To reflect the current recent regime I set L to default (promised = 4), and use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 7 weeks, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand stabilized at a higher regime since 2019-02-04 (previously recorded). Current inventory: on-hand 400, in-transit 133 \u2014 healthy coverage versus current demand but we must still replenish for lead time + review. No recent missing arrivals beyond confirmed lead_time=4. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime while limiting lookback to the most relevant recent periods; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward the higher, sustained demand regime and account for observed variability, balancing service level (profit=$19) against low holding cost ($1) by using a 20-period recent sample rather than the long historical mix.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=382, in-transit=93. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed Periods 5..25 arrivals); promised lead time = 4 so use default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting 2019-02-04 (much higher mean since then), so use a recent-window forecast to focus the mu/sigma estimates on the post-shift regime. I choose recent_N with N=20 to capture recent 20 samples (gives stable estimate while emphasizing the new higher-demand regime). This raises base_stock to maintain service given long lead time while sigma from the same recent window sets safety stock to balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=327, in-transit=89 (pipeline=416). Historical conclues confirm actual lead time=4 periods. Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-02-04 and has remained elevated; to capture the post-shift demand distribution I use recent samples. Set L to promised (4) to match confirmed lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples (post-shift), which raises target base-stock to protect service level given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand (last 6 periods: P25..P30 = 65,72,101,77,66,88) indicates a sustained higher-demand regime vs the very low start of the series; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture current mean and recent volatility. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use default (promised) L. Current on-hand (302) + in-transit (72) = 374 provides strong coverage vs short-term demand but I still prefer recent_N to keep forecasts responsive to any further regime shifts. Methods: L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the most recent demand regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Current on-hand=237, in-transit=141. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed P1..P7 arrivals P5..P11). Recent demand has moderated from the large Feb spike; last 5 demands = 101,77,66,88,65 and extending further back shows similar mid-range. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 4). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures recent ~2 months of demand while meeting the N selection rules). This balances service (covering lead+review periods at current demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover near-term demand but recent weekly demand levels remain elevated vs pre-shift. I keep L as default (promised 4, supported by concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-shift regime while smoothing shorter noise; apply same recent_N choice to sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward the higher sustained demand regime while avoiding overreacting to single-week spikes, balancing service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=120 + in-transit=208 provides 328 units. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 and promised lead time remains appropriate. Recent demand (last several weeks) centers ~60-100/week; to capture the current regime I use a recent_N estimate to bias forecast to the latest behaviour. I choose N=8 to cover ~2 months of recent data while avoiding older low-demand samples from Jan-Feb spike. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR engine size base stock for the current demand volatility and avoids overreacting to the early-2019 spike. L kept at default (promised 4) since concluded history matches it.

To capture the sustained higher demand while keeping lead-time as promised, set L to default (use promised=4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast/volatility on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (~Feb onward) so the backend builds a larger base stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders via its cap parameter to limit overstock and holding cost exposure.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained >3 periods); recent weeks show regular weekly demand ~40\u2013100 with many samples in the high regime. On-hand=133 and in-transit=249 (pipeline=382) covers multiple weeks (L+1 periods). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. I choose L='calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time average (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (N=20 captures the most recent stable samples while smoothing older low-demand data). This keeps base stock responsive to the long-lasting demand increase while limiting excess holding: using recent demand stats raises target stock to meet service levels given the higher demand and observed LT, while recent sigma controls safety stock sizing. No evidence of new lost shipments requiring explicit LT inflation.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=141, in-transit=218 (pipeline=359). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and demand regime elevated since early Feb (sustained). Pipeline + on-hand currently provides healthy coverage vs recent weekly demand, but to keep service high while avoiding excess holding I use a recent-window demand estimate. L: use promised/confirmed lead time so arrivals are scheduled correctly. mu_hat: use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint regime and reflect current demand levels over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. sigma_hat: use recent_N to reflect recent demand volatility (so the backend's z* safety stock is tuned to current variability). Recent_N window set to 12 to balance responsiveness to recent weeks while smoothing week-to-week noise; this keeps base_stock adaptive to the sustained higher-demand regime and limits unnecessary overstock given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=113, in-transit=239. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime since early Feb (already recorded). Promised lead time remains reliable (confirmed historically =4). Use L=default to keep backend lead-time = promised. To keep forecasts responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing noise, use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility reflect the last 20 samples. This supports a high service level (q\u22480.95 from profit/holding) while limiting excess stock build from very old low-demand weeks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=171, in-transit=157. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4; pipeline + on-hand currently covers several weeks of demand. Demand regime shifted up in early Feb and has been stable at the higher regime since; to capture recent demand while smoothing older low-season samples I use a recent window for demand forecasting. Choices: L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed historically), mu_hat=recent_N with N=12 to focus forecast on the most recent 12 demand observations (captures current higher regime), sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (protects against stockouts under the higher regime) with holding cost by not over-expanding the uncertainty estimate.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=203, in-transit=264. Historical concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 31-39) shows a lower post-summer level versus earlier 2019 spike; to reflect the most relevant demand regime I use recent_N over the last 9 concluded demand samples (Periods 31-39) for both demand mean and volatility. Keeping L as default (promised/confirmed 4) preserves proper pipeline coverage; using recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat reduces excess holding while the high profit (profit=19, holding=1) still yields a high service-level target in the OR backend.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods; I therefore keep L at promised/confirmed. Demand shifted up early Feb and has since settled to a higher regime; to capture the recent demand profile and avoid legacy low-sample bias I use recent_N=20 for both mean and volatility (captures the most recent ~20 demand periods). This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost by sizing base stock from recent demand and variance rather than all-time low pre-shift samples.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=226, in-transit=181. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=4 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand rose sharply early (recorded carry-over) but recent weeks show lower, more stable weekly demand. To prioritize service while controlling holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high target service level), use promised lead time (default) and base forecast on the most recent demand regime. I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last ~20 weeks' demand behavior (balances responsiveness to recent demand declines vs smoothing), while leaving L as default so the OR backend assumes the contractual 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: orders on P1..P7 arrived on P5..P11 respectively, lead_time=4); Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04: prior mean ~16.5 -> recent mean ~136 (+~725%), sustained for 3+ periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (sustained large uplift). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=188, in-transit=157 (pipeline total=345) \u2014 sufficient buffer but must account for (1+L) periods of demand. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N on a long recent window (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent seasonality while avoiding dilution by the low pre-2019-02-04 samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the elevated demand mean and measured recent variability, balancing service (profit per unit $19 is high vs holding $1) with holding cost by relying on recent data rather than the older low-demand samples.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Historic concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=322, in-transit=27 (healthy buffer). Recent weekly demand has moderated vs earlier 2019 spike; to prioritize recent demand while retaining some memory of past variability I keep L as promised (default) and use EWMA for mu_hat with moderate smoothing (gamma=0.3) so the (1+L) forecast emphasizes recent weeks. Sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from full history (captures long-run variability). This reduces risk of over-ordering from legacy high early-2019 spikes while maintaining service level given confirmed LT=4 and current inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been low-moderate (past concludes: 23,31,23,31,62,33,27,18,48,64,49,40,62,66,77,... mostly 20\u2013100 with recent weeks ~20\u201340). On-hand=291 and in-transit=35 provide substantial coverage versus (1+L) periods. Lead time has long been confirmed at 4 periods in history and there is no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change. I therefore use default (promised) lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance for (1+L) period forecast; this balances service (avoid stockouts given current inventory) against holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weekly demand has been much lower than the early-2019 spike; last 8 concluded demands (P39..P46) = [18,27,33,62,23,31,36,38], avg \u224834. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history (stable). On-hand=217, in-transit=217. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) so mu_hat reflects the current low-demand regime (reducing excess inventory risk). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility.
