Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is basic sweatpants with no visible seasonality signal in provided history. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and historical sample stats (no recent changepoint detected) so backend computes base_stock from (1+L)\xd7mean of samples; profit=holding implies target service quantile 0.5 (z=0), balancing fill rate vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand history (Jan\u2013Feb weekly samples) shows mean weekly demand ~74. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=119 (order placed P1; Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0). The single non-arrival is insufficient to declare a lead-time change or lost shipment (need \u22653 periods of consistent evidence). Promised lead time (4) will be used so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L) adjustments from full historical samples. Using default methods keeps forecasts anchored to long-run weekly demand while the pipeline (119) covers multiple weeks; this balances service vs holding given Profit=Holding. Monitor future concludes for lead-time or loss signals and update if arrivals fail to appear after promised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=233. Two recent orders (P1=119, P2=114) have not concluded; no concluded arrivals so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Historical weekly demand samples (121,57,75,63,57) mean=74.6. I will use the promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently. This balances service-level targeting from historical mean while avoiding premature adjustments given lack of concluded arrivals or sustained regime change evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (Period1-3 conclude) = 69, 52, 51; historical samples (Jan) also lower than earlier 121 spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (large pipeline) and promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet so do not infer a lead-time change. I choose L=default to use promised 4. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent realized demand regime (69,52,51) which reflects current lower run-rate. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices keep forecasts responsive to the current lower demand while the large in-transit pipeline will be reconciled by the OR engine when arrivals conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand samples average ~74.6/week (samples: 121,57,75,63,57). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 which nearly covers (1+L) periods of demand if L=4. All past conclude messages show arrived=0 so no confirmed shorter/longer lead time yet (no concluded arrivals); missing arrivals could be delays or lost but not sustained/confirmed. Therefore keep L at the promised default to avoid over-adjusting, and use default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (sizable in-transit stock) against holding cost without overreacting to unconcluded shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=71, in-transit=224 (matches orders from P2+P3). Period 5 conclude shows arrived=119 (ordered P1) with lead_time=4 \u2014 confirms promised lead time. Use calculate for L to lock in observed lead time (avg observed = 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures baseline weekly demand from provided history). This balances service (profit=holding, so q=0.5) vs holding cost given confirmed L and limited on-hand inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Historical weekly demand samples: [121,57,75,63,57] (mean=74.6, std\u224824.11). On-hand=148, in-transit=133. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods (arrivals from P1\u2192P5 and P2\u2192P6). No evidence of lost shipments. I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (captures full review+lead demand) and scaled volatility sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (maintain coverage for 5 periods given confirmed L=4) against holding cost (profit=holding \u21d2 q=0.5, backend will set safety factor).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=218, in-transit=48. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1-P3 arrived with W=4). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (average=4). For demand I use default estimators so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to let the OR engine use the full-sample baseline (covers the full review+lead horizon and is robust given limited recent data). This balances service level vs holding cost while accounting for confirmed 4-period lead time and current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5-8) ~48,37,40,49 -> mean 43.5, lower than long-run sample mean (74.6) due to a sustained lower-demand regime over the last 4 periods. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. To avoid excess holding (profit=holding), I downweight older high outlier (121) and use a recent-window demand estimate. Set L by calculated observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the new regime length=4). This keeps (1+L)-period demand forecast aligned to current lower demand and reduces overstock risk while preserving service against the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=123, in-transit=80. Historical weekly mean (Jan samples)=74.6; recent realized demand (Periods 5-9: 2019-03-11 to 2019-04-08) = [48,37,40,49,46], mean=44.0. Lead time was confirmed as 4 in prior insight, so use promised/default lead time. Demand appears to have shifted down persistently, so set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect lower recent variability. These choices reduce excess ordering and holding while preserving service given sustained lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 5 (2019-03-11 to 2019-04-08): avg demand fell from 74.6 (Jan samples) to 44.0 over 5 periods (-41%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has declined vs. Jan: P5-P10 demands = [48,37,40,49,46,24], recent mean \u224840.7. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 in prior concludes. Inventory: on-hand 122 + in-transit 74 = 196 units. With L set to observed average (4), review+lead horizon = 5 periods; 5\xd7recent mean \u2248203, so pipeline is slightly short and ordering should top up. Choose L via calculate (use observed lead times). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent lower-demand regime (N=6) to reflect the sustained drop and reduce forecast vs. historical Jan samples. This balances service level (cover ~5 periods of reduced demand) while avoiding excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P5,P6,P7,P10,P11). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 5 (~44 avg). On-hand=122 + in-transit=57 provides ample cover short-term. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm the 4-period reality; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime to reflect the sustained drop (N=7 covers Periods 5\u201311). These choices reduce overstating demand and avoid excess holding given profit=holding= $1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=110, in-transit=39. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 5 (recent demands: 48,37,40,49,46,24,25,44). To respect confirmed LT and recent lower demand, keep L on promised (default) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=72, in-transit=86. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods across concluded history; recent demand since Period 5 shows a sustained lower regime (avg \u224839 units/week over last 9 periods vs historical 74.6). To match the confirmed lead time and recent lower demand, use promised lead time (default) and base-stock demand estimates from the last 9 observed periods so the OR backend reduces order targets to reflect the lower regime while preserving service level under L=4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods historically; demand has declined since Period 5 and recent 5-period average is lower than earlier samples. On-hand=56, in-transit=106 provides coverage vs confirmed L=4 but demand stayed subdued; to reflect recent lower demand and variability I use recent_N with N=5 for demand mean and std to let the OR engine size base stock to the current regime while keeping promised lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=24, in-transit=100. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods consistently. Demand has shifted down versus Jan baseline; recent weekly demands (Periods 9-15) average ~36- Forty-ish and appear sustained. To capture the recent lower regime I use recent_N=7 (last 7 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. For L I request calculation from observed lead times to confirm the persistent L=4. This balances service (use recent lower mean to avoid overstock) while retaining variability estimate from the same recent window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=9, in-transit=137. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 (consistent). Demand has been lower since the regime shift noted earlier; recent demand (Periods 12-16 = 44,38,33,40,29) best represents current mean/volatility. To avoid excess holding while maintaining service with profit=holding, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the downward regime and current variability. This keeps pipeline coverage at (1+L) periods using recent observed demand rather than older, higher Jan samples.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-10. Recent demand has remained in the lower regime confirmed earlier (Periods 5\u201317); last 5 demands = [38,33,40,29,17], mean \u224831.4. On-hand=39, in-transit=128 (ample pipeline). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and prioritize avoiding excess holding cost, use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility while keeping L as promised (default). This provides the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled forecast tuned to the recent regime and reduces overstock risk given current high pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=46, in-transit=91 (total pipeline=137). Demand has been lower since Period 5 (sustained drop); recent weeks show lower volatility and lower mean than early samples. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift regime (more representative recent mean/variance) so the OR engine targets service with lower forecasted demand and avoids excess holding given $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-24. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 5 (user note: avg fell from 74.6 to 44.0, sustained). On-hand=35 and in-transit=112 (total pipeline 147) \u2014 ample coverage for a 4-period lead. Confirmed lead-time evidence exists historically; use promised/default L. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the regime (use N=15 periods covering Period5\u2013Period19) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing orders versus Jan levels and balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5 (avg demand \u224844 over that earlier 5-period window and more recently lower). Current inventory: on-hand=78, in-transit=85 => pipeline_total=163. Using promised/default lead time keeps consistency with observed L=4. Demand has clearly shifted down; I use a recent_N forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 16-20: 29,17,30,13,8; mean=19.4 => (1+L)*mean=97) so set mu_hat via recent_N N=5. Volatility likewise estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). With (L+1)=5, pipeline 163 > mu_hat ~97 so orders will be small or zero; this balances service vs holding cost given high holding cost equal to profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Current on-hand 103 + in-transit 47 = 150 units. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and no persistent lost-shipment signal. Demand regime shifted down starting Period 5 (sustained lower mean ~44). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime, keep promised lead time (stable evidence) and use recent_N demand estimates over the lowered regime (Periods 5\u201321, N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base stock relative to earlier high-demand samples. This balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent realized lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Demand has exhibited a sustained downshift since Period 5 (avg ~44 vs Jan baseline ~74.6). On-hand=77, in-transit=55; pipeline + on-hand (132) comfortably covers near-term demand but we should size replenishment to the lower recent regime to avoid excess holding given equal profit and holding cost. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (use large recent window to capture the regime since Period 5). This reduces target base-stock and caps holding costs while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=64, in-transit=64. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand drop beginning Period 5 (avg fell ~41%). Use promised/confirmed lead time to align pipeline (L=default). Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime: select recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean over the most relevant recent periods. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep inventory sizing responsive to the sustained lower-demand regime while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time, reducing excess holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit).

Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has remained in the lower regime identified earlier (Period 5 onward): recent weekly demands (Periods 20-24) = [8,13,26,36,11], mean=18.8. On-hand=77, in-transit=40. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes, so use promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost ($1 each) I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat captures the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses the same recent_N to reflect recent variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5. Recent history (P1\u2013P25) confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained lower-demand regime (recent mean ~35.4/week vs earlier ~74.6). On-hand=14 + in-transit=40 -> pipeline=54, which is well below a 5-period demand forecast. To let the OR engine apply its statistical safety-stock rule with full sample history and the confirmed lead time, I use default lead time and default demand estimates so base-stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples). This avoids overreacting to short fluctuations while ensuring the engine will replenish toward the multi-period forecast.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand is variable with a prior sustained downshift (recorded) but large recent spike (Period 26 demand=124). On-hand=0, in-transit=112 (covering some future demand). Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes confirm L=4; use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes L=4. To react quickly to recent volatility and the large spike in the last period, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent 5 demand observations, balances responsiveness vs noise). This keeps ordering responsive to the recent regime while the backend will compute safety stock via q (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=0, in-transit=206. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; recent arrivals align with promised L=4. Demand has shown a large spike in the last two periods (P26:124, P27:212) after earlier subdued months, so we must tilt forecast toward recent higher demand but avoid overreacting to only two extreme points. I use L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 weeks including the spike) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand across the (1+L) review+lead window. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock and allowed order cap to reduce stockouts while the cap will limit extreme overshoot given high holding cost (profit=holding cost => 50% fractile).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=428. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals match ordered P -> arrived P+4). Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 11, 63, 124, 212, 151) shows a new high-demand regime starting ~Period 25. To respond to the sustained spike and avoid stockouts given L=4 and one-period observation delay, keep L at promised/confirmed value and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the elevated mean/volatility. Methods chosen: L=default (promised/confirmed 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect (1+L)-period demand under the new high regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This increases target base stock to prioritize service (profit and lost-sale cost symmetric to holding cost), while the backend cap limits extreme ordering.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=561. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. Recent demand shows a sustained surge over the last 5 periods (P25\u2013P29) with large stockouts\u2014use recent 5-period demand to capture current regime. Use promised/default lead time (4) so OR backend aligns with observed arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the elevated demand mean and volatility observed in the last 5 weeks; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost since in-transit is already large.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge starting Period 25 (2019-07-29 to 2019-08-26): avg demand=131.6 over 5 periods, up +199% vs prior regime avg 44.0

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=578 (large pipeline arriving in future periods per concluded messages). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4; recent demand regime is the elevated surge starting Period 25 (strong, sustained last 5 periods: P26-30 demands = 124,212,151,108,112). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demand samples (captures the surge). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect the recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while reflecting observed variance; using recent samples avoids diluting the surge with earlier low-demand data and helps balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand regime: surge beginning Period 25 persists. Last 7 demands (P25\u2013P31): [63,124,212,151,108,112,71], mean=120.14. On-hand+in-transit = 55+581 = 636 units. Promised lead time=4; (1+L)=5 \u2192 5\xd7recent mean \u2248 600.7 units demand cover. I therefore keep L at default promised lead time and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders if pipeline already covers the 5-period demand. This balances service (higher mu_hat from surge) against holding cost given a large pipeline.

On-hand=219, in-transit=359 (ample pipeline). Use promised/default L to match observed confirmed lead time.

To be responsive to the sustained surge while avoiding excessive stock, use promised lead time (default) since LT is confirmed, and base demand estimates on the most recent surge regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (capturing Periods 25\u201333 demand behavior) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent surge samples.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; promised L=4 is appropriate. Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 112,71,58,85,78) averages ~80.8, noticeably below the earlier surge (Periods 25-29). To reflect the current post-surge regime I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures current mean over last 5 weeks). Demand volatility has also changed since the surge, so I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices give the OR backend a forecast spanning (1+L) periods based on the latest regime and keep orders aligned with on-hand (286) + in-transit (183) to avoid excessive holding given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand returned to ~70\u2013112 after the Aug surge; on-hand=338 + in-transit=54 gives ample coverage versus recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To keep service high while avoiding extra holding, use promised lead time and set demand estimates from the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 30\u201335) which capture the post-surge normalization. This keeps mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the recent lower regime while the large current inventory reduces urgency to order.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand (Periods 32-36) = [58,85,78,77,62], recent mean \u224872/week. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand 276 + in-transit 63 => pipeline 339, comfortably covering several weeks at recent demand but we should anchor forecast to the most recent regime. Set L to promised (default=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, focusing replenishment on the current post-surge demand level and avoiding excess stock from the prior surge.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand (last 5 weeks) stabilized near ~76 units/week after the summer surge subsided. On-hand=196, in-transit=84 \u2192 pipeline=280 units, which covers roughly (1+L)=5 periods at current demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use default promised L to keep OR engine alignment. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-surge regime (most relevant for the next 5-week coverage) and avoid diluting with older low-demand winter/spring samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given current weekly demand ~76) against holding cost by using recent volatility for sigma_hat rather than long-run higher variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=183, in-transit=121. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand (Periods 34-38 = 78,77,62,80,67) averages ~72.8 and represents the current demand regime (post-surge but above pre-surge levels). To reflect the current regime I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the most recent 5 periods. Using the confirmed promised lead time keeps timing aligned with observed arrivals; the recent-N demand estimate prevents overreacting to older surge/spike data while keeping service given profit=holding (q=0.5) balanced.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=117, in-transit=181. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4. Recent demand (last ~10 weeks) is moderate (roughly 60-80/week) after the summer surge; to capture this recent regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 10 samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. L uses default (promised) since concluded history matches promised lead time. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent moderate demand while the OR backend will cap orders to limit oversupply given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=65, in-transit=252. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, ...). Recent history shows earlier regime shifts (summer surge) but current weeks demand ~60-80; use conservative defaults tied to promised lead time to let OR backend apply full-sample estimates. Choose L=default to reflect promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=5\xd774.6\u2248373 demand across review+lead; sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding cost given sizable pipeline and on-hand inventory, avoiding aggressive extra ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=12, in-transit=231. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P5,P6,...P41). Recent demand (Periods 37-41 = 80,67,66,61,74) shows a stable mid-high regime (~70 units/week) versus earlier summer surge; use a recent-N demand estimate to reflect current weekly run-rate. Set L by calculate to use observed lead times (avg=4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the immediate 5-period demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Use sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend apply long-run variability; with profit=holding the backend will target median service (z*=0), so these parameters balance service level vs holding cost while accounting for confirmed lead time and recent demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=12, in-transit=245. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; promised lead time is 4. Recent demand regimes: past carry-over insights already recorded (summer surge then fall normalization). Pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) is large (257) relative to typical weekly demand, so avoid increasing forecasted demand; use default statistical estimates so OR backend uses full history and promised lead time. Therefore set L=default to use promised lead time (4), mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples), and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level given high pipeline while avoiding extra holding from explicit up-forecasting.

Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 66,61,74,91,51) shows a moderate/volatile Dec demand; no new sustained regime shift detected. Set L=default to use promised/confirmed 4.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent observed actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=36, in-transit=242 \u2192 healthy pipeline but arrivals are only visible next period. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 61,74,91,51,65) averages ~68; we are in the post-surge/stable winter regime (no new sustained changepoint). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding cost), set L to default (use promised 4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current late-Nov/Dec demand level rather than older regimes. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent variability. These parameters signal the OR backend to target base-stock around current short-term mean\xd7(1+L) and volatility from recent weeks so orders won't overshoot given large in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand shows a year-end spike with large sales and stockouts in Periods 45-46 (demand 118,153) and elevated demand in the prior 6 periods (P41-P46 = 74,91,51,65,118,153). On-hand=0, in-transit=294 (will cover some upcoming demand but arrival confirmation only visible later). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent elevated/seasonal regime I set demand forecast using recent_N on the last 6 samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high-variance, high-mean period; this balances service (avoid stockouts) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.
