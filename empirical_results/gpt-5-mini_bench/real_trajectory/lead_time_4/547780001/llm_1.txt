No seasonal driver apparent for mid-Feb. b) Demand analysis: Historical weekly sales for SKU 547780001 show a high outlier 2019-01-07=121 followed by four more stable weeks: 2019-01-14=57, 2019-01-21=75, 2019-01-28=63, 2019-02-04=57. Excluding the early spike, the recent 4-week average \u224863 units/week; recent variance moderate. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 4 periods but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). No in-transit inventory and no evidence of lost shipments. Treat supplier as uncertain; must cover (L+1) periods. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so zero coverage for current and upcoming periods. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory is costly; accordingly avoid large safety buffers. e) Order logic: To ensure service across the promised lead time plus current period, order to cover (L+1)=5 periods \xd7 expected demand \u22485\xd763 = 315 units. Given high holding cost, I avoid extra large safety stock. Final action: order 315 units for SKU 547780001.",
