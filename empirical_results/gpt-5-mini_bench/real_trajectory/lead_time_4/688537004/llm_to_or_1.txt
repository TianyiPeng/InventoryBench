Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent history shows two zeros (2019-01-07,01-14) then three higher weeks (69,88,88) indicating a sustained uptick. Promised lead time used (default=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the new regime; (1+L)=5 so backend will scale the recent mean accordingly. For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect variability in the new regime. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the five-period review+lead under the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimates recent so holding cost is not overstated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=0 -> recent avg (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=81.67 (N=3), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21: three most recent samples = [69,88,88], mean \u224881.67. On-hand=0, in-transit=100 (order placed in Period 1 not yet concluded). Use promised lead time (default) since only one conclude period exists and lead time not yet confirmed. Set mu_hat based on recent_N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (covers review+lead demand). Set sigma_hat recent_N=3 to reflect observed volatility in the new regime. This biases the OR backend toward stocking for the higher recent demand while keeping lead-time assumption conservative given uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=195 (orders from P1/P2) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 no confirmed lead-time change. Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (avg of last 3 samples = 81.67). I therefore keep L as default (promised = 4) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new, higher-demand regime. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=296 but no concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3 (arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be confirmed from conclude messages; shipments may be delayed but backend must assume promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent mean \u224881.67 over 3 samples). I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given observed higher demand while keeping volatility estimate recent to limit excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand regime established (weekly demand \u2248 70\u201395; recent periods: 77,94,69,79 \u2192 recent mean \u224880). On-hand=0, in-transit=398 which approximately covers (1+L)=5 periods at ~80/wk (\u2248400), so avoid inflating orders. Promised lead time remains the operational default; use recent 3-period demand to set mu_hat so the OR backend targets the elevated regime while sigma stays default to reflect historical volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=304; recent concluded arrival confirms actual lead time=4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5). Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 is sustained (recent mean ~81.67 over 3 samples). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the new higher-demand regime (captures recent mean/volatility and avoids diluting with prior zeros), balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=348. Concluded arrivals show orders placed P1->arrived P5 and P2->arrived P6, confirming actual lead time=4. Recent demand has risen: last 3 concluded demands = [79,124,172] (avg=125), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime versus earlier samples. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed=4). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher mean over the most recent regime and avoid diluting with older zero/low samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices direct the OR engine to raise target base-stock and safety stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time and higher recent demand while keeping variance estimates focused on the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand regime: sustained jump starting 2019-01-21 with recent 3-period avg \u224881.7 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=449 (covers multiple future periods). Promised lead time=4; historical concludes confirm LT=4. I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (calculate (1+L)\xd7mean over last 3 samples). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent spread. These choices focus orders to cover (L+1) periods of the new regime while avoiding overreaction to older zero-demand samples and limiting holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=574 (large pipeline). Historical demand shows a sustained uptrend since 2019-01-21 with recent high weekly demands (periods 4-8: 79,124,172,198,309). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed confirmations). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (use last 5 demand observations) to capture the recent high-demand regime while limiting weight from older zero-demand history. This gives the OR engine a forecast that reflects the new higher mean and volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts during spike) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 5 and remained elevated through Periods 5-9 (demands: 124,172,198,309,308). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I use L=default to keep promised/confirmed lead time=4. For demand I select recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher regime (Period5-9, regime_length=5) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated mean across the review+lead horizon. I also select sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders per its policy to limit overstock risk.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has shifted up (sustained high demand since Period 5); last 6 demand observations (Periods 5-10) capture the new regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=972 \u2014 ample pipeline but we must respect observed lead time. Set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (confirmed 4 in recent concludes). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the 6 most recent periods to capture the new higher demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices align base stock to the sustained demand increase while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has clearly risen from the early-sample low (0s) to a sustained, much higher regime: recent weekly demands (Periods 5\u201311) = [124,172,198,309,308,306,433]. On-hand=0, in-transit=979 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate based on the last 7 demand samples (Periods 5\u201311) to capture the new high-demand regime and avoid dilution by the earlier zeros. Use recent_N sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to meet much higher current demand while acknowledging a large in-transit pipeline that will arrive under the confirmed L=4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1095. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline (1095) >> expected (1+L)\xd7mean historical demand, so no additional safety required. I therefore use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std; this will cap orders to zero given the large in-transit volume, avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Demand jumped beginning 2019-01-21 and has remained elevated (periods 5\u201313 demands = [124,172,198,309,308,306,433,383,322]; recent regime length = 9). Use observed lead time (calculate) to reflect confirmed L=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to anchor forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (covers review+lead demand), protecting service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=1002 units. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P10 arrived after 4 periods). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent periods (P5\u2013P14) show consistently large weekly demand. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (average=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 10 demand observations (captures the sustained high-demand regime and recent variability). These parameters ensure the OR backend builds base stock to cover the current high-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and variance; given large in-transit (1002) we expect pipeline to cover several review+lead periods without immediate extra risk of stockouts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=1247 (several recent arrivals confirmed with 4-period lead time). Recent demand has shifted up and stabilized (sustained high weekly demand ~300 in last several periods). I keep L as promised (default=4) since concluded history repeatedly shows 4-period actual lead time. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8) to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime (reduces understock risk vs using full-history mean). This increases target base-stock to balance service (profit = holding cost) while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand has been high and volatile; last 4 concluded demands = [322,364,346,538], recent average ~392.5, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping L at the promised/default (which matches observed). Using recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. This balances service (capture elevated demand) versus holding cost (large pipeline already present).

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1880. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4; promised lead time=4 so use default L. Recent demand is elevated and regime-shifted (sustained since 2019-01-21) and last 5 observed demands (Periods 13-17) = [322,364,346,538,379]; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current high mean and volatility.

Recent demand has been in a higher regime (many periods of 300+ demand from P8\u2013P19). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent 15 demand samples to bias mu_hat and sigma_hat toward current demand levels while keeping L at the promised/confirmed 4 so the backend orders against the correct pipeline horizon. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) vs holding cost (large in-transit already limits new order size).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand summer regime since late April (Periods 13\u201320) with weekly demands large (322\u2013799) versus earlier low volumes. On-hand=0, in-transit=1212 (multiple confirmed 4-period arrivals historically). Promised lead time = 4 and past conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4, so keep L = promised. To capture the recent high-demand regime and elevated volatility, use recent_N for demand mean and std using the most recent regime (Periods 13\u201320, length=8). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat toward current summer demand so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to avoid stockouts while accounting for higher variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=15, in-transit=1373. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand, so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent weekly demands (late May\u2013Jun) are elevated and more volatile. I set L=default to use promised 4. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the latest high-demand regime (balances responsiveness to recent surge vs smoothing), and same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to target a base_stock tuned to recent high demand while capping orders via the backend cap to avoid excessive incoming volume.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed earlier); recent demand has been elevated and volatile since the regime shift in Jan\u2013Feb but no new sustained changepoint since. Pipeline is large (2037) so I will keep the backend's default demand aggregation and promised lead time to avoid overreacting to short-term volatility. Using defaults lets OR compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance and the promised L=4, balancing service vs holding given the large in-transit balance.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1449. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed P5/P6/P7/P8...); recent demand has been elevated but no new sustained regime change beyond the earlier Jan shift. To avoid overfitting and because shipments have been concluding reliably with L=4, set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost using the provided profit/holding ratio. This respects the pipeline (1449) and lets the backend cap orders appropriately.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (observed in concludes P5/P6/P7/P8 etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=333, in-transit=763. With promised L=4 and substantial pipeline, I use default lead time and let the OR engine compute (1+L)-horizon demand statistics from full history so ordering reflects long-run mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to noisy week-to-week swings while the pipeline remains large. Defaults also respect the backend cap calculation and balance service vs. holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=821, in-transit=427 -> ample coverage vs recent weekly demand spikes; no newly observed lost shipments (recent concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals). Use promised/default lead time to align with observed confirmed LT=4. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) because a sustained regime shift to higher demand was already recorded earlier and there is no new changepoint; this keeps the OR backend forecast robust to long-run history while the capped order logic limits excessive ordering given current large pipeline and on-hand balance.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. Recent demand has fallen from midsummer peaks (P24=713) to current levels (last 5 demands: 436,713,383,245,180). On-hand=641 and in-transit=664 provide ample pipeline cover; past concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 but use promised default to remain consistent. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime while weighting the recent spike, so the OR backend will compute a (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty reflective of the last 5 weeks, balancing service versus holding cost. No evidence of a new sustained lead-time or demand regime change since prior insights.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=504, in-transit=1316. Previously confirmed actual lead time=4 and no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts in recent concluded periods (Periods 25-28 show moderate demand and inventory accumulation). Profit and holding cost are equal, so use default statistical policy with promised lead time to let backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility. Default L keeps consistency with observed arrivals; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let OR engine use full-sample estimates to balance service vs holding given current pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2. On-hand=401, in-transit=1286; pipeline + on-hand provides large coverage vs recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history and promised lead time is 4. Recent demand (last 4 concluded periods: P26-P29 = 245,180,137,133) is lower than earlier seasonal peaks, so use a recent window to set demand forecast and volatility to reflect current regime. Using L=default keeps promised lead time (4). mu_hat set via recent_N (N=4) to base stock on current lower-demand regime. sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability and avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost.

Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks; to be responsive I use a short recent window to estimate demand across review+lead. Chosen L=default to trust promised lead time (4). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime and avoid being pulled by large summer spikes. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive (lower safety stock after demand drop) while L=default avoids overreacting to transient shipment noise.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4; demand experienced a sustained regime increase starting 2019-01-21 (3+ periods). No new sustained changepoints detected. To keep policy simple and leverage full historical demand stats, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std. This avoids overfitting to recent low-demand weeks while the large on-hand position already provides cover; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=1464, in-transit=0; promised lead time=4 and past concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. Recent demand has declined vs earlier summer; current on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand, so keep promised L to match supplier expectation and avoid over-adjusting for transient arrival noise. Use recent_N (last 5 weeks) for demand mean/volatility to capture the recent downshift (reduces ordering and holding risk). This balances service (coverage for current low demand) against holding cost given high on-hand.

Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded lead times consistently =4; stick with default promised L to align with supplier promise. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (5-period regime length -> N=5). This keeps target base stock sized to the new lower demand and reduces overstock risk while preserving service given large on-hand buffer.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=1353, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (weeks 29-35 demand: 133,67,69,45,42,71,40 -> recent 7-week average much lower than earlier peaks). No new evidence of lead-time change; historical concluded lead time=4. To align orders with the sustained lower demand, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the base-stock and cap on the most recent low-demand regime (N chosen = regime length since Period 29 = 7, satisfies 3+ periods). This reduces overstocking risk while preserving service given large on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=1319, in-transit=0; recent demand has downshifted and stabilized around ~70 units/week since Period 29. Lead time historically confirmed as 4, so use promised lead time (default). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (last 8 weeks: P29\u2013P36) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility rather than the long-run higher mean, avoiding unnecessary additional receipts and reducing holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has downshifted since Period 29 (week-of 2019/8/26) \u2014 recent weekly demands: 133,67,69,45,42,71,40,34,21 (Periods 29-37) \u2014 sustained lower regime. On-hand is high (1298) and in-transit=0, so we avoid inflating forecast from older high-demand periods. Confirmed lead time history shows L=4 historically; no recent evidence of change. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (N=9 periods, Periods 29-37) for mu_hat and matching recent_N for sigma_hat; this focuses the forecast and variability on the new lower regime and prevents over-ordering given large on-hand stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=1263, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has downshifted and stabilized since Period 29; last 6 weeks avg=40.5 (down from ~71 earlier). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclues and there are no new late/lost shipments. To keep service while avoiding extra holding cost, use promised lead time and base demand estimate from the recent downshifted regime. I choose recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (available regime length = 10 periods), so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 10 samples. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service level given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=1228, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory vs. recent low demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods, so keep L as promised to match observed behavior. Demand has been in a lower regime since late Aug (Periods 30-39); I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast to the most recent 11 weeks (captures the sustained low-demand regime and reduces exposure to earlier high-season spikes). This keeps base-stock conservative (lower mean) to avoid excessive holding cost while preserving service given current ample on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand further downshift starting Period 30: avg=53.8 units/week (Periods 30-39, N=11), sustained 10 periods

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1180, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 30-40) has settled lower (~45\u201371, avg \u224849) and prior carry-over confirmed the downshift starting Period 30. No recent arrivals observed; pipeline=0 so we must size orders from current low-demand regime. Use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (N=11 weeks: Periods 30\u201340) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and volatility, balancing service (cover L+1 periods) versus holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=1155, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have repeatedly confirmed the promised L=4; no recent arrivals because no orders were placed in recent periods. Demand has a sustained downshift starting Period 30 (avg \u224853.8 units/week across the subsequent 11 weeks), so I use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce future ordering to avoid holding costs. Using L=default keeps promised lead time (4) for the OR engine; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=11 to capture the lowered mean and volatility over the confirmed low-demand regime, which steers the base-stock lower and limits excess inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has downshifted since ~Period 30 (weeks 2019/9 onward); last 13-week mean \u224846.7 units/week, volatility lower than earlier peak season. On-hand=1080, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for several weeks; no concluded arrivals expected. I keep L at promised (default=4) because lead time was previously confirmed as 4 and no new evidence of change. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period 30\u201342) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 13 samples, capturing the sustained lower-demand regime and avoiding overweighting earlier peak-season spikes. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to reflect current volatility in the same recent regime. These choices reduce overstocking risk while maintaining service for the current lower-demand environment.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=1043, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 4 and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-43 mean \u224844 units/week, N=14). Given high on-hand relative to current demand and equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), use promised lead time and a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the downshift while capturing recent variability. Choices: L=default to keep promised 4; mu_hat=recent_N using last 14 demand samples (captures the sustained lower-demand regime); sigma_hat=recent_N using last 14 samples to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to current lower-demand level and avoid further overstocking while preserving service with the observed lower demand.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (weeks 2019-09-02 onward). I choose L=default to use promised lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 30\u201344) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=15 to reflect the lower recent volatility. These settings tell the OR backend to size base-stock to recent lower mean and variance, avoiding unnecessary replenishment given large on-hand stock and equal profit/holding (which implies a conservative target service level).

On-hand=961, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory now, so no urgent replenishment risk. Lead time has been historically 4 and promised is 4, so use default.
