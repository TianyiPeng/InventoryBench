Demand regime analysis: recent history (Periods 30\u201345) shows a sustained low-demand regime (~40\u201370 units/week, often ~30\u201350) for 16+ periods. Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods historically; currently no in-transit stock and no overdue arrivals. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 1,176 units, which is many weeks of coverage vs. current low weekly demand; holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit/unit, so carrying excess inventory sharply reduces objective. Final order logic: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and because on-hand inventory comfortably covers expected demand over the lead time plus safety.",

Given profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period, carrying inventory yields net zero or negative marginal value if unsold; with limited foreseeable demand and no benefit to stocking extra, avoid further inflating ending inventory.
