Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 572797001 has historical weekly samples (111,117,92,109,103). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. No sustained changepoint or seasonal signal evident given limited data. Use promised lead time and defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively until real arrivals/lead-time evidence appear.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent visible demand: Period1 demand=128; historical weekly mean from provided samples = 106.4. No concluded arrivals yet (Period1 ordered=122 arrived=0) so actual lead time cannot be inferred; shipments could still be in-transit. On-hand 0 + in-transit 122 likely covers \u22481\u20132 weeks but not the full review+lead horizon. I select L=default (use promised 4 periods) because we have no confirmed lead-time observations. For demand I choose mu_hat=default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples = 5\xd7106.4 to reflect historical baseline while avoiding overreacting to a single recent week. For sigma_hat I choose default to reflect historical variability. These conservative defaults keep service levels aligned to historical demand while avoiding over-ordering given uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~106.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (orders from P1/P2 have not yet concluded but may still be in transit); no concluded arrivals yet so do NOT infer lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid premature assumptions. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio (profit=$4, holding=$1). No strong, sustained evidence of demand or lead-time regime change yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=440. Past three periods show orders placed (P1=122,P2=131,P3=187) but arrived=0 each period; demands in P1-P3 were 128,207,175 (recent mean high vs older baseline). I keep L as default (promised 4) because no concluded arrivals exist to reliably recalculate lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher mean (170) and elevated volatility observed in the last three demand samples, which will raise the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts given the large in-transit uncertainty. This balances profit vs holding cost by targeting service for the recent demand regime while keeping lead time at the contractual promise.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (122,131,187) all show arrived=0 by their conclude messages \u2014 suggests possible lost/delayed shipments (sustained for 3 periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=676. Concluded history shows orders from Periods 1-4 did not arrive (arrived=0) \u2014 sustained missing shipments for 3+ periods. To be conservative against potential lost/delayed shipments, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised so the backend inflates the review+lead demand. Chosen L explicit=6 to cover extended uncertainty; mu_hat explicit set to (1+L)*historic mean \u2248 7*106.4 = 744.8 to cover 7 periods of demand; sigma_hat explicit=22.5 (conservative volatility ~ default sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 22.4). These parameters raise the base-stock target to protect service level despite missing arrivals while acknowledging holding cost via moderate sigma.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 (122,131,187,236) all concluded arrived=0 \u2014 sustained missing/delayed shipments across 4 consecutive periods

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=54, in-transit=642. Recent concl.: Period 5 shows arrived=122 (ordered P1) => observed lead_time=4. Missing arrivals from later orders remain possible but one-conclusion confirms lead time=4. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (captures the confirmed 4-period lead time). Demand forecasting uses 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples) to leverage full sample history and keep target service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed Period 1 arrived Period 5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 Period 7. On-hand=112, in-transit=511. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) mean\u2248106.4. Two concluded arrivals show orders from P1\u2192P5 and P2\u2192P6 => observed lead times = 4 periods. Pipeline likely contains orders placed in P3\u2013P6 that will arrive with the same 4-period lag. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service (profit/holding ratio) while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed Period 1 arrived Period 5; order placed Period 2 arrived Period 6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Historical weekly demand samples (111,117,92,109,103) give mean=106.4; confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded messages (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=227 + in-transit=371 = 598 units, which covers (1+L)=5 periods demand under historical mean (5*106.4=532) so no escalation needed. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence; use default demand sizing (1+L)*mean of all samples and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR backend computes the base-stock and cap consistently with observed demand and the confirmed lead time, avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock despite past missing shipments which now show consistent 4-period arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and shipments that were previously delayed have since arrived; on-hand=266, in-transit=189 giving healthy pipeline coverage. Demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb 2019 weekly) show no new sustained regime shift. Use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and std scaled by sqrt(1+L); this leverages full historical sample averages while letting the backend combine profit/holding to set service quantile.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) give mean \u2248106.4 units/week; recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand 237 + in-transit 298 = 535 units, which roughly equals (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*106.4 = 532, so pipeline + on-hand already covers the next (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand. Missing shipments seen earlier have since been resolved and lead time is stable at 4. Therefore use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to earlier transient missing shipments while keeping inventory near the target coverage for a profit/holding tradeoff (profit $4, holding $1 implies moderate service level).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand history shows weekly demand ~106 units (samples: 111,117,92,109,103). On-hand=102, in-transit=450 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=552, which slightly exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (~532) so no aggressive uplift needed. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes; I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments (use full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L)). This balances service (coverage for 5 periods) vs holding cost given healthy pipeline.

To avoid overreacting to intermittent missed arrivals and to align with confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=666. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Recent shipments resumed and no sustained new demand regime detected; use observed lead-time information. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). Use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leverages full historical demand mean ~106.4 per week, yielding (1+4)*mean \u2248532 demand over review+lead). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 moderate service target) while avoiding overfilling given large in-transit inventory (666 units) and holding cost exposure.

Demand historical samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~106.4/wk; no sustained demand regime change since. To avoid overreacting to transit noise and because lead time is confirmed, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L).

Recent concluded history consistently shows a 4-period lead time; shipments that previously appeared missing have since concluded at LT=4. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend uses the full-sample (historical) mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=5 \u2014 a conservative approach given supply uncertainty and current healthy pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=148, in-transit=306. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new sustained regime shifts in demand or lead time since last insights. Pipeline + on-hand (454) provides buffer vs recent high weekly demand spikes (up to 240) but holding cost is nontrivial. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed 4-period arrivals and use default demand estimates (all-samples mean/SD scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap with full historical sample set. This balances service level (covers (L+1) periods) while avoiding explicit overforecasting given no confirmed demand regime change.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent realized weekly demand has been higher and more variable than the small Jan samples (recent demands in history range ~40\u2013240, often ~100\u2013200). On-hand=0, in-transit=684 \u2014 ample pipeline stock (684 covers multiple weeks at recent demand rates) but visibility delayed by 1 period. Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent demand regime rather than the sparse Jan samples, set demand estimates using recent_N over the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current mean/variance). This balances service (using recent demand mean) and holding cost (pipeline already large), and lets the backend compute base_stock and the capped order amount accordingly.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=675. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has risen vs. the early sample set (last 5 period demands: P16-P20 = 240,116,94,127,434) indicating a higher recent mean and volatility. I set L using observed data (calculate) to ensure backend uses confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most recent regime (captures recent spike including the 434 demand). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer OR to a higher base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma captures uncertainty to balance service level vs holding cost given existing in-transit stock.

No clear sustained demand regime shift in recent weeks (demand volatile but not consistently higher/lower for 3+ periods). I therefore use observed lead-time averaging to reflect confirmed L=4 and keep demand estimates based on the full historical sample (no recent changepoint). These settings let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given the 4-period lead time while preserving service from the large pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=108, in-transit=630 \u2014 pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand but arrivals are observed with 1-period observation delay. No evidence of ongoing lost shipments since multiple past orders have concluded with 4-period lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of historical samples) and volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples) so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock calculation anchored to confirmed L=4 while balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Observed actual lead time repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history; current on-hand=134, in-transit=520 (sizable pipeline). To avoid overfitting recent volatile weeks while respecting OR engine assumptions, use promised lead time and population-based demand/volatility estimates so backend computes base-stock from long-run sample stats. This keeps service levels aligned with profit/holding tradeoff and avoids over-ordering given large pipeline and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=492, in-transit=258. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals across history). No new sustained demand regime shift detected. To reflect confirmed lead time, set L by calculating average observed lead times. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies the base-stock formula with the confirmed L; this balances service level given steady historical demand vs. holding cost.

Recent occasional zero arrivals appear intermittent but not yet a sustained new pattern. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample history; this is conservative given stable confirmed lead time and avoids overfitting short-term noise while the pipeline/inventory position is healthy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=393, in-transit=372. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving with W=4). Recent brief gaps (Periods 25-27 arrivals=0) were followed by later arrivals, so no persistent loss pattern currently confirmed. I select L=default (use promised 4) since observed lead time = promised and sufficient concluded evidence supports 4. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this balances service level with holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (backend uses these to set z*). Using defaults avoids overfitting recent noisy gaps while pipeline (372) + on-hand (393) currently provides coverage for upcoming periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=429, in-transit=312 (pipeline=741). Historical weekly sample mean ~106.4 (from provided samples); lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent single-period zero arrivals (Periods 26-27) are not yet a sustained new pattern. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this preserves the confirmed L=4 behavior and avoids overreacting to short/noisy arrival gaps while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Current on-hand=488, in-transit=176 (combined 664) \u2014 healthy cover vs recent weekly demand (typically ~40\u2013200, recent weeks 49,114). Historical concluded arrivals show a stable 4-period actual lead time across many observations; missing shipments earlier resumed and no sustained loss signal since Period 8. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead-time evidence rather than blind promised. Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default and sigma_hat default) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, yielding a balanced base-stock that reflects long-run demand while the backend\u2019s cap limits over-ordering. This choice keeps service high given confirmed L=4 while avoiding manual overforecasting during transient noise.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): recent weekly demand has been well above the small Jan sample set (most recent demands ~110\u2013434, current on-hand=444 + in-transit=220 provides coverage). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To make the forecast responsive to the recent higher-demand regime, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the latest 5 demand observations) while keeping L as default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded messages confirm LT=4 and no new LT loss pattern is evident.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=369 and in-transit=172 (total pipeline 541) provides substantial cover vs. week-level demand (historical samples mean ~106.4).

Earlier missing arrivals resolved into consistent 4-period LT. To align OR backend with observed reality I set L=calculate to use observed lead times. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, ensuring ordering targets cover the review+lead horizon (L+1) and balances service against $1 holding cost with $4 profit.

Given confirmed lead time and no strong recent changepoint, use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend's base-stock computation uses full-sample mean/variance (scaled by 1+L). This balances service (use confirmed L=4) while avoiding ad-hoc changes that could overreact to short-term noise; high on-hand + in-transit already provides coverage, so no recent_N or explicit adjustments are needed.

Pipeline + on-hand cover multiple weeks of demand so no emergency correction needed. I choose L="calculate" to let backend confirm observed lead time from concluded history; mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" to use full-sample demand statistics (no strong recent changepoint or seasonal signal requiring ad hoc adjustments). These settings balance service level (use observed LT) and holding cost (no upscaling of safety stock without evidence).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows stable 4-period actual lead time and no new sustained regime shifts in demand. On-hand=263, in-transit=367 (pipeline+on-hand sufficient for near-term coverage). Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep alignment with observed arrivals. Demand sample mean (historic seeds) ~106.4 wk; with L=4 the backend default (1+L)*mean yields a 5-week forecast ~532 units, and default volatility scales by sqrt(1+L). These default settings rely on the full-sample baseline and let the OR engine compute the capped order while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise or occasional missing arrivals.

On-hand=228 and in-transit=418 \u2192 pipeline total=646 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7mean weekly demand (~5\xd7106.4=532) so no emergency replenishment needed.

Period 40 (2019-11-11). Current inventory: on-hand=158, in-transit=468. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; earlier missing shipments resolved and arrivals continue to match 4-period lag. Given stable confirmed lead time and no recent sustained demand regime shift, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the full history. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost while relying on full-sample estimates rather than short-term noise.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=129, in-transit=458 \u2192 total pipeline=587 units which exceeds (1+L)\xd7mean historical weekly demand (~5\xd7106.4=532), so coverage is adequate. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (robust given limited sample set). This balances service level (using observed L) against holding cost by relying on historical mean/variance rather than overweighting short-term noise or risking lost-shipment adjustments without new evidence.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; recent arrivals match promised L=4. On-hand=188 + in-transit=450 = 638 units in pipeline, which provides substantial coverage vs. typical weekly demand (no recent sustained demand regime shift detected). No evidence of new lost shipments. Therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std\u2014this balances service level given stable LT and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=432. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods). Pipeline (432) likely covers upcoming (1+L) demand windows; to keep alignment with confirmed lead time and avoid overfitting to short-term noise, use promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full sample set. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) versus holding cost given current zero on-hand and substantial in-transit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=588 units which implies ~588/5=117.6 units per period over the review+lead horizon (L+1=5). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and sporadic holiday spike (Period 42 demand=328) but latest demand (Periods 43=89) has normalized. To avoid overreacting to a single spike while letting the OR engine use full historical demand statistics, I keep L at the promised/default and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This leverages confirmed lead time, keeps orders aligned with long-run demand estimates, and avoids creating excess holding cost from reacting to an isolated holiday surge. In-transit inventory (588) already provides substantial coverage; defaults let the OR cap/order logic adjust order sizes appropriately.

Actual lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; I will use the promised/default lead time. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the confirmed L=4 and lets the backend compute base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=14, in-transit=633 (large pipeline covering multiple lead cycles). Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean ~106.4. Given confirmed LT=4 and a healthy pipeline, use default estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This leans on long-run sample stats to stabilise orders (high pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk) while default safety sizing balances service level against $1 holding cost versus $4 profit.
