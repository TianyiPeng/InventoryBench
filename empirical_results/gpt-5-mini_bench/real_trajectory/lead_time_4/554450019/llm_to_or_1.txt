Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly history shows a single large spike (109 on 2019-02-04) after four moderate weeks (31\u201344). On-hand and in-transit are zero, promised lead time is 4. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1), keep promised lead time and use an EWMA demand forecast to give weight to the recent spike while avoiding overreaction to a single outlier. L set to promised (default). mu_hat set via EWMA with gamma=0.5 to moderately emphasize recent demand. sigma_hat left as default to use historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). No concluded arrivals or lost-shipment evidence; therefore no carry-over insight.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): recent demand shows a sharp upward shift (2019-02-04 demand=109; Period1 demand=112) versus prior January weekly levels (\u224836.5 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=128 (ordered Period1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time still applicable. To capture the apparent demand uptick while respecting limited sample size, set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to weight the most recent three weeks (captures the emerging higher-demand regime: 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04, 2019-02-11). This increases target base-stock to improve service during the spike while sigma_hat recent_N=3 reflects recent variability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=286 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time is 4 and only two periods have passed since orders were placed, so no concluded arrivals yet\u2014no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Historical weekly samples show variable demand with one recent spike (109) but limited data to confirm a sustained regime change. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current in-transit stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (Period1-3 conclude) = [112, 81, 52]; on-hand=0, in-transit=410 but no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) because insufficient concluded evidence of lead-time shift. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the latest demand regime (mean ~81.67/week); this yields (1+L)-scaled demand over the review+lead window and keeps safety sizing responsive to recent variance while acknowledging missing arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=519; no concluded arrivals in history (all past orders show arrived=0), so cannot reliably infer a lead-time change\u2014use promised lead time. Recent demand (periods 1-4 concludes: 112,81,52,79) is materially higher than the earlier historical sample mean (~51.0), indicating a sustained uptick across 4 periods. To capture the recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 samples (recent_N=4) so the OR engine sizes base stock and safety stock to the elevated mean and observed volatility; keep L at default to avoid overreacting to missing conclude messages (possible delayed/lost shipments).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: avg increased from 51.0 to 81.0 (+59%), sustained for 4 periods (Periods 1-4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=53, in-transit=391 (pipeline=444) which covers multiple future periods given L\u22484. Historical concluded arrival shows an order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5 -> observed lead_time=4, so use observed evidence. Demand has recently shifted up (carry-over notes: sustained +59% starting Period 1 across Periods 1-4); to capture the new regime I use recent samples for demand mean/volatility. Choices: L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4; mu_hat by 'recent_N' with N=4 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 4-period elevated regime; sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to improve service for the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma reflects recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). On-hand=133, in-transit=233 (total pipeline=366) which currently covers multiple weeks. Demand has been elevated ~mid-70s recently; to capture the sustained higher regime I use recent demand samples. Set L by calculation to lock in confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the most recent 6 demand observations (Periods 1-6) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while holding costs are low ($1/unit) relative to profit ($19/unit).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand (Periods 3-7): 52,79,75,78,89 \u2014 trend around 75\u201389 units; on-hand=168, in-transit=212 (sufficient cover vs. expected demand). Concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20133 arrived with lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) so actual lead time matches promised. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times (evidence = three observations = 4). Demand has a sustained higher regime vs. older samples; to capture recent demand level and variance I use recent_N with N=5 (last five demand periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. These parameters focus orders on the new higher demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs. profit=$19.

Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-4 all arrived with lead_time=4 \u2192 confirmed LT=4. Demand recent history (Periods 3-8 = 52,79,75,78,89,110) indicates a sustained higher-rate regime versus earlier samples; I use a recent-window to capture current mean/volatility. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Pipeline + on-hand covers several weeks but upcoming demand remains elevated vs. older baseline. I set L by calculation of observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand periods) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability (periods 4-9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand level and volatility, balancing service rate vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Lead time evidence: multiple concluded arrivals show orders placed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P7\u2192P11 => lead_time=4 confirmed. Inventory: on-hand=88, in-transit=330 -> pipeline=418. Demand recent pattern elevated vs earlier regime; last 5 concluded demands = [89,110,72,61,49], mean=76.2. To match confirmed L=4 and capture recent elevated demand, set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the latest regime. This balances high target service level (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples and accounting for substantial pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=85, in-transit=338. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders in P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P7->P11, P8->P12). Demand recent 8 concluded periods (P5-P12 = 75,78,89,110,72,61,49,47) show a downward trend from a higher regime but still provide the best recent signal. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to center forecasts on the most recent regime and capture recent volatility, which balances service level against holding costs given high profit/low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P7->P11, P8->P12).

Recent demands have fallen vs. earlier spike; I use a recent-N demand estimate to reflect the lower recent regime (last 5 periods) so the OR engine won't over-order. L uses promised lead time to match observed confirmations. sigma_hat left as default to reflect full-sample volatility for safety.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Current on-hand=197, in-transit=141. Historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 11-14 = 49,47,60,47) indicates a stable recent regime; I use the last 4 observations to capture the current demand level and volatility. Set L to promised/default (4) to align with confirmed lead time and OR expectations. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=4) so backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 demands, keeping responsiveness to the recently observed regime while avoiding overreaction to older samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand variability for safety stock sizing. These choices keep base stock sized to meet near-term demand spikes while limiting excess holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and in-transit units.

Demand shows recent regime uplift and week-to-week variability; use recent_N based estimates based on the last 8 demand observations (Periods 8\u201315) to capture current regime and variance.

Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=216, in-transit=120. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand shows early spike but not a sustained new regime beyond what is recorded. Using promised lead time (default) so OR backend aligns with confirmed LT=4; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all samples (base-case demand estimate: (1+L)*mean of samples) because no new, sustained demand regime warrants changing the demand estimate and current pipeline is ample to cover short-term demand. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given confirmed LT=4) and holding cost (current inventory already high).

Demand has been above the early-sample mean (carry-over noted a sustained regime shift to higher demand). To capture the recent regime, I set L by calculate (use observed lead times) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 demand observations, balancing service level versus holding cost given decent on-hand + pipeline coverage.

Recent weekly demand has moderated versus the early spike; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 14-19): 47,51,49,37,28,34 \u2014 I'll use a recent window to reflect the current lower regime. Set L to promised (default=4) consistent with confirmed evidence. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty to recent demand, balancing service (profit $19) against holding cost ($1) by reacting to the lower recent mean and reducing excess inventory buildup.

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods and recent concludes are consistent. Given high profit vs low holding cost (q\u22480.95) the OR engine's default base-stock with promised L=4 is appropriate; no manual shrink/expansion of demand estimate is needed. Using default methods lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples while avoiding extra ordering when on-hand + pipeline is already large.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=279, in-transit=91 -> pipeline total=370, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods demand using historical mean (1+4)*mean(samples)=5*51=255. Demand has shown a past regime increase earlier in the record but recent weekly demand has moderated; no new sustained changepoint detected. To respect confirmed lead time and the backend's baseline demand statistics, use default methods so the OR engine computes base_stock and caps from full-sample stats. This avoids overreacting to short recent dips while leveraging the confirmed L=4.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent weekly demand has settled to a lower regime: last 8 demands = [37,28,34,15,25,15,10,10] (Periods 17\u201324) vs earlier higher peaks. On-hand=275 and in-transit=94 provide ample coverage vs recent demand, but promised lead time remains 4 (confirmed historically). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=4. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 8 samples; this tightens targets vs the full-sample mean and reduces unnecessary ordering/holding while preserving service during the 4-period lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows stable confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals) and current on-hand=324, in-transit=34 (ample cover versus recent weekly demand ~30-80, recently trending lower ~10-25). To avoid unnecessary holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from full historical mean/variance with L=4. Defaults balance service level and holding cost given confirmed LT and no strong new demand regime.

LLM Rationale:

To balance service vs holding cost: keep promised lead time (default) so OR uses L=4; use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to weight recent low demand more while retaining some history; estimate sigma from the most recent 8 demand observations (recent_N) to reflect current lower volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=321, in-transit=16. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has been moderate (single-digit to low-double weekly in July-Aug). No new sustained demand regime change detected. Use promised lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed LT=4 and let backend compute demand across (1+L) review+lead using all samples (default mu_hat) and default volatility (default sigma_hat). This balances service (maintain ample on-hand given high current inventory) against holding cost.

Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=303, in-transit=33. Recent demand has settled lower (~10\u201325/week) since Period 19; to avoid overstock I focus forecasts on the recent regime. Use promised lead time (default=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent 10 demand observations (reduces influence of earlier high-demand regime and reflects current low variability), so the OR backend will target a base stock appropriate for the current lower-demand regime and limit excess holding cost.

To avoid excess holding while covering the (1+L)=5 period horizon, use L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=8 (last 8 observed demands show a lower regime), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-demand regime and keep orders conservative versus holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Current on-hand=262, in-transit=22; recent realized demand has fallen from early high-50/80s regime to low-20s per week (recent weeks: P24-P30 demands ~10-31, latest four: 20,23,21,31). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given high on-hand and low recent demand, I anchor demand forecast to the most recent regime. I use recent_N=8 to cover the recent low-demand window while smoothing short noise; same N for sigma to capture recent volatility. L kept at default (promised lead time=4) per confirmed history. These parameters reduce ordered quantity relative to long-run average, lowering holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent demand shows a large spike (Period 31 demand=177) so I choose a responsive demand forecast. Set L via calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time average (matches promised 4). Use EWMA_gamma for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to adapt toward recent increases while damping single-period spikes. Keep sigma_hat as default to avoid overreacting to one large demand observation. These choices balance service (respond to rising demand) against holding cost risk.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=10, in-transit=193. Promised lead time=4 and prior concludes confirm LT=4; no sustained new lead-time signal. Recent demand is variable with a one-period spike at Period 31 (177) but not sustained (Periods 30-32: 31,177,97). I use L=default to keep promised lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 28-32) to capture the latest regime including the recent spike while smoothing older data; this yields (1+L)-scaled recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to recent demand volatility while relying on confirmed LT=4 so the OR engine can size orders to balance service level (high profit/holding cost ratio) and holding cost risk.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods (matches promised). To let the OR engine use full historical demand sample and the confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (captures recent variability via history) vs holding cost while respecting observed LT=4 and the sizable in-transit volume.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=511 \u2014 significant pipeline present but nothing visible this period. Recent demand shows a clear, large spike beginning Period 31 (see Periods 31-34: 177,97,331,110) so I adapt forecasts to this new regime. Use promised lead time (default L=4). For demand level and volatility I use recent_N over the detected regime (Periods 31-34, N=4) so the OR engine bases base_stock on the recent high-demand samples and increases safety stock to avoid stockouts during the spike while balancing holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 31: avg demand Periods 27-30 = 23.75 vs Periods 31-34 = 178.75 (+652%), sustained for Periods 31-34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher starting Period 31 (week of 2019/9/9); last 5 demands = [177,97,331,110,102], mean=163.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline covering ~5 periods at recent mean). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 4) to match confirmed behavior and keep OR backend assumptions. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks, aligning target base-stock with the spike). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so variability is estimated from the same recent spike window. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock for the elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces the immediate order quantity risk of over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=141, in-transit=989. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed Periods 1->5 ... 8->12); use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a recent high-volatility, elevated regime starting Period 31 (Period 31-34 average jumped dramatically). I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (Periods 31-36: 177,97,331,110,102,52) so the OR backend's base-stock reflects current elevated mean and increased variability while limiting overreaction to single outliers. This balances high service-level value (profit $19 vs holding $1 => target quantile 0.95) with holding cost by using recent data rather than all-history averages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=267, in-transit=807. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent P1->P5 ... P33->P37). Demand regime: large spike starting Period 31 (Periods 31-34 avg >> prior). Recent demand remains elevated (Periods 31-37), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand weeks. Set L to calculated (use observed lead times) to lock in confirmed 4-period lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 31-37) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and elevated volatility, which increases base_stock to preserve service during the spike while in-transit coverage and cap limit excess ordering to control holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=313, in-transit=671; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple weeks given recent demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence. Demand showed a large spike around Periods 31-34 but recent realized demand (Periods 36-38 = 52, 56, 90) appears to have settled to a lower, more variable regime. I therefore use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using recent_N on the most recent 4 concluded demand observations to capture the post-spike regime. Sigma is set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent regime while avoiding overreaction to the earlier spike, and leverage current ample pipeline to limit unnecessary holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and there was a large demand spike in Periods 31-34, but current on-hand (620) + in-transit (315) = 935 units provides substantial cover vs typical weekly demand. To avoid excess holding cost while the OR engine uses historical stats, I keep the promised lead time and default demand estimates so orders are driven by the backend's pooled historical mean/variance rather than forcing extra replenishment now.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=891, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods and recent demand spike (Periods 31-34) is already recorded in carry-over. With high on-hand and no pipeline, no urgent replenishment inference; use default methods so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean (1+L) scaling. Profit/holding cost (19/1) implies very high target service level; default mu/sigma will let OR engine cap orders appropriately while avoiding unnecessary explicit increases given plentiful on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=856, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and recent demand has settled down after the large spike earlier. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand, use promised lead time (default). Forecast demand using the most recent stable low-demand regime (last 6 observed demand periods) so mu_hat reflects current lower weekly demand; match sigma to recent volatility over same window. These choices reduce additional arrivals while allowing the OR engine to compute a conservative base-stock that balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Current on-hand = 765, in-transit = 0 \u2014 inventory is very high and comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand. To avoid excess holding cost while respecting the OR backend's assumptions, use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the engine will compute base-stock from full-sample statistics and cap ordering. No explicit upward/downward adjustments are warranted given ample on-hand stock and no new sustained demand or lead-time signals since prior insights.

Recent demand has returned to moderate levels after the large spike in Periods 31-34. To balance service vs holding cost given large on-hand, keep promised lead time and base demand estimate focused on the recent regime: use recent_N=8 to capture the latest 8 demand observations (captures post-spike stabilization) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend reduces ordering compared with long-run mean. This avoids over-ordering while preserving service with confirmed L=4.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=729, in-transit=0; promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. Recent demand has returned to low/moderate levels after the large spike in Periods 31-34. To avoid over-ordering given very high on-hand, keep promised lead time (default). Use a recent_N demand forecast (N=8) to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable regime and reduce influence of the earlier spike. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (high profit per unit) against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history. Given high on-hand and no pipeline, use promised lead time and population-level demand estimates so OR backend caps orders conservatively and avoids excess holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4. To avoid overstock while reflecting very recent demand regime, keep promised lead time and base demand forecast on the most recent 6 periods (captures the late-Nov/Dec pattern including one high week). This reduces risk of large new receipts and lets the OR engine cap order given large on-hand inventory.
