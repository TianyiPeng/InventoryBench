Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=105. Recent observation: Period 1 demand = 112, well above the historical sample mean (~51) used by OR. OR recommendation = 125 (uses historical mean and L=4). Lead-time inference: no confirmed lead-time change (only Period 1 conclude available; arrived=0 is expected for L>=1). Demand view: one strong period (112) suggests a possible upward shift but is not yet sustained (carry-over rule requires \u22653 periods). Risk trade-offs: profit per unit = $19, holding=$1/period \u2192 high profit vs modest holding cost favors avoiding stockouts. Target policy: ensure pipeline + on-hand + new order reasonably cover expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods while not fully committing to a long-term regime shift. Using a cautious short-term uplift toward recent observed demand but not fully multiplying it by 5 (since single-period spike may be transient), I increase ordering above OR to reduce near-term stockout risk while limiting holding cost exposure. Calculation: OR=125 is too low given one-period demand=112 and zero on-hand; in-transit=105 covers only ~1 period at the recent rate. I choose order=350 units to raise total pipeline+order to 455, which is ~4.1\xd7 the recent single-period demand (still below the conservative 5\xd7 demand but materially reduces stockout risk). This balances profit opportunity vs holding cost and avoids recording a premature carry-over insight.",

OR recommended 146 using promised L and historical series, but that recommendation ignores current large on-hand. Ordering now would arrive in Period 50 (after 4 periods) and add holding cost for many periods while current on-hand already covers the next ~9 periods at recent rates (331 / 35.8 \u2248 9.2). Profit per unit ($19) is high, but incremental profit only realized if extra units are sold; extra units increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) and risk leftover post-holiday.
