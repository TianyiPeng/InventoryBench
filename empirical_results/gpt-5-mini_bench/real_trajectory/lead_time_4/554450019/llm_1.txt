Current date 2019-02-11 \u2014 shortly after the large observed sale on 2019-02-04. b) Demand regime: historical weekly demands: 2019-01-07:37, 01-14:31, 01-21:44, 01-28:34, 02-04:109. The 02-04 value is a large spike vs prior weeks (sample mean prior to spike \u224836). With only one high observation, it is insufficient to declare a sustained regime change. c) Lead time / orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals history is available, so assume promised lead time for planning but monitor future conclude messages for confirmation or losses. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because orders arrive after L periods and current period demand occurs after decision, we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of expected demand. Using the 5-week sample mean (37+31+44+34+109)/5 \u2248 51 units/week as a practical forecast balances the recent spike and prior baseline. e) Final order logic: Order to cover 5 periods \xd7 forecast \u2248 255 units. This aims to meet potential sustained higher demand while limiting excessive overstock given holding cost $1/unit/period and profit $19/unit. Monitor arrivals and future demand to adjust.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-16 (pre-holiday) could risk higher demand, but recent on-shelf sales show no sustained holiday spike. Demand analysis: recent concluded demands P41\u2013P44 = 35,91,22,14 \u2014 high variability with only one large week (P42) and three lower weeks; no confirmed upward regime (need 3+ sustained periods). Historical carry-over insights indicate multiple regime shifts earlier; latest confirmed regime is the elevated inventory response to P31\u2013P39 spike, but current realized demand is low. Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead time confirmed = 4 periods from past evidence; in-transit = 0; on-hand = 505 units. Inventory assessment: with 505 on-hand and no in-transit, expected service coverage >> typical recent demand (~20\u201360/wk). Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit \u2014 holding many extra units will erode objective but stockouts currently unlikely. Decision logic: do not order this period to avoid increasing holding costs and because pipeline/on-hand provides ample coverage given no sustained demand surge evidence.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period start 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). Historical recent demands show low weekly sales after the November replenishment: P43\u2013P45 = 22,14,16 (avg ~17). Earlier large spikes (P31\u2013P33 and P42) are episodic and already reflected in carry-over. Lead time: confirmed = 4 periods from prior concludes. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 489, in-transit = 0. Forecast & safety: expected short-term weekly demand \u224815\u201325; even with a modest Christmas uplift risk, one week of elevated demand is covered by on-hand stock. Cost tradeoff: Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 ordering now risks unnecessary additional holding cost and potential overstock since no in-transit replenishment is needed. Action: place no order this period to avoid extra holding cost while meeting expected demand from existing on-hand inventory.",

Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; no arrivals expected from past orders. Profit per unit = $19, holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 high on-hand means heavy holding cost if we add inventory. With on-hand covering many weeks of expected demand (470 / ~20 \u2248 23 weeks), placing an order risks large holding cost and lower net reward.
