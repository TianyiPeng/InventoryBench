Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent weekly demand samples: [73,48,65,94,49] (mean ~ 65.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown. Promised lead time used to avoid unsupported inference. Use default demand/volatility which applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples so the OR backend can compute base-stock and cap with full historical sample information while respecting the promised lead time and current zero inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=98 (ordered P1, arrived=0) and demand last observed period=63. No concluded arrivals showing actual lead time yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change; use promised lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all historical samples (no sustained changepoint detected). These settings let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost while accounting for the in-transit pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=192 (matches ordered 98+94), no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Recent two orders have not concluded but this is expected given promised lead time=4; no evidence to compute a different L. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimators so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service-level needs (cover L+1 periods) while avoiding overreaction to unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=290 (no concluded arrivals yet). Historical weekly samples mean=65.8 (n=5). Promised lead time=4 remains unconfirmed (no conclude messages to infer actual lead time). Use default lead time and demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean and variability: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps orders aligned with historical demand while waiting for arrival confirmations and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=390 (sum of Periods 1-4 orders). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; shipments may still be in-transit. Historical demand samples (73,48,65,94,49) give mean\u224865.8/week. I use the promised lead time (default) and default demand scaling so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this is conservative given no confirmed changepoint or arrivals and balances service level vs. holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1602.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized arrival shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 => observed lead time = 4, matching promised lead time. On-hand =13, in-transit=318 (matches outstanding orders from P2\u2013P5). Recent demand (Periods 1\u20135) averaged 79.2 units/week vs earlier sample mean 65.8 \u2014 a sustained higher-demand regime over 5 periods. To capture the confirmed lead time I choose L by calculation (observed lead times). To reflect the recent higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (use last 5 periods of demand) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and updated volatility. This balances higher service level to avoid stockouts given demonstrated higher demand while keeping variance estimated from the same recent window to limit overstocking risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift over Periods 1\u20135: recent avg demand = 79.2 vs earlier sample avg = 65.8 (+20%); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order P1 arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand elevated: Periods 1\u20135 average = 79.2 (carry-over). On-hand=25, in-transit=320 \u2014 pipeline is large so risk of holding cost, but confirmed observed lead times = 4 (arrivals from P1->P5 and P2->P6). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the detected higher-demand regime rather than diluting with older lower samples. Sigma is also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders to cover (1+L) periods at the new higher mean while the backend cap prevents excessive single-period receipts, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded demands (Periods 3\u20137) show a higher regime vs the older sample mean (evidence: observed arrivals confirm lead_time=4 for P1\u2013P3 orders). On-hand=69, in-transit=309 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand has risen; keep safety stock tuned to recent demand. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (observed W=4, so L=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (use last 5 concluded demand samples to compute forecast and volatility). This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) while limiting extra holding given substantial pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=75, in-transit=260 => pipeline=335 which roughly matches coverage target for (1+L) periods. Historical sample mean=65.8 (from provided 5 weekly samples). Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods) so no evidence of lost shipments. I choose L=calculate to let backend confirm observed average lead time from concluded data. I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical seed while the OR engine applies the capped order policy to balance profit vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=44, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; demand recent volatility but last 5 periods average ~74.4 which reflects the higher recent regime vs older base. Set L to be computed from observed lead times to lock in confirmed 4-period reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the most recent demand regime (Periods 5\u20139) and match sigma_hat to the same recent window so safety stock reflects current variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline uncertainty) against holding cost by concentrating on recent demand rather than older low samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5 historical samples) averages 65.8/week; recent running sales since arrivals show steady weekly demand in the 50\u201395 range. On-hand=89, in-transit=298 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I choose L via calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this keeps ordering conservative given ample pipeline while meeting service-level tradeoffs (profit vs holding).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Observed concluded history shows consistent lead times of 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P7 arrived after 4 periods) and current on-hand=113 + in-transit=240 provides large pipeline cover. Demand history (recent weeks) shows some variability but no new 3+ period sustained shift beyond previously noted regime; given ample pipeline I keep demand estimates at the backend defaults and use observed lead-time averaging for L to be conservative. Choices: L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4 from concludes; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current high inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=96, in-transit=248 \u2192 pipeline total=344 units. Historical concluded lead times all show 4 periods, so use calculated lead time=4. Recent demand regime (since Period 6) is the relevant regime; I use recent_N=7 (Periods 6\u201312) to capture the post-change mean/variance for the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility. This balances service (capture elevated recent mean) vs holding cost by targeting recent observed demand rather than older, lower samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=121, in-transit=205 (healthy pipeline). Historical conclude messages show consistent 4-period actual lead time and no lost shipments. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier surge; last 5 realized weekly demands = [57,51,63,68,68] (mean ~61.4). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=4 from concluded arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures the post-shift demand level and variability). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent lower mean while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost using profit/holding ratio.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201315) shows stable elevated weekly demand (~71 units/week) with confirmed lead time = 4 periods from multiple concluded arrivals. On-hand = 84, in-transit = 213 (pipeline total = 297) which is somewhat below the (1+L)-period demand requirement; no sustained new changepoint detected. Use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples)+safety and caps orders appropriately. This balances service (covering 5 periods of average demand) vs holding cost given steady demand and confirmed LT.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent on-hand=97 and in-transit=248 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand historically elevated vs earliest samples. Observed arrivals in concluded history consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders repeatedly arrived after 4 periods). No clear new sustained demand regime change beyond the previously recorded shift. I therefore set lead time inference to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat equal (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this balances service level versus holding cost given profit/holding cost and the confirmed L=4 while letting the OR engine apply its established cap logic to avoid excessive orders.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Current on-hand=80, in-transit=252 => pipeline total=332. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence, so use promised/default L. Recent demand (most recent 5 concluded demands: P13\u2013P17 = 68,66,67,46,67; mean=62.8) is slightly below earlier averages\u2014I use a recent_N forecast to reflect the latest regime and avoid overstock. With L=default (4), (1+L)=5 so recent_N mu_hat (N=5) yields a 5-period demand forecast (~314) which is covered by current pipeline (332). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run estimate. These choices balance service (cover immediate 5-period demand) while avoiding excess holding given the low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. On-hand=31, in-transit=260. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, etc.), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand appears elevated vs earliest samples and sustained across many periods; to capture the current regime use recent_N over the last 13 demand observations to form (1+L)-period forecast and volatility. This keeps service high given large in-transit exposure while limiting extra holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than the full older history.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-24: recent demand regime (Periods 6\u201319) is higher than the original sample mean (carry-over noted +20%); confirmed actual lead time = promised 4 in historical concludes. On-hand=79, in-transit=245 (pipeline healthy). To keep service high given high profit/higher stock value (q\u22480.95) and the sustained higher-demand regime, use promised L (default) and base mu/sigma on the recent regime. Selected mu_hat and sigma_hat = recent_N with N=14 (captures Periods 6\u201319 recent behavior) so the backend scales base-stock to the new mean and volatility while respecting the promised lead time and pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=143, in-transit=193 (total pipeline=336). Historical concludes show consistent lead time = 4 periods. Profit/holding implies very high service target (q\u22480.95). Recent demand shows a downward shift versus earlier periods, so I bias the forecast to recent data to avoid excess holding. Set L to promised (default) = 4 and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (N=8 includes the most recent two months of weekly demand). This keeps orders responsive to the recent decline while the high service-level q in the OR backend provides protection against stockouts.

Current inventory on-hand=125 and in-transit=211 (total pipeline+on-hand=336) provides ~5 periods cover at typical recent demand levels, so no urgent corrective action. No new sustained demand regime or lead-time change detected; use default aggregate demand estimates so the OR backend applies its usual base-stock calculation while respecting the promised L=4. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting the backend compute safety stock from full-sample stats rather than overreacting to short-term noise.

On-hand=172 + in-transit=178 gives strong pipeline coverage vs the lower recent demand; no overdue/lost-shipment signs (lead time has been consistently 4). I set L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed historically as 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the clear downward regime in the most recent 5 periods (captures current summer demand and lower variability), which will reduce order targets and holding cost while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows steady weekly demand (samples from Feb\u2013Feb/May) with no new sustained regime change since Period 6; historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=177 + in-transit=136 provides buffer vs recent weekly demands. I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history and the confirmed LT to balance service level (profit/$19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise or potential isolated lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has softened vs earlier periods: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 21-25) = [39,50,33,37,33], avg = 38.4. Current inventory is high: on-hand=144, in-transit=200 (pipeline=344). Historical concluded lead times remain consistently 4 periods. To avoid overstock during this lower-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base-stock to match the recent downturn; keep L at default (promised 4) since concluded evidence confirms it. No new sustained pattern beyond the recent demand drop, so no carry-over update.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent average demand higher than early sample (carry-over noted) but no new sustained changepoint since last insight. On-hand=189 + in-transit=111 => pipeline_inventory=300. Promised lead time is 4 and arrivals through Period 26 confirm reliable 4-period lead time. I choose L=default to keep the backend aligned with promised lead time (confirmed by history). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history \u2014 this leverages all observed demand data and the confirmed lead time to balance service level vs holding cost given high current on-hand+pipleine (300 units) relative to typical (\u224870\u201380/week) demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent realized lead times remain consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=4). Current on-hand=168 and in-transit=135 (total pipeline+on-hand=303), which already covers many weeks of typical demand and reduces need for aggressive replenishment. No sustained shift in demand mean/variance since prior carry-over insight. To avoid overstock given low holding cost relative to profit but already-large inventory, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR engine relies on its historical statistics and caps ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=119 + in-transit=203 = 322 units, which covers multiple weeks vs typical weekly demand seen in history. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (no sustained evidence of change), and some isolated zero-arrival periods reflect orders of zero or expected timing, not a confirmed shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this keeps parameters conservative given current healthy pipeline and avoids overreacting to occasional missing arrivals while balancing service level vs holding cost (profit=$19 vs holding=$1 favors reasonably high fill).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Current on-hand=137, in-transit=185; pipeline + on-hand adequate but demand regime has been higher since Period 6 (sustained). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead time to confirm reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (regime length ~24, capped to 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent elevated mean and volatility rather than older low-demand samples. This reduces stockouts under the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check.

No strong, sustained changepoint in demand in the most recent 6+ periods that would justify altering the demand forecast. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to let the OR engine balance service level and holding cost given current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=12, in-transit=206. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Recent demand has been elevated compared with earliest samples (carry-over insight recorded previously). To keep service during these recent higher-demand weeks while avoiding excessive over-ordering, I use the promised/default lead time (L=4) and a recent-N demand estimate to bias the base-stock toward recent demand levels. I choose recent_N for mu_hat to let the backend scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean (N=20 balances recency vs sample size). sigma_hat left as default to let the backend compute volatility from full sample history, giving a conservative safety-stock. This combination preserves service through observed 4-period lead time and responds to elevated recent demand without overreacting to single-week spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent weekly demand has been elevated (several weeks with 95,101,65) and on-hand=15 with large in-transit=226. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, so use promised/default L to match OR engine. To respond to the recent uptick I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to bias the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility toward the latest regime; this balances higher service needs vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/09/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=294. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has risen and been volatile; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29\u201333) = [46,95,101,65,114] -> recent mean ~84.2, higher than earlier sample means. To react to the recent higher demand while keeping the backend using its lead-time assumption, I keep L at default (promised=4) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to weight the most recent regime (captures the recent uptick and volatility). This balances service (reduce stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by shrinking the forecast window to recent data rather than all older, lower-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline (425) already covers multiple future periods (L+1=5) at typical demand levels, so no aggressive increase in forecast is needed. Profit/holding ratio implies very high service target (q\u22480.95); to avoid overreacting to recent noise and because lead time and demand regime have been stable since earlier confirmation, use defaults: L=promised, mu_hat=default (all-sample mean \xd7 (1+L)), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and stable lead time.

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, and pipeline is ample, so use promised/default lead time and demand estimates so the OR engine uses full historical statistics to set base stock. Using defaults (L, mu_hat, sigma_hat) lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given our large in-transit position.

I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to confirm 4; use default (all-sample) demand & volatility estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and balances profit vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline. No evidence of a new demand regime or additional lost shipments requiring an explicit change.

Demand has shown variability but no new sustained shift since prior insight. To avoid overreacting to recent noise and because pipeline is large, use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock with conservative safety stock: L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=176, in-transit=161. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Inventory is ample relative to recent demand, so use observed lead time. Use backend defaults for demand forecasting (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap given stable long-run samples and confirmed lead time. This balances service (profit/$19 vs hold $1) while avoiding overfitting to short recent noise.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weekly demand has been moderate (Periods 35-39 demands = 73,51,68,57,57; recent mean \u224861.2). On-hand=119 and in-transit=217 provide ample coverage vs expected demand; no new multi-period lead-time deviations observed (historic concludes consistently show 4). To keep the policy responsive to the most recent regime, I set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the last 5 weeks, balancing service vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1356.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand (Periods 31\u201340) averages ~74 units/week; no sustained changepoint detected vs. earlier history. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 when observed; no persistent lost-shipment pattern requiring an explicit L change. On-hand (88) + in-transit (176) = 264 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at current demand; therefore use defaults so backend uses promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. This balances service (keep availability) versus holding cost given ample pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=82 + in-transit=223 => pipeline=305 units. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods; no new sustained demand regime change detected since prior insight. To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and long history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use long-run mean) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=20, in-transit=241. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 confirmations). Recent demand has picked up (last 5 demands: 57,57,76,55,129) suggesting higher short-term mean and volatility ahead of holiday season. To capture confirmed LT=4 I use calculated average LT. To react to the recent uptick and elevated variance I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a higher base stock while limiting excess inventory risk via a short recent window.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent weekly demand has been around the low 70s (last 5 demands: 57,76,55,129,43 \u2192 avg \u224872) and on-hand=33 with in-transit=312. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. To keep the forecast responsive to recent demand (including the Nov spike of 129) I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend weights the last 5 weeks' mean and volatility when computing base stock and the cap. This balances service (protects against recent high demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=436. No new sustained changepoint since prior insight (Period 6 recorded). Promised lead time remains appropriate and historically confirmed as 4 periods; use default L to let backend use promised lead time. Demand shows irregular holiday spike (Period 42) but not a sustained regime change, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample). This keeps policy stable while the large in-transit pipeline (436 units) covers multiple review+lead periods, avoiding excessive ordering given holding cost sensitivity (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods; no new sustained demand regime change in recent concluded periods. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) we favor the backend's default estimates which use all samples and promised lead time to maintain high service while letting OR engine cap orders. Using defaults keeps behavior consistent with observed LT=4 and avoids overfitting to short-term noise.
