Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand: [30,27,70,72,56]. Recent 3 weeks (70,72,56) show a sustained higher regime vs earlier weeks. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher recent mean/volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service given equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg=66.0 vs overall avg=51.0 (+29%).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=81 (ordered P1). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence to change L. Historical samples show a demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3-week avg=66 vs overall mean=51. To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new regime while respecting promised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=162. Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed earlier have not concluded but are not overdue given promised L=4), so keep L as default. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift from 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg=66 vs overall avg=51, +29%); therefore set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher recent mean for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias stocking toward the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with the promise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent demand regime shift confirmed from earlier insight: last 3 historical weekly samples average 66 vs all-sample mean 51 (+29%). On-hand=0, in-transit=320; promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence to change L. To capture the recent higher demand I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the 70,72,56 regime). Keeping L as default ensures the OR backend uses the promised lead time while elevated mu_hat raises base-stock to improve service during the new higher-demand regime; recent sigma_hat reflects increased short-term volatility to set safety stock appropriately.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=481, past 4 conclude messages show zero arrivals (possible lost/delayed shipments). Historical demand shows confirmed regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg=66 vs overall avg=51). To avoid over-ordering while pipeline (481) is large, keep L at promised value so backend uses L=4; use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to reflect the higher recent demand regime; use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances raising the target stock for higher demand while not triggering extra orders given substantial in-transit inventory and suspected shipment issues.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg=66 vs overall avg=51). Concluded arrivals show an actual observed lead time of 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5), matching the promised lead time. On-hand=11 and in-transit=484 greatly exceed a 5-period demand forecast at the recent regime, so no aggressive uplift is needed. I set L using the observed data (calculate). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (uses the last 3 samples: 70,72,56). These parameters balance service (capture higher recent mean and volatility) while avoiding excess orders given large pipeline stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=4, in-transit=403. Concluded arrivals show orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived with lead_time=4 (Period5: ordered P1 arrived, lead_time 4; Period6: ordered P2 arrived, lead_time 4) \u2014 confirm actual lead time=4. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning 2019-01-21 (three-sample regime: 70,72,56). To capture this shift I set L by calculate (use observed lead times), and set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N with N=3 (focus on the confirmed higher-demand regime). This increases base_stock to cover the elevated (1+L)-period demand while sigma from recent samples reflects current volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=4 (three observations). On-hand=18, in-transit=255 -> large pipeline (273) covering multiple periods. Demand recent weeks elevated and variable (periods 3-7 demands: 111,92,70,88,144). To reflect recent regime and variability while acknowledging confirmed L=4, set L by calculation from observed lead times and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend emphasizes recent demand patterns while capping orders given large pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=35, in-transit=242. Historical concluded lead times from P5-P8 show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Recent demand has stepped up: last 3 realized demands (Periods 6-8) = 88, 144, 144 (avg 125.33) versus overall sample mean ~51. To capture the sustained higher demand and keep pipeline sufficient for the 4-period lead time, I set L by calculation of observed lead times and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across review+lead using the most recent high-demand regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the recent-window sizing to 3 periods (captures shift without overreacting).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6 (2019-03-18 to 2019-04-01): recent 3-period avg=125.33 vs prior overall avg\u224851.0 (+145%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 6 (sustained high weekly demand: P6=88, P7=144, P8=144, P9=136). On-hand=0, in-transit=337 (covers multiple weeks but arrivals shown in concludes confirm actual lead_time=4). I set L to observed average lead time to match confirmed arrivals. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime (changepoint at Period 6) using the last 4 observed demand periods to forecast (captures current elevated level). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to target a higher base-stock appropriate for the new regime while using observed lead-time to avoid underordering given past delayed visibility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 6 (demands P6\u2013P10 = 88,144,144,136,147; recent 5-period mean \u2248 131). On-hand=0, in-transit=510 (covers multiple future periods). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived P5\u2013P9), so use observed lead time. To capture the new, higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (regime length \u22485) so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock while L uses calculated observed lead time to reflect confirmed reality and avoid under-ordering despite past lost arrivals not evident now.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=649. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P7\u2192P11), so actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has jumped: last 3 concluded demands = 136, 147, 212 (avg=165), well above earlier averages. To capture the new high-demand regime and increased volatility, set L via calculate (lets backend infer observed lead time average), use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to base forecast on the most recent regime, and recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This prioritizes service during the sustained demand spike while the backend's capped policy limits excessive orders given holding cost. 

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P7\u2192P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 6 (2019-03-18) with 7 high-demand observations (Periods 6\u201312: 88,144,144,136,147,212,188). Lead time observations in concluded messages consistently equal 4 periods. To capture the higher recent demand while leveraging confirmed lead time, I set L via calculation of observed lead times and use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 7 demand samples. This biases orders toward the newer, higher-demand regime and keeps safety stock responsive to recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=47, in-transit=578. Historical concludes consistently show lead time=4 periods; recent demand has shifted up (last 3 demand samples: 212,188,132; recent 3-avg \u2248177). Reconcile: large pipeline already covers multiple periods but demand regime is higher \u2014 use calculated average lead time to reflect observed 4-period confirmation, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend upsizes base stock to the new higher-demand regime while capturing recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=66, in-transit=650. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21 with recent weeks substantially above historical mean. To target service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use recent demand to set forecast across review+lead (1+L=5). Set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 demand observations to capture the current elevated regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=22, in-transit=643; pipeline large so avoid overstating demand. Historical concludes consistently show 4-period deliveries; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Recent demand is elevated and variable (last 5 demands: P11\u2013P15 = 10,148,132,154,193? \u2014 but recent selling pattern shows sustained higher demand since Period 6). To capture the recent high-demand regime and higher variance, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (five most recent demand samples) so the OR backend focuses stock towards current demand while capping orders via its cap rule. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit variability) against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=681. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in prior insights). Recent demand has been elevated and rising: last 4 concluded demands = [132,154,193,223]; use a short recent window to capture this regime. Set L to promised (default=4) to match confirmed lead time. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=4 to target the current higher-demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough pipeline to cover (1+L) periods of demand while reflecting recent variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods and there is a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 6 (2019-03-18) that persisted for many periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=798 (large pipeline). I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded messages consistently show 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Period6\u2192Period17) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent average across the review+lead horizon and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while the OR cap and pipeline will limit over-ordering given the large in-transit stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=103, in-transit=580 (total pipeline=683) which comfortably covers multiple periods of elevated demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4; recent demand remains at the elevated regime (recent 8-period mean \u2248183 units/week vs earlier long-run mean \u224851). To keep service during this higher demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set lead time by calculation from observed lead times and forecast demand using the recent 8-week regime for both mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current demand conditions.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=55, in-transit=669. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history through Period 12). Recent demand (Periods 13-19: 132,154,193,223,218,142,190) shows a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (7 periods). To capture current demand regime I use recent_N based estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covers Periods 13-19). I keep L at default (promised lead time = 4) because actual lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4. These parameters increase forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to better balance service level against holding cost given the higher recent demand and large in-transit volume.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=79, in-transit=626. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply lead time = 4 periods. I select L via 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 4) so the OR engine uses observed lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples; this balances service level and holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit).

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while leveraging ample pipeline, I use default lead time (promised 4) and recent demand statistics over a multi-period window to reflect the new mean/volatility rather than the long-ago low-demand data. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by using a recent_N forecast that focuses the base-stock on the current regime.

To avoid overstock given high pipeline and holding cost = profit, use inferred L from observations and focus mu/sigma on the most recent low-demand regime. Choices: L: calculate (use observed lead times = 4). mu_hat: recent_N with N=3 to reflect last 3 concluded demands and avoid inflating orders from earlier spring spike. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=3 to estimate volatility from recent periods. This keeps base-stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime and limits extra ordering given already-large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=373, in-transit=315 (total pipeline+on-hand=688) which comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand; historical lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand shows multiple regime shifts earlier but recent weeks (Periods 17-24) reflect the current regime; therefore I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest 8 demand observations, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has fallen from earlier spring peaks to much lower summer weekly sales (last 6 demands: 190,104,79,88,61,44) and current inventory is high (on-hand 329 + in-transit 315). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while matching recent lower demand, keep promised lead time and set demand estimates using the most recent 6 periods to capture the summer regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history confirms promised lead time=4 and no new lead-time signals. On-hand=500, in-transit=78 (total pipeline=578) which far exceeds a (1+L)-period baseline demand estimate based on historical samples. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies the calibrated base-stock formula; this avoids placing replenishment while inventory is ample and minimizes holding cost risk.

To be responsive to recent lower/steady demand, set lead time by observed average and use recent_N=4 for demand forecast and volatility to focus on the latest regime. This keeps service while avoiding excess holding given $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Recent demand has declined from midsummer peaks; using a short recent window lets the OR backend lower target inventory to reduce holding cost while preserving service. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 26-28) and reduce excess buildup given high on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=471, in-transit=16. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in prior history). Recent demand has moderated from earlier peaks and current on-hand comfortably covers expected demand over the lead+review horizon. I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This avoids overreacting to recent short-term dips and leverages the confirmed LT=4; with high on-hand inventory little immediate ordering pressure exists and defaults balance service level vs holding cost.

Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in prior conclues. To avoid excess holding cost I forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current lower-demand regime and lower volatility: L kept as promised (default); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to downweight earlier high-demand seasons and reduce new receipts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=461, in-transit=70. Historical series shows a clear recent low-demand regime (Periods 27-32: demands = 50,39,18,16,3,7; recent avg \u224825.5) versus earlier higher-volume periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. Given high on-hand plus in-transit, I downweight long-run high-demand samples and use a recent-window forecast to avoid overstock while preserving service. I choose L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat based on recent N to capture the low-demand regime, and sigma_hat based on the same recent N to reflect current volatility. This keeps target base-stock modest and lets the OR cap limit large orders, reducing holding cost risk while still allowing replenishment if demand picks up.

Historical spring spike exists but current regime for the last 4 periods is a lower-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods previously, so use promised/default L to keep backend assumptions aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime (captures (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility) and avoid overordering given high on-hand stock and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in prior carry-over). Recent demand has settled low (weeks since Period 25 show single-digit to low-double weekly demand). On-hand = 486, in-transit = 0 \u2014 this inventory already covers many (1+L)=5 periods of expected demand, so no aggressive replenishment needed. Use default L to reflect promised lead time (which matches observed), default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend uses historical sample stats scaled by (1+L); this avoids over-ordering given high on-hand and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=483, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 4 periods; recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to low single-digit weekly demand in Sept\u2013Oct. I keep L at the promised/default (4) given confirmed history. I set mu_hat using recent_N=8 (captures the low recent demand regime: Periods 30\u201337) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and avoids over-ordering against earlier high-season spikes. sigma_hat left as default to let the backend use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination prioritizes avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been very low (Periods 25\u201338 average << earlier high-regime periods) while on-hand inventory is high (475) and in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. To avoid replenishing into excess stock I set L by calculation from observed lead times and use recent demand (most recent 14 weeks, the low-demand regime from P25\u2013P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a much smaller base stock aligned with current low demand. This reduces ordering and holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand is high (468) and in-transit is 0; recent weekly demand has been low (periods 31\u201339 demands mostly 3\u201322, avg \u22489). Historical data show a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and low recent demand, use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend uses full sample history; this keeps the OR policy conservative and caps ordering via its internal cap to limit excess inventory and holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has been low (periods 30-40 average \u224812\u201316 with last weeks 7,7,8,3,8,7,7), and on-hand inventory is high (461) with zero in-transit. Historical concludes consistently confirm lead time = 4. Given large on-hand and no overdue shipments, place no aggressive replenishment signal: use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so the OR backend will compute a conservative base-stock. Methods chosen: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default to use all-sample mean scaled by (1+L), sigma_hat=default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This minimizes unnecessary orders and holding cost while letting the backend set service level (q from profit/holding).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been low and stable since early Sep (Periods 30\u201341: 16,3,7,22,9,6,8,3,8,7,7,8) \u2014 a sustained low-demand regime. On-hand=453, in-transit=0 so inventory already covers multiple weeks; promised lead time=4 periods is confirmed historically. I set L to default (use promised 4). I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the recent low-demand regime, avoiding uplift from earlier high-demand months. This keeps the OR base-stock conservative to limit holding cost while meeting expected service for the current low-demand environment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=438, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show confirmed lead time = 4 periods and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (2019/9/2) with ~13 consecutive low-demand weeks. No overdue shipments currently. I set L to default (promised 4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L) forecast). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to reflect recent low volatility. These choices keep the backend base_stock aligned to the current low-demand regime while respecting the confirmed lead time and avoiding overstock given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=436, in-transit=0; profit=1, holding=1 so service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0). Historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since early Sept (Periods 31\u201343: demands = 3,7,22,9,6,8,3,8,7,7,8,15,2 \u2014 substantially below earlier peaks). I therefore set L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N over the low-demand regime to avoid inflating mu_hat from earlier high seasonal spikes: recent_N N=13 (Periods 31\u201343) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent low-demand regime. This keeps base_stock aligned to current low demand, avoids unnecessary holding cost given large on-hand, and lets the backend cap ordering via its cap rule.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=431, in-transit=0; recent weeks (Periods ~30\u201344) show a sustained low-demand regime (weekly demands mostly single- to low-double digits) versus earlier higher averages. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 4, so keep promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given current low-demand regime, set L to default (promised). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the recent low-demand regime (capture current mean/vol volatility). I choose N=16 to cover the most recent ~4 months of weekly data (sufficient to be stable but responsive). These parameters reduce target base stock relative to long-run averages and limit new receipts (pipeline=0) to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=425, in-transit=0. Historical record shows lead time consistently 4 periods. Recent weekly demand (since Sept) has remained in a low, stable regime; to avoid overstating demand before year-end, I use recent data for demand moments while letting lead-time be inferred from observations. L set to calculated average lead time (reflecting confirmed 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the low recent-demand regime ((1+L) scaling done by backend). This balances avoiding excess holding vs. preserving service with confirmed L and recent low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=425, in-transit=0, recent weekly demand has been very low (last 5 demands: 15,2,5,6,0) and holding cost equals profit so target service quantile is 0.5. No new evidence to change lead time (previously confirmed L=4). To avoid unnecessary receipts and holding cost, I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low recent demand ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and recent volatility; this keeps base stock modest and prevents new replenishment given large on-hand.
