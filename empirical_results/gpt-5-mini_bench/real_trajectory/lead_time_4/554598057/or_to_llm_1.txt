Recent 3-week average = 66 units/week vs earlier 2-week avg = 28.5 (\u2248+131%).

Demand coverage: (L+1)=5 periods of demand at ~66/week \u2248 330 units \u2014 in-transit=330 matches 5-period demand, so pipeline should cover the upcoming demand if shipments arrive as promised. Decision trade-off: profit = $1/unit sold and holding = $1/unit/period means critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock incentive; holding is costly relative to profit, so avoid creating excess ending inventory. Placing additional order now would mostly create future holding cost without increasing expected sales (pipeline already equals expected 5-period demand) and cannot prevent a stockout this period because arrivals from a new order cannot occur until after promised lead time.
