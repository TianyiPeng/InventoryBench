{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, holiday demand just passed). Product: men sweatshirt\u2014seasonal winter item, supports elevated demand in Autumn/Winter. Demand analysis: recent 5 realized weekly demands = [212,72,105,112,46], average \u2248109/week; more recent weeks (P44-P46) average = (105+112+46)/3 \u224888/week. Given volatility but overall elevated winter regime (previously flagged regime shift to ~91/week), forecast ~100 units/week as a reasonable midpoint. Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods; in-transit = 415 units that will arrive across upcoming periods. Decision rule: ensure on-hand + in-transit + new order cover L+1 = 5 weeks of forecast demand (5 * 100 = 500 units) because current period demand occurs after decision and arrivals occur only after 4 periods. Inventory position: on-hand 0 + in-transit 415 \u2192 short \u224885 units versus 5-week coverage target. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so avoid large excess inventory. Final order: 85 units to bring pipeline to ~500 units covering next 5 weeks while limiting holding risk.",
