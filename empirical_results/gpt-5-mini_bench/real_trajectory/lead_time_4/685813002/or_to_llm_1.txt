With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand after decision. Target coverage = 5 \xd7 100 = 500 units (conservative) which exceeds current pipeline (351) by 149 units.

Requirement: with L=4, cover (L+1)=5 future periods' demand. Demand outlook: recent regime = elevated (Periods 30\u201338 and later show weekly spikes; recent weeks show demand variability: P43\u2013P46 = 72,105,112,46). Using a conservative single-period demand estimate of ~80 units (consistent with the elevated regime average ~82.8 from carry-over), 5-period demand \u2248 400 units. Pipeline+on-hand (455) comfortably covers 5-period demand with modest buffer. Cost tradeoff: profit = $1 and holding = $1 per unit/period \u2192 high carrying cost discourages building inventory beyond needed coverage.
