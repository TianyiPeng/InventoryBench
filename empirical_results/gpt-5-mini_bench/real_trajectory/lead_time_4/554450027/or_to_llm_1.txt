Observation: Period 1 order (166) has not yet arrived (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), but this is only one concluded period\u2014insufficient to declare shipments lost or the actual lead time different from promised. Given demand ~131/week, (L+1)=5 period coverage target \u2248654 units; current pipeline 166 is far short, so we should replenish but respect OR's cap to avoid over-ordering volatility. Therefore place 165 units (rounded down from cap) to align with OR's capped baseline while accounting for current pipeline and demand profile.
