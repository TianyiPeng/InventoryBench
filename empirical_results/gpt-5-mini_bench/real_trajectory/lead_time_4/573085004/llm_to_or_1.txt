Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 573085004 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit. Historical samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show no sustained regime shift (5 weeks, mean ~157/week). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time or lost shipments. Use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent visible demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 157.2 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order of 193 arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be confirmed; shipments may be delayed but evidence is not yet sustained. On-hand=0, in-transit=193 which is well below the (1+L)\xd7mean demand (5\xd7157.2=786). I keep L at default (promised=4) and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine computes base-stock to cover the full review+lead demand and balances service level vs holding cost given the known profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded periods show no arrivals yet (orders placed but arrived=0), but in-transit=402 is visible; promised lead time is 4 and we have only two conclude messages\u2014insufficient evidence to change lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show stable mid-high demand; to let the OR engine use full sample history and promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This avoids overreacting to two periods of delayed concludes while covering (L+1) demand in the pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=668. Historical weekly demand samples: [168,172,173,123,150] (mean=157.2). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have concluded with arrived=0 but these orders are not yet past the promised 4-period lead time window so actual lead time/loss cannot be inferred. To avoid overfitting to unconfirmed delays and because demand history is limited and appears stationary, use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (using full-sample demand) against holding cost given modest holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=940 but no concluded arrivals in history; orders from P1\u2013P4 remain outstanding (likely delayed/lost). No observed lead-time confirmations, so keep L as promised. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20134) shows a sustained higher regime vs Jan samples: recent mean = 237.25 (4 samples) vs historical Jan mean ~157. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock to cover the higher, sustained demand over the review+lead window while respecting holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1\u20134 avg demand = 237.25 vs prior Jan avg ~157 (+51%); sustained for 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has shifted upwards: Periods 1\u20134 avg = 237.25 (confirmed in carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=1040. Promised L=4 was observed once (P1\u2192P5 arrival = 4), so use observed lead-time estimate. Use recent demand regime (last 4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the higher demand period; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline but still short of (1+L)\xd7recent mean) vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand elevated vs Jan baseline: recent periods (P1\u2013P6) show sustained higher weekly demand (~203\u2013283 range, avg \u2248 224). Lead time evidence: concluded arrivals show orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 and P2\u2192arrived P6 (observed lead_times = 4,4) so actual lead time confirmed at 4. Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=1044 (large pipeline). No overdue shipments currently. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the new, sustained higher-demand regime and avoid diluting the forecast with older Jan data. Sigma set recent_N (N=6) to capture current variability. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-period forecast rooted in the confirmed recent regime while acknowledging the large in-transit stock to avoid excessive additional ordering that would increase holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime in Periods 1\u20134 (avg 237.25) compared with prior Jan samples; more recent periods (P5\u2013P7) softened but not enough to overturn the earlier 4-period regime. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empirical 4-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N=4 window (Periods 1\u20134) to capture the sustained elevated regime when forming the (1+L) forecast; sigma_hat uses recent_N=4 to match variability in that confirmed regime. These choices supply the OR backend a forecast that protects service during the confirmed high-demand window while the calculated L prevents underordering due to earlier delayed arrivals. On-hand (145) + in-transit (905) is ample, but the base-stock approach needs the elevated mu_hat and matching sigma to avoid stockouts when those earlier high-demand weeks recur.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen from earlier spikes; last 4 periods (P5\u2013P8) average demand = 161. To reflect current demand regime while covering review+lead (1+L=5) periods and limit overstock, I use L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=4, and recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent 4 demand observations. This balances service level (covers 5 periods of recent demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent sales show a sustained higher-demand regime since Periods 1\u20134 (avg 237.25) vs prior Jan mean ~157. On-hand 550 + in-transit 340 = 890 units cover several periods at the new demand level; several past orders concluded on a 4-period lag. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm supplier behavior. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new regime (use the most recent 4 demand observations for (1+L)-period demand estimate). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices nudge the OR engine toward higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping caps in place to limit over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5; P2->P6; P3->P7; P4->P8; P5->P9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (confirmed P1->P5 ... P6->P10). On-hand=703, in-transit=127 (pipeline=830) \u2014 ample coverage versus recent low weekly demand (last 6 demands: 208,193,137,106,54,60). No new sustained demand regime or lead-time change since last carry-over insights. To let the OR engine use its full-sample demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes base-stock from all samples and the promised L=4; this avoids overfitting to short-term dips and leverages the confirmed historical lead-time pattern.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=786, in-transit=121; carry-over confirms actual lead time=4. Recent realized weekly demand since the regime shift (Periods 5\u201311 = 208,193,137,106,54,60,44) shows a clear downward trend from the post-shift peak; with high on-hand inventory I will rely on recent demand to set forecast so we avoid unnecessary ordering. Set L to default (promised=4, confirmed by observations). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 5\u201311) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant recent regime and reduces order quantity given falling demand and large on-hand stock. This balances high service target (profit/holding=>q=0.8) against the current risk of excessive holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized: last 5 concluded-period demands = [106,54,60,44,35] (avg ~59.8). On-hand = 751, in-transit = 121; recent arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 historically and no overdue shipments visible. To avoid overstock given low recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) but forecast using the recent 5-period demand regime. Set mu_hat with recent_N (N=5) to scale the (1+L) forecast to the current low-demand regime; set sigma_hat with recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces base-stock and limits excess holding while preserving service given confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg demand fell from 237.25 (Periods 1\u20134 regime) to 59.8 (Periods 8\u201312) \u2014 sustained for 5 periods (-74%).

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Inventory high on-hand=729 with in-transit=121; recent demand has fallen and stabilized since Period 8. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4. I set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 8\u201313) because a sustained low-demand regime is evident; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of those 6 recent samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices reduce orders to match the new low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while preserving serviceability given confirmed lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand regime (Periods 8\u201314) is low and stable after the earlier high-demand regime (changepoint at Period 8). On-hand (710) + in-transit (121)=831 >> expected (1+L)-period demand, so no aggressive upward adjustment needed. Set L by calculation (avg observed lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime (N=7 periods: Periods 8\u201314) so mu_hat reflects current lower mean scaled by (1+L). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the backend base-stock tuned to the new low-demand regime while acknowledging confirmed 4-period lead time and avoiding excess ordering/holding cost.

Current on-hand=812, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage versus low recent demand, so avoid aggressive replenishment. Choose L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed=4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the recent low-demand regime (Periods 8\u201315) so the OR engine targets lower base stock and reduces holding cost exposure.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand is high (799) with zero in-transit; no overdue arrivals visible. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime, I set L by calculating observed lead times (average of concluded lead times = 4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime (regime length = 9 periods, so N=9) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std, reducing orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given proven LT=4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 8 (sustained low weekly demand: recent samples 35,22,19,19,13,13...), on-hand is very high (786) and in-transit=0 with no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To avoid overstock while matching the current low-demand regime, set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N demand estimates using the last 10 periods (the sustained low-demand regime length). This keeps mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the low-demand regime so the OR backend will reduce orders and limit holding cost exposure.

Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand is very high (780) and in-transit=0, so we should use a demand estimate focused on the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess ordering and holding cost. Set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N across the most recent low-demand regime (N=11 periods covering Periods 8\u201318) so the OR base-stock and cap reflect the lower demand and lower variability, reducing new orders while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=768, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty and no imminent arrivals. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5 ... P11->P15).

To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L via calculated average of observed lead times, and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=12 (the 12 most recent concluded demand samples covering Periods 8\u201319) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the current low-demand regime.

On-hand is high (760) with zero in-transit; no overdue arrivals. I keep L as default (promised 4) given multiple concluded observations confirming LT=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the low-demand regime to avoid inflating mu_hat from the earlier high-demand spike (Periods 1\u20134). I choose N=14 (Periods 8\u201321 inclusive) since the low-demand regime is sustained for 14 periods; this gives the backend a (1+L)-scaled mean reflecting current low demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=14 to capture current volatility. These choices reduce ordering given high on-hand and the lower recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Lead times historically observed = 4 periods (consistent). To avoid excess ordering given large on-hand and confirmed low demand, set L by calculating observed lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=15) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and reduced volatility. This biases the OR base-stock downward to limit holding cost while maintaining service for expected low demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=649, in-transit=0. Recent history shows long stretch of arrivals matching promised L=4 earlier and then many periods with no orders arriving; no sustained new lead-time evidence beyond previously confirmed L=4. Demand has been low since Period 8 with one recent spike (109 in Period 23) \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. To be conservative I keep promised lead time and use default demand summaries so the OR backend uses all historical samples. This avoids overreacting to the single recent spike while ensuring the base-stock calculation accounts for the 1+L review+lead window.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=576, in-transit=16 (ordered P24, not yet concluded). Historical conclues show actual lead time=4 repeatedly; demand has been in a low regime since Period 8 with occasional spikes (recent demands P20\u2013P24 = [3,5,2,109,73]). To avoid overreacting to the single large spike, I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 weeks while capturing recent variability. This keeps orders conservative given high holding cost relative to profit and the large existing on-hand stock, and it prevents new large receipts that would inflate holding cost if the recent spike is transient.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=487, in-transit=16. Recent demand jumped starting Period 23 (109,73,89). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; no evidence of change. I use L=default to keep promised lead time=4. For demand I detect a changepoint at Period 23 and use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 23\u201325) so mu_hat reflects the new higher regime (captures the recent spike). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current volatility. This keeps orders sized to the new short-lived high-demand regime while avoiding inflating variance from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Periods 18\u201322 avg demand = 5.6 vs Periods 23\u201325 avg = 90.33 (+1509%), sustained for 3 periods (P23\u2013P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12): recent demand has jumped beginning Period 23 (demands P23\u2013P26 = 109,73,89,204). This defines a new high-demand regime starting Period 23 (regime length=4). On-hand=283, in-transit=16; promised lead time remains 4 and past concludes confirm LT=4. I set L=default to use promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (use the last 4 demand samples) so the OR backend builds base-stock and cap around the verified higher recent demand, balancing service (avoid stockouts during the new spike) against holding costs given ample on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime (Periods 23\u201327) is elevated (109,73,89,204,440) versus prior low regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=232 (includes orders placed P24 and P27). Promised lead time = 4 periods and historical concluded lead-times confirm 4, so use default L to match supplier promise. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime starting Period 23. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current higher demand while sigma_hat captures increased uncertainty; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 23 (109,73,89,204,440,414) \u2014 recent average = 221.5 over last 6 weeks. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 650 units. Promised lead time = 4 has been repeatedly confirmed historically; I'll use the promised lead time and base recent demand estimates to capture the new high-demand regime. Set L=default to keep lead time = promised 4, use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the six most recent observations. This ensures orders respond to the sustained high-demand regime while the OR engine's cap limits over-ordering against in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1145. Historical sample mean (provided) ~157.2/week; promised lead time=4 periods so review+lead =(1+L)=5 periods. In-transit (~1145) covers ~1145/5\u2248229 units/week \u2014 well above historical mean but recent periods show volatile spikes and stockouts; concluded lead times have consistently been 4 in history. To avoid overfitting to recent noisy spikes and because lead time evidence is stable, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (avoid lost sales given large pipeline) against holding costs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has moved to a high regime: Periods 26\u201330 demands = [204,440,414,329,457], so I anchor forecast on the most recent 5 periods. Promised lead time 4 is still supported by concluded history (multiple P->P+4 arrivals); use default promised L to keep OR backend assumptions aligned. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the large, sustained spike; with (1+L)=5 this covers the next 5 weeks. On-hand=0 and in-transit=1145 appears sufficient to cover the 5-period elevated demand but using recent samples prevents underordering if the spike persists. This balances high service (profit/holding -> high fill target) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* and cap from recent mean/volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1470 \u2014 large pipeline but demand has jumped recently. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect observed history. Recent demand regime change at Period 27 (sustained high demand); set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5, Periods 27\u201331) to capture the current high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend target a higher base-stock to meet the surge while the calculated L aligns ordering timing with observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg demand Periods 27\u201331 = 389.2 vs prior Periods 23\u201325 avg = 90.33 (+331%), sustained 5 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly; demand regime shifted up starting Period 27 (Periods 27\u201331 avg ~389) and remains the freshest regime. On-hand=275 + in-transit=1537 provides large pipeline cover vs (1+L) demand, but demand volatility recently is high. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=5, Periods 27\u201331) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated, volatile demand; this keeps base-stock responsive to the high-demand regime while the OR cap limits extreme orders and holding cost exposure.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has returned to a high regime (Periods 29\u201333 demands = 329,457,306,159,284; recent 5-avg = 307). Observed lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded P1->P5 ... P29->P33), so use inferred lead time. On-hand (486) + in-transit (1112) = 1598 units, which covers ~5 periods at the recent-5 mean (5\xd7307=1535). To align the OR backend with the current high-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding, set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the new regime and recent volatility).

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07).

To protect service during the elevated-demand regime and given profit $4 vs holding $1, keep promised lead time and base the forecast on the recent high-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the Periods 27\u201331 regime so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts during long lead times while accepting extra holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=806, in-transit=709. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201335) = [306,159,284,126,95], mean \u2248 194, showing a sustained higher-volatility regime since Period 27. To reflect recent demand regime while using confirmed promised lead time, set L=default (promised=4), mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock driven by current high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods; using recent stats reduces stockouts risk given confirmed L=4 and balances holding cost by relying on a short, recent window.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 27 (large weekly sales, avg ~269 across P27\u2013P36) and actual lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods. On-hand = 1228 + in-transit = 208 gives strong coverage vs near-term demand, so keep lead time as promised. Set L using default (promised=4). For demand forecast, use a recent_N estimate to capture the current high-demand regime; selected N=10 (Periods 27\u201336) to reflect the most recent 10 weeks where demand averaged ~269 and volatility is elevated\u2014this prevents underordering relative to older low-demand periods. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture current volatility. These parameters will bias the base-stock toward higher coverage for the observed high-demand regime while the OR backend's cap prevents extreme overshoots, balancing service level (profit$4 vs lost sales) against $1 holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has fallen from earlier spikes; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201337) = [126,95,79,80] showing a lower, stable regime (~95/week). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (consistent). On-hand = 1218 and in-transit = 320 provide large coverage vs recent demand; to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L using observed lead times and forecast demand from the most recent stable regime. Therefore: L=calculate (use observed lead time=4). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid inflating orders from older spikes. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to match short-run volatility. These settings reduce overordering from past spikes while keeping safety for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods consistently. To avoid adding inventory while holding costs accumulate, use the promised/default lead time and the backend's default demand estimates (which smooth across history); keep default volatility as well so the OR cap prevents large additional orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods and demand has been in a high regime since Period 27 (sustained elevated weekly sales). On-hand=1223 and in-transit=182 provide large coverage; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from P27\u2013P39, length 13) so mu_hat reflects the high-demand regime average over the last 13 samples and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to capture current volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding overstating demand from older low-demand periods, and they account for the substantial on-hand + pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand has been low: last 5 demands (Periods 36\u201340) = [79,80,67,66,26], mean = 63.6, indicating the current low-demand regime persists. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set L based on observed lead times and base demand/volatility on the recent 5 periods so the OR backend targets inventory appropriate for the low-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): on-hand=1360, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low compared with earlier spikes (last 5 observed demands: P37\u2013P41 = 80,67,66,26,19; mean=51.6). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Given large on-hand cover (\u22481360 units) and recent low demand regime, I set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets the current low-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to older high-demand spikes. This keeps base-stock conservative relative to observed low demand and limits additional incoming inventory (no in-transit currently).

Recent demand (Periods 36\u201342 = [79,80,67,66,26,19,83]) reflects the most recent regime; I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current lower-but-variable mean and volatility (N=7).

Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm LT=4; use default LT to align with supplier promise. To avoid overstock but remain responsive during potential holiday lift, set demand forecast using the most recent short-run regime: use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat captures current low-to-moderate demand (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean). Similarly use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock moderate. This balances high profit (>$4) vs $1 holding cost by relying on short recent demand rather than older high-demand spikes; large on-hand (1242) plus no pipeline means orders will likely be small or zero from the OR engine.

Promised lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history. Given very high on-hand inventory and zero pipeline, I will use the default lead-time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-data base-stock calc and the capped order prevents new receipts that would exacerbate holding costs.
