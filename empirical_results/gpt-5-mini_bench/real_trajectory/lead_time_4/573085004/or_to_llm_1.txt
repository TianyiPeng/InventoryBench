Promised lead time L=4; OR recommends 274 using historical mean demand (\u2248157.2/week) but OR ignores observed pipeline behavior. Lead-time inference: we have three concluded periods (P1\u2013P4) showing arrived=0 for orders placed in P1\u2013P3, so those 594 units remain in-transit and have not yet concluded; cannot assume they are lost yet because promised L=4 implies arrivals could still occur during Period 5 and only be visible in Period 6 conclude. Demand outlook: historical single-period mean \u2248157.2 \u2192 (L+1)=5 period demand \u2248786 units. Inventory posture: pipeline 594 < 786 shortfall \u2248192, but uncertainty is high because past orders have been delayed (no concluded arrivals). Decision trade-off: ordering now adds to uncertain pipeline and risks holding cost if delayed shipments later arrive; ordering the OR-recommended 274 would push total committed pipeline to 868, which would exceed 5-period expected demand if all in-transit eventually arrive, increasing holding cost. Given high uncertainty about whether in-transit shipments are merely delayed or will be lost\u2014and because we may observe arrivals during Period 5 (but cannot see them until Period 6 conclude)\u2014I choose to avoid adding more risk now and place 0 units.

Demand outlook: recent observed weekly demand has been low/moderate (Periods 40\u201345: 26,19,83,35,32,15 with recent 4-week average \u224835) and although earlier in-year spikes occurred, current recent regime shows much lower sustained demand. OR recommended 37 units based on historical means and promised lead time, but ordering adds holding cost $1/unit/period while marginal profit is $4/unit only when sold. With 815 on-hand and no pipeline, we already cover many future periods (\u226b (L+1)\xd7expected weekly demand). Therefore ordering now would likely increase holding-cost penalty without materially increasing sales. Final decision: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and allow on-hand to deplete toward normal operating levels. Monitoring: continue to watch concluded arrivals and demand; if demand spikes sustainably or on-hand drops near (L+1)\xd7forecast, resume ordering.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, so use L=4. Inventory: on-hand=802, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 41\u201346): 19,83,35,32,15,13 \u2014 average \u224833/week with high variability but most recent four weeks are low (35,32,15,13). OR recommends 38 units based on long-run stats and promised L; that baseline ignores current very large on-hand stock. Holding cost ($1/period) vs. profit ($4) makes excess inventory costly across remaining horizon. With 802 units on hand, expected near-term demand can be met many weeks without replenishment (802 / ~33 \u2248 24 weeks). No concluded arrivals are pending and no sustained new pattern warrants replenishment. Therefore order 0 to avoid holding costs and because pipeline + on-hand far exceed forecasted (L+1)-period demand.",
