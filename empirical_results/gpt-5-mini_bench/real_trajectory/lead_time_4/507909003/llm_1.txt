(c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals seen yet, so treat actual lead time as unknown and assume promised 4-period lead time for planning. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With lead time L=4, plan must cover L+1=5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). (e) Order logic: Use average weekly demand 86 as base, allow small positive adjustment for possible Valentine effect but remain conservative given limited evidence. Order = round(86 * 5) = 430 units to cover next 5 periods. This balances service level against holding cost given limited pipeline visibility.",

Forecast & order logic: use L+1=5 periods coverage (current period + next 4). Expected 5-period demand \u22485\xd752=260 units. In-transit (404) already exceeds this coverage; placing more will only raise holding costs ($1/unit/period) while profit per sale is $4. No evidence of a new sustained upward demand regime requiring extra stock. Therefore place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost.",
