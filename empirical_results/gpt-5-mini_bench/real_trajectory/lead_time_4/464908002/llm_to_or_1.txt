Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet (first conclude not available). Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean \u224858.4/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there is no evidence to override it. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (covers review+lead demand) against holding cost given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand samples (83,59,64,50,36) have mean 58.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=87 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded; promised lead time=4). No concluded arrivals observed, so actual lead time is unknown; treat lead time as promised. Use default demand stats scaled by (1+L) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap from full sample history. This balances service (use historical mean) vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change or shipment loss.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent historical weekly demand mean = 58.4 (samples: 83,59,64,50,36). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 would not conclude until Periods 6\u20137 under L=4), so no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and scaled volatility; this balances service level given profit/holding cost and current in-transit coverage.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=255. Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 show arrived=0) so no evidence to change L. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=58.4, but the last 3 concluded periods (P1..P3 demands = 32,40,42) show a sustained drop. I detect a recent demand regime (~3 periods) so I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the lower short-term mean and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This reduces replenishment targets vs. using the older higher mean, limiting holding costs while maintaining service for observed demand. In-transit (255) should cover much of the upcoming demand; using recent_N demand estimate prevents over-ordering given lower observed demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: historical mean 58.4 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) vs recent avg 38.0 (Periods P1..P3: 32,40,42), change -35%, sustained for 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=255 (orders from P1-P3 sum to 255) and promised lead time=4: these orders are not yet due to conclude (they will arrive during this period and be visible in Period 6), so do not treat as lost. Recent demand has a confirmed downward shift (recent P1\u2013P3 avg=38 vs historical mean=58.4); use recent data to set forecast. Choose L=default (use promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new lower-demand regime (uses last 3 observed demands), which reduces target base-stock and lowers holding cost while preserving service given current pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5). On-hand=63, in-transit=168 \u2014 pipeline ample but shipments previously delayed so we infer lead_time from concludes. Historical samples show a sustained demand downshift; use recent demand window to capture lower recent mean/volatility (N=3). L set to calculated observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect the new lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has shifted down vs historical: last 3 concluded demands (P4..P6)=40,24,33 (avg~32.33). On-hand=116, in-transit=82 (total pipeline=198). Two prior orders confirmed lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). To reflect sustained lower demand regime, set lead time by observed average and use a recent_N demand estimate (last 3 weeks) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand and sigma_hat captures recent variability. This keeps orders conservative vs historical mean while pipeline+on-hand currently covers the 5-period forecast.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=160, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders from P1..P3 each had lead_time=4 \u2192 confirmed actual lead time = 4. Demand has been lower than historical; use a recent-window forecast to reflect the sustained lower regime. Set L by calculate to lock in observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 observations (captures recent lowered demand while providing some smoothing). This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given long lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=116, in-transit=46; recent concluded lead times (P5-P7) confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand has been lower than historical (carry-over noted shift) but has shown a mild uptick in the last 5 concluded periods (demands: P4..P8 = 40,24,33,38,44). To balance service (profit $19) vs holding ($1), I use observed lead time calculation and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5-period regime to capture the new lower-but-rising demand pattern.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has settled lower than the 2019 historical mean but shows a modest rise over the last five weeks (demands: 24,33,38,44,49; avg\u224837.6). Observed concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders on P1..P3 arrived with W=4). I select L='calculate' to lock in the observed lead time average (evidence: arrived=87 from P1 at P5, 86 from P2 at P6, 82 from P3 at P7 => lead_time=4). For demand I choose recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent 5-week regime (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand but recent uptick; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating requirements from older high-demand samples while preserving service with confirmed lead time and current variability.

Recent demand has been rising over the last 6 concluded periods (24,33,38,44,49,53), so use an adaptive forecast (EWMA) to weight recent increases while retaining history. Use calculate for L to lock in observed lead time. Keep sigma as default to reflect full-sample volatility for safety given limited data.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=222. Historical concluded lead times (orders placed P1..P3 arrived P5..P7) confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has risen from the earlier low regime; using a recent-window forecast captures current uptick. Set L by calculation from observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 7\u201311) so the OR backend adapts stock to the recent higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods. In-transit 222 provides cushion vs. the new base-stock computed from these parameters.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand recovered since Period 5 (P5..P12 demands: 24,33,38,44,49,53,60,81) after the earlier low regime (P1..P3:32,40,42). On-hand=0, in-transit=229 (sufficient pipeline for several weeks). Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P3 and P8 arrived after 4 periods). I set L by calculate to let backend confirm observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (P5..P12) to capture the sustained post-changepoint higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias stock toward the revived demand while respecting ample in-transit inventory to limit excess holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

To respect observed lead time and let OR backend compute required review+lead demand using full historical sample set, I set L to calculated average of observed lead times and use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This leverages the confirmed LT=4 while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 (orders on P1..P3 arrived on P5..P7; multiple P8..P10 arrivals also show 4). On-hand 2 + in-transit 244 provides ample pipeline but recent demand has higher variability (recent demands: P12=81, P13=43, P14=55), so I use a recent_N=3 forecast to capture current regime and volatility. L set to calculate to confirm observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect the latest demand mean and std for the (1+L) review+lead period, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit/low hold cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=26, in-transit=260 (large pipeline). Historical sample mean 58.4 showed earlier dip, but the most recent 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 11-15 = 60,81,43,55,52) average ~58.2, indicating demand has rebounded to historical levels. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect current demand regime and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand samples (N=5). This keeps target stock aligned with recent observed demand while the large pipeline limits additional ordering risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=25, in-transit=265 -> healthy pipeline but demand history shows recent weekly demand ~50-60. Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P12 concluded with W=4). I set L via calculation to confirm observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 to weight the most recent regime (last 5 demands ~81,43,55,52,54 -> mean \u224857) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. Volatility likely changed with recent variability, so sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent std.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=238. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period gap (orders placed P1,P2,P3,P8,P9,P10,P11,P12,P13 arrived after 4 periods). Demand has been volatile with a single large spike (Period 17 demand=106) but not a sustained new regime beyond the previously recorded drop. I set L="calculate" to have the backend use the observed average lead time (confirmed 4 in history). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as "default" so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L), avoiding overreacting to the recent single spike while the long-run samples remain informative. This balances service level (use confirmed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: ordered P1 arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14, P11->P15, P12->P16, P13->P17).

Historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean=58.4 but an earlier detected regime shift to ~38 persisted P1..P3; however recent periods show large spikes (Periods 17\u201318 demand 106,139) and lead times repeatedly observed =4. To be conservative and let the OR engine use full sample statistics with confirmed lead time, I select L by calculation (use observed lead times), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This leverages the confirmed LT=4 while allowing the engine to balance service level vs holding cost given volatile recent demand and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent realized demand has risen sharply since Period 12 (demands P12..P19 = 81,43,55,52,54,106,139,84) indicating a new higher-demand regime of length 8. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To capture the recent upward shift I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend will size the (1+L)-period forecast to cover the new regime while keeping promised lead time (default). This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost given a high profit-to-hold cost ratio.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Lead time evidence from concluded history consistently shows arrivals 4 periods after order (many P->P+4 matches), so L is set based on observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 17-20 = 106,139,84,98) shows a clear, sustained upward regime for 4 periods versus prior recent average ~38. To react quickly, I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (captures the new high-demand regime) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Using calculate for L ensures the backend uses the confirmed 4-period actual lead time. These parameters raise the base stock to meet the higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock responsive and avoids excessive carrying beyond observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: recent avg (P17..P20)= (106+139+84+98)/4 = 106.75 vs prior recent avg 38.0 (P1..P3), change +181%, sustained 4 periods

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5). Use promised/default lead time (4) since calculate would match promised and concluded arrivals confirm L=4. This raises the (1+L)-period forecast and upstream safety stock to reduce stockouts while still using backend cap to limit over-ordering.

On-hand=0, in-transit=512 (pipeline large). I set L to default (promised 4) since observed and promised lead times match. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the most recent demand behavior (N=6 balances recency with sample size given sustained elevation). These parameters bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during sustained high demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent volatility so the OR engine sizes safety stock appropriately.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime is elevated since Period 17 (demands: P17..P23 = 106,139,84,98,112,114,107) vs historical pre-shift mean ~58.4; sustained increase starting Period 17/21. On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded history. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, taking N=7 (regime from P17..P23 length=7). For lead time I let the backend calculate the average observed lead time to confirm (will be ~4). These choices bias mu_hat up to cover (1+L) demand over review+lead given many overdue/high-demand periods while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 17 (P17..P24 showing large, sustained increases vs earlier baseline). On-hand=49, in-transit=474 provides healthy pipeline coverage. Promised lead time=4 is repeatedly confirmed by concluded arrivals. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=8 (P17..P24) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat focus on the new regime; keep L=default to use the promised (and empirically confirmed) 4-period lead time. This balances higher service level (capture increased demand) while relying on large in-transit stock to limit extra ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand regime: sustained high-demand from Period 17 onward (demands P17..P25 = 106,139,84,98,112,114,107,82,94) \u2014 a clear upward shift vs earlier low regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=101 and in-transit=399 (total pipeline 500) \u2014 ample coverage versus recent elevated demand but we keep forecast based on the new high-demand regime. Choices: set L by calculating observed lead times to lock to the confirmed value; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to reflect current mean and volatility (N=9 covers P17..P25). This guides the OR engine to raise base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat (recent) captures increased variability, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 17 and sustained through Periods 21-26 (recent demands: 112,114,107,82,94,61; avg \u224895). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=182 and in-transit=341 provide healthy pipeline cover, but demand remains elevated so use a recent-window forecast. Set L using calculated observed lead times (will be 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (last 6 periods) to capture the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime remains elevated since Period 21 (recent weekly demands ~106,139,84,98,107,82,94 \u2192 sustained higher mean). On-hand 222 + in-transit 269 gives 491 units; with promised lead time 4 (confirmed historically) and (1+L)=5 review window, pipeline comfortably covers near-term expected demand but we still use recent demand to size base stock to avoid stockouts if high demand persists. Set L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed confirmations). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-Period-21 high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility and keep service-level sizing appropriate while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P1->P5 .. P13->P17), so use promised/default lead time. Demand underwent a sustained regime shift upward starting Period 21 (P17..P28 show elevated weekly demand vs earlier regime). To capture the current high-demand regime, use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, taking N=12 (regime length since the shift ~12 periods), which balances responsiveness and statistical stability. This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. On-hand (247) + in-transit (227) are ample now, but parameters keep target stock aligned to the new higher demand while penalizing holding cost via the OR backend's q-ratio.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=247, in-transit=239. Historical lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned. Recent demand (Periods 26-29) = [61,60,61,71], showing a return to ~60-70 units after earlier spike; I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent regime and avoid over-ordering from older high-demand weeks. Volatility also set to recent_N N=4 to reflect current lower variability. This keeps base-stock driven by current demand while the large pipeline/on-hand (~486 total) prevents immediate shortages and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 17 (avg P17..P30 elevated vs early 2019). On-hand=270 + in-transit=155 -> pipeline 425 units, which covers several weeks of current demand but we must respect the elevated recent demand. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use calculated average to reflect observed confirmations. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=14 (covers Periods 17..30 regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and improve service while controlling holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (avg ~107 over P17..P20 and continued high thereafter). On-hand=255 + in-transit=240 => large pipeline (495 units) so avoid inflating long-run mean from early low-winter samples. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time has been consistently observed as 4. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=15 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime while smoothing short blips; this keeps base stock aligned to current demand and prevents excess holding given already-large pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded P->P+4 arrivals) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 (changepoint noted Period 21). On-hand=261, in-transit=231 (ample pipeline). I keep L at the promised/default (4) since arrivals confirm the promised lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-changepoint higher mean and volatility; I choose N=12 to span the clear higher-demand regime (roughly P21..P32 and surrounding periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand rather than older low-demand samples. This raises the base stock to maintain service during elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap rule to limit excess inventory and holding cost exposure.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand 288 + in-transit 148 provides ample coverage for (1+L) periods; to avoid excess holding cost while keeping service, use the backend defaults which use full-sample mean/STD with promised lead time=4 so the OR engine applies its cap and safety-stock logic.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Lead time history (many concluded arrivals) consistently shows 4 periods; demand exhibited a large regime shift around Period 21 but has moderated in recent weeks. On-hand=246, in-transit=148 (total pipeline high), so choose recent short-window demand estimate to avoid over-ordering. Set L to calculated (observed average lead time=4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the last 8 demand observations (P27..P34 mean ~54) so (1+L)\xd7recent mean captures current demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14): on-hand=307, in-transit=35. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in past concluded messages; no new delays. Recent demand (Periods 30-35 = 61,43,38,56,42,52) averages ~48.7, materially lower than the mid-year spike and sustained over 6 periods. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime, avoiding influence from the earlier high-demand spike. This keeps base stock moderate to balance high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) while avoiding overstock from past spike-driven orders.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=306, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals 4 periods after ordering (many P->P+4 observations), so actual lead time = 4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm this. With strong on-hand stock and no pipeline, use default demand/volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine produces base-stock reflecting full-sample demand while the large on-hand position cushions near-term service; this balances service vs holding cost given current inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P5..P37). Demand experienced a sharp regime shift upward around Period 17\u201321 and has since been elevated and more variable versus the original Jan sample. On-hand=258 + in-transit=103 provides ample coverage today, but with L=4 we must size review+lead demand based on the recent high-demand regime. I select L=default to preserve the confirmed promised lead time; use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short volatility; keep sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the backend cap and service-level math control order size given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): recent weekly demand (Periods 34-38) ~ {42,52,36,48,43} -> mean ~44.2. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). On-hand=215 + in-transit=204 = 419 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at recent demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate (captures the latest regime after earlier shifts) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. This balances service (use recent higher demand than early-year samples) while avoiding excess safety from older high-variance history.

[REGEX FALLBACK] Extracted: L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has cooled from the mid-year spike; last 4 observed demands = [36,48,43,29] (avg ~39). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in prior concludes. On-hand=186, in-transit=204 (healthy pipeline). To reflect current lower recent demand and avoid excess holding cost, set L to promised (default) and forecast based on the most recent 4 weeks. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current low-demand regime while respecting confirmed LT=4; this reduces target base stock and caps excess ordering given high on-hand + in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=161, in-transit=215. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead time=4; use 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time. Recent demand has softened vs mid-year spike \u2014 last 4 demands (P37..P40)=48,43,29,25, so I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the current lower regime. These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock aligned with confirmed LT=4 and recent demand while limiting excess inventory buildup given holding cost.

Lead-time history repeatedly confirms 4 periods; keep promised/default L to match backend assumptions. To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand and sustained low recent demand, forecast demand using the most recent short regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N N=4 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 4 demand samples. This reduces future order quantities vs using the long-run mean and protects profit by lowering holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has moderated (last few weeks: 10,38,25,25,29) after the large mid-year regime; on-hand 292 + in-transit 11 provides strong coverage against 4-period lead promise. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) \xb1 std scaling. This avoids overfitting to short low-demand blips while the pipeline is healthy and holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has fallen sharply into late Nov\u2013Dec (last 5 demands: 25,25,38,10,15; avg=22.6) while on-hand=288 and in-transit=86 (ample cover). Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost during this sustained low-demand season I use the promised lead time and base demand estimates from the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current regime. Chosen methods: L=default (promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture current low-season mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This down-weights the earlier high-summer regime and reduces order quantities given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal low-demand in Nov\u2013Dec confirmed: avg demand P40..P44 = 22.6 over 5 periods vs prior recent avg 106.75 (P17..P20); sustained decline for 5 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent data shows a sustained seasonal low in Nov\u2013Dec (Period 45 insight). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current inventory is high (on-hand 252, in-transit 86) while recent weekly demand is low (P40..P45 = 25,25,38,10,15,36). To avoid excess holding cost during this confirmed low-demand regime, I keep lead time estimation based on observed history and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent low-demand window (N=6) to let the OR backend compute a lower base-stock and cap, reducing ordering volume while preserving service level.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demands show a sustained Nov\u2013Dec low (Periods 42\u201346 demands = 38,10,15,36,29; avg=25.6 over 5 periods). On-hand=223 + in-transit=86 => pipeline=309, which comfortably covers the upcoming (1+L) demand (~5\xd725.6=128). Use L=default (promised 4) since observed lead time has been consistently 4 in history. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed seasonal low (regime length=5). Apply recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect reduced volatility in this low-demand regime. These choices reduce ordering to match lower seasonal demand and limit holding cost while preserving service.
