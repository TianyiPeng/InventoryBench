  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-02-11 \u2014 no major immediate event that strongly affects jeans demand (Valentine's Day on Feb 14 may modestly increase apparel browsing but not a strong driver for high-waist skinny jeans). Product: women's high-waist skinny denim \u2014 seasonal demand is relatively stable; not holiday-specific. Demand analysis: historical weekly samples for this SKU: 2019-01-07:557, 2019-01-14:438, 2019-01-21:489, 2019-01-28:500, 2019-02-04:649. Recent mean = 526.6 units/week; last week elevated at 649 suggesting slight uptick but not yet a sustained regime change. Lead time & pipeline: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals in history to contradict this. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: Because arrivals occur after the decision and demand will occur this period, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current + next 4). Using the recent mean ~527 units/week -> 5-period demand \u2248 2,633 units. Holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), so stocking to cover five periods is appropriate to avoid stockouts while we observe arrivals and actual lead-time behavior. Order placed now will be scheduled to arrive in ~4 periods (conclusion visible later); adjust in future periods as arrivals and demand confirm actual lead-time and demand regime.",
