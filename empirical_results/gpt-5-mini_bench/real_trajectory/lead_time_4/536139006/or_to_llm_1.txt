{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods from concluded messages (consistent arrivals). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=958 \u2014 with L+1=5 review+lead periods this pipeline alone covers well over expected demand (even at elevated Dec rates ~120\u2013165/week). Demand: recent weeks show elevated but volatile holiday demand; no new sustained regime shift (carry-over insights already record autumn spike). Costs: profit=$1 and holding=$1 per unit/period \u2014 holding large ending inventory is costly. OR recommends 0; given the very large in-transit position and symmetric profit/holding, I will place 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost and let pipeline arrive before ordering more.",
