  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 \u2014 holiday season just passed (Christmas) can cause earlier spikes and a post-holiday normalization. Lead time & pipeline: actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods (historical arrivals P1\u2192P5 etc.). Current on-hand = 36, in-transit = 326 (matches outstanding orders: P43 182, P44 120, P46 24). Those in-transit units will arrive in future periods (first large arrival during Period 47's arrival resolution but will be visible only in Period 48 conclude). Demand analysis: recent 7-period demand (P40\u2013P46) = [86,71,182,42,46,58,38], average \u2248 75/wk but dominated by a one-time spike (182) likely promotional/holiday; median/typical recent demand excluding spike \u2248 52/wk. Decision logic: with L=4 you must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using conservative forecast ~60/wk \u2192 5-period demand \u2248 300. Supply (on-hand + in-transit) = 362 > 300, so pipeline is sufficient. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory is costly. Risk of lost orders appears low (recent orders have consistently concluded at 4). Therefore do not place new replenishment this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and rely on incoming in-transit shipments to meet demand and re-evaluate next period once arrivals are observed.",
