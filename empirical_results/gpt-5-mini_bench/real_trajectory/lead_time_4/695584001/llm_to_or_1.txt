Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a clear upward shift (0,0,37,61,109) with the last 3 weeks averaging ~69 units. No arrivals/in-transit; promised lead time=4 and no observed lead-time evidence yet. To capture the recent regime, set L to default (use promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the recent higher mean and volatility over the last three samples, so the OR backend builds safety stock for the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg increased from 0 (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) to ~69 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=130 (ordered Period 1) which has not yet concluded; no confirmed lead-time change from concluded messages. Demand showed a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean across recent weeks). To capture the new higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (using the most recent 3 demand samples from the new regime) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the elevated regime while relying on advertised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (samples 37,61,109; mean\u224869). On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (large pipeline). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time. Profit=Holding => q=0.5 so OR will set base_stock\u2248mu_hat; to capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (regime N=3). This keeps target inventory aligned with the confirmed higher mean while acknowledging limited data and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) = {63,90,60} indicating a sustained elevated regime vs early zeros; on-hand=0, in-transit=379 which already provides substantial pipeline cover. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1-P3 arrived=0) so cannot confirm lead-time shift; use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Set L=default to keep backend's assumed lead time (promised=4). For demand, use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 3 periods: 63,90,60). Use sigma recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility of the same recent window. These choices focus ordering on the observed recent demand while relying on the large in-transit buffer and avoid assuming lost shipments without conclusive evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=379 (sum of prior orders). No concluded arrivals yet (expected visibility lag), so do not treat shipments as lost. Demand shows a sustained upward regime beginning 2019-01-21; recent realized weekly demands = [63, 90, 60, 57] plus earlier high observation (109). To capture the current higher regime while retaining some smoothing, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (uses last 5 samples). Keep L=default (use promised 4) because arrivals for early orders would only conclude next period, so no confirmed lead-time change yet. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the elevated recent demand while respecting the promised lead time and avoiding overreacting to unconfirmed shipment delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5). On-hand=82 + in-transit=249 provides ample coverage versus recent demand. Demand has shifted up since 2019-01-21; recent 5-period mean (Periods1-5 demands = 63,90,60,57,48 -> avg 63.6) is representative of the current regime. To keep service while limiting holding cost, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times), and base demand on the most recent 5 samples; volatility estimated from the same 5 samples so backend sizes safety stock to recent variability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has settled around 48\u201390 units/week (Period1-6 demands: 63,90,60,57,48,59). Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders on P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirms promised 4). For demand I use recent_N N=6 to focus the forecast on the six most recent demand observations (captures post-shift regime starting 2019-01-21). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service over holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each) and the confirmed 4-period lead time, helping the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while using recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period5; Period2 order arrived Period6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=198, in-transit=43. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods and demand has shifted up beginning 2019-01-21 (sustained higher demand). I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime across the available 7 concluded periods. I also use recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent higher mean while letting the backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=130, in-transit=125 (orders from P7=43 and P8=82), no new arrivals visible yet. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Demand rose starting 2019-01-21 and has been stable higher since (recent periods 3\u20138 avg \u224861 units). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding cost), set lead time by calculation (confirmed LT=4), use recent demand to capture the post-changepoint regime for mu_hat, and use recent variance for sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes safety stock to recent variability. This balances service vs holding given substantial on-hand but pending pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand regime established (post-2019-01-21) at ~60-75 units/week. On-hand=79, in-transit=175 (orders from Periods 7-9); confirmed lead time=4 from history. With Profit=Holding, critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0 so base_stock \u2248 mu_hat; to reflect recent regime I use recent_N=5 demand samples (Periods 5-9: 48,59,74,68,51) to forecast (1+L)-period demand. Using recent_N keeps forecast responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while recent_N for sigma captures current volatility. L chosen by calculation (observed lead times average 4) so backend aligns with observed lead time evidence and pipeline. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding (favor forecast median), and avoids over-ordering against earlier zero-demand periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent fulfilled demand has stabilized in the higher regime identified beginning 2019-01-21. On-hand=32 + in-transit=221 gives healthy pipeline but several recent orders (Periods 8-10) have not yet concluded; prior confirmed lead time=4. I set L to "calculate" to lock in observed lead-time evidence (uses average of observed concludes). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand observations: Periods 5-10 = 48,59,74,68,51,47) to reflect the post-changepoint regime and current volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the elevated mean while the OR cap limits over-ordering given holding cost equals profit. This balances service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline and confirmed L=4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand regime elevated since 2019-01-21 (historical samples and period demands: recent demands = [48,59,74,68,51,47,56]). Lead time has been observed = 4 in concluded history. On-hand=19, in-transit=215 (sufficient pipeline but watch for lost shipments). I set L by 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (captures the post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime shown above) so mu_hat =(1+L)*mean of last 7 samples; sigma_hat use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand regime (noted earlier) persists: recent 8 realized weekly demands (Periods 5\u201312) = [48,59,74,68,51,47,56,49], mean \u224857.3. Lead time observations from concluded messages consistently show 4 periods (orders on P1\u2192arrive P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12), so use observed lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=52, in-transit=187 \u2192 pipeline=239 units. With L=4 the (1+L)=5 period demand forecast \u22485\xd757.3\u2248286, so pipeline slightly short of target; setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 8 weeks centers forecasts on the current regime and lets the OR backend compute the capped order to restore base-stock while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand (Periods 8-13) shows stable weekly demand after earlier Jan regime shift: [68,51,47,56,49,27], recent mean ~49.7. On-hand 75 + in-transit 181 = 256, which roughly equals (1+L)*recent_mean (~248) so pipeline coverage is adequate. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; no evidence of lost shipments. I choose L based on observed lead times to ensure backend uses confirmed LT=4. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (last 6 weeks) to capture current lower post-spike regime; sigma uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent mean) against holding cost (avoids inflating mu by older high-demand samples).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed demand has settled below the early spike: last 8 concluded period demands = [48,59,74,68,51,47,56,49,27,22] (I focus on the most recent 8 non-outlier periods to capture current regime around spring). On-hand=99, in-transit=135 (total pipeline 234) which covers multiple weeks given recent weekly demand ~40\u201360; no new arrivals visible this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To balance service vs. holding cost (profit=holding= $1), I use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and a recent-window demand forecast to reflect the post-spike regime and recent softening. I select recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the recent demand pattern (reduces influence of the early large jump) so the backend computes base_stock that avoids excessive holding while preserving service level given substantial pipeline on-hand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=168, in-transit=57. Historical demand shows a sustained drop beginning Period 13 (2019-05-06) \u2014 recent 4 periods (P13\u2013P16) average demand is much lower than earlier weeks. Promised lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. To avoid overstock given the new low-demand regime, set L to default (promised=4) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflecting the lower recent demand. This balances avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 (2019-05-06): avg demand decreased from ~56.5 (Periods 5\u201312) to ~17.8 (Periods 13\u201316), a \u221268.6% decline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Current on-hand=200, in-transit=13. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 13 (demands for Periods 13\u201317 = 27,22,14,8,12; recent mean \u224816.6). To avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost, set lead time to calculated/observed and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the sustained downward regime and reduce forecasted inventory. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at W=4) and a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 13 (avg demand ~17.8 across Periods 13\u201316 and continuing low through Periods 17\u201318). On-hand = 192, in-transit = 13 \u2192 ample coverage; avoid additional inventory given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to target the post-changepoint regime (Periods 13\u201318) so mu_hat reflects the lower, sustained demand; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N N=6 to capture current variability. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service in the new lower-demand regime.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 13 (avg demand ~17.8 since P13). Pipeline is empty and inventory is already high vs recent demand, so we should avoid aggressive replenishment. Set L to promised (default=4). For demand and volatility use recent regime samples since the changepoint at P13: use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 13\u201319) to reflect the lower mean/variance. This reduces target base_stock and caps ordering to limit holding cost while maintaining service for current low-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=134, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.). Demand regime dropped around Period 13 (avg \u224817.8 since P13) but recent weeks include a one-off spike (Period 20 demand=53). To be conservative and responsive, set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (Periods 13\u201320) while allowing the OR engine to buffer for the recent spike.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand: last 8 periods show high variability with a recent spike (periods 18-21 demands = 8,18,53,77) after a prior low regime (Periods 13-16). On-hand=57, in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals expected; no overdue concluded arrivals beyond previously confirmed LT. Lead time is set to the empirically observed average (calculate) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=8) to capture the new higher/volatile short-run pattern rather than the older low regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect current volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to raise base stock to cover the recent spike while using updated volatility for safety stock, balancing profit vs holding cost given current on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=68 (order placed Period 22). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently. Recent demand has risen sharply in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 20\u201322: 53, 77, 109) after a prior low regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the persistent 4-period lead. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (covers the last 3 observed samples) so the OR backend places a higher base stock; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts during the recent spike) while the backend's cap limits extreme over-ordering; using recent samples also mitigates impact of older low-demand regime and accounts for possible missing shipments by relying on concluded lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg demand increased to ~79.7 (Periods 20\u201322 = 53,77,109) vs prior low ~17.8 (Periods 13\u201316), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward starting Period 20 (periods 20\u201323 demands = 53,77,109,173). On-hand=0, in-transit=194 (orders placed P22=68, P23=126) which will arrive with promised lead time. Lead time evidence: multiple concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Because a sustained high-demand regime (4 consecutive high periods) is present, I use a short recent window to capture the new mean/volatility. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to forecast over (1+L) review+lead horizon and to keep safety stock responsive to the new higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 updated: avg increased to ~103 (Periods 20\u201323 = 53,77,109,173) vs prior low ~17.8 (Periods 13\u201316).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand regime change at Period 20 produced higher demand (periods 20\u201324: 53,77,109,173,106). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Promised lead time = 4 and historical concluded lead times confirm 4. Choose L='default' to keep promised lead time (matches observed). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to focus forecast on the new high-demand regime (covers last 5 periods since changepoint). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture volatility in the new regime. This balances service (higher mean to avoid stockouts during spike) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has materially risen since Period 20 (series: 53,77,109,173,106,68 across Periods 20\u201325). On-hand=0, in-transit=518 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated average to capture that. Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the new high-demand regime (Period 20 changepoint, regime length=6), so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over these recent samples; this balances higher service needs from the stronger regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits additional ordering risk.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20 (demands P20\u2013P26 = 53,77,109,173,106,68,87; mean \u224896.1). On-hand=0, in-transit=450 (orders from Periods 23\u201325 =126+189+135) which will arrive during this period but are not yet visible. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 consistently. I keep L at the promised default (4) and use recent_N=7 for demand estimates (regime length = 7 periods since Period 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime; this balances service (avoid stockouts as large shipments are en route but not yet visible) against holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime since Period 20 is elevated and sustained (periods 20\u201327 demands = 53,77,109,173,106,68,87,91). On-hand = 35, in-transit = 355 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use calculated lead time. To capture the post-Period-20 high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (covers Periods 20\u201327). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; having large in-transit reduces order quantity via pipeline offset in the OR engine.

Forecast demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=9 periods since the Period-20 shift) so the OR engine targets service for the new higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding given high holding cost.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To match recent elevated demand while respecting observed LT=4, set L using calculated observations and forecast demand using the last 10 periods (captures the new regime).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent history shows lead time consistently observed = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). Demand shifted up at Period 20 and has been elevated through Periods 23\u201330 (demands: 173,106,68,87,91,88,89,71). On-hand=111, in-transit=289 provides substantial pipeline cover, but elevated recent demand warrants using a recent-sample forecast. Choices: L set by observed average (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time; mu_hat set to recent_N with N=8 to capture current high-demand regime (Periods 23\u201330); sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma captures increased variability for safety stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=84, in-transit=342. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Demand since Period 20 (2019-06-24) jumped to a higher regime and has persisted through Period 31 (12 periods: P20\u2013P31 = 53,77,109,173,106,68,87,91,88,89,71,58). To reflect confirmed lead time I keep L as default (promised=4). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N on the last 12 periods for both demand mean and volatility (N=12), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent regime and help the OR backend size orders to service elevated demand while balancing holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent weeks (Periods 30\u201332 demands = 71,58,55) show demand around ~61, lower than the mid-summer spike but above earliest lows. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use backend-calculated average to confirm but it will be ~4. I choose mu_hat using a recent_N window (N=8) to capture the most recent regime after the summer spike while smoothing week-to-week variability; sigma_hat left as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given sizable in-transit) vs holding cost by focusing forecast on recent realized demand rather than older high summer bursts. On-hand=117 and in-transit=274 provide ample pipeline, so no aggressive upshift is needed.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand 130 + in-transit 190 = 320 units in pipeline, which covers several upcoming periods at recent demand levels. I select L=default to keep promised lead time=4 (supported by numerous concluded arrivals), mu_hat=default to let backend use full-sample mean scaled by (1+L), and sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use all data given no new regime) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (~55\u201391 per week since Period 20), and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=147 + in-transit=104 gives 251 units in pipeline \u2014 covers multiple weeks of recent demand but we must keep safety stock given week-to-week volatility. I set L to default (promised 4) because observed lead time is stable at 4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (use last 8 demand samples) to make the forecast and volatility responsive to the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to one-off spikes. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding so critical to reflect recent mean and variability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Current on-hand=171, in-transit=118 \u2192 pipeline=289 units. Recent weekly demand ~60\u201377 (most recent weeks 60,69,71,55,58,71,69); pipeline + on-hand covers roughly 4+ weeks of demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. To avoid overfitting to short fluctuations and because lead time has been stable, use default (promised) lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full sample mean/variance. This balances service (we already hold ample inventory for ~4 weeks) against holding cost given profit=holding so no aggressive extra safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=108, in-transit=105. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). Recent demand regime is the post-Period20 higher-demand regime (sustained through Period36). To reflect the confirmed LT and recent demand level/volatility, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 20\u201336, N=17) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current demand, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility for the same window. This balances service (higher recent demand) versus holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; pipeline (in-transit=235) plus on-hand=11 is large relative to demand, but recent demand regime since Period 20 has been elevated and sustained. To respect observed LT evidence and focus forecast on the recent high-demand regime, I use calculated LT and recent_N demand estimates (N=12) to capture the most recent behavior while limiting noise. These parameters will keep base stock elevated to avoid stockouts given high recent demand, while sigma from recent data informs safety stock sizing to balance holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=336. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20 (sustained elevated weekly demand through Period 38). To keep service while avoiding excessive holding, use the promised/confirmed lead time and base mu/sigma on the recent post-change regime. L uses default (promised=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=19 (regime length from Period 20\u219238 = 19 weeks) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most relevant recent samples, balancing higher demand estimates with observed variability and the holding cost equal to profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=40, in-transit=311 (total pipeline=351). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P35\u2192P39), so I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend confirm average observed lead time=4. Demand has multiple regime shifts recorded in carry-over history; to avoid overfitting to recent volatility and because profit=holding ($1/$1) implies q=0.5, I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std. This keeps service-level conservative given large pipeline and avoids creating excessive additional inventory while preserving service.

Recent demand has varied but no sustained changepoint since previously recorded regime shifts. Using default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend blend long-run data with promised L; this avoids overreacting to short recent noise while the pipeline is large.

Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=103, in-transit=174 (pipeline=277) \u2014 ample coverage vs recent demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand (last ~8 concluded weeks) reflects the current seasonality/regime better than the full sample. With profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), we let backend center on a recent mean forecast while using default variability. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time=4; mu_hat based on recent_N (N=8) to capture the latest regime; sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use recent demand mean) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and there is substantial seasonality / regime variation across 2019. On-hand=149, in-transit=103 (pipeline=103) so pipeline + on-hand already covers several weeks; nonetheless recent months (Aug\u2013Nov) show higher, more volatile demand than early-year low regime. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (retain L=4) and forecast demand using a recent-window estimate to capture the current seasonal/regime level. I choose recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent 8 demand observations to reflect late-season demand and volatility) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will set a base stock appropriate for current demand while capping order size via its cap rule. This balances service (avoid stockouts in season) against holding cost given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and long history of stable LT and multiple demand regimes, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its long-run sample mean/variance across (1+L) periods.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent observed lead times from concluded arrivals are consistently 4 periods \u2014 no evidence of shift. On-hand=163, in-transit=92 gives sizable pipeline; recent demand (last 7 periods: 58,34,40,55,17,10,32) is lower and variable vs earlier high-season spikes. Set L by observed average to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (last 7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine reduces target stock vs long-run mean while still provisioning for short-term variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given pipeline uncertainty) and holding cost (avoid overstock from earlier high-demand regime).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=176, in-transit=62. Historical lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods; stick with promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks; the last 4 concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) = 17,10,32,17 (avg ~19) \u2014 I target the short recent regime to avoid excess holding given profit=holding ($1/$1). Set L=default to use promised 4, set mu_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and keep sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This reduces ordering given high on-hand while preserving service for near-term observed demand.
