  "rationale": "World & product: SKU is a hoodie (winter relevance) and date is 2019-02-11 (late winter) so demand is unlikely to drop sharply; no immediate calendar events to reduce demand. Historical demand (most recent 5 weekly samples: 45, 45, 110, 34, 50) gives mean \u224856.8 units/week. Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet so assume in-transit = 0 and use promised LT for planning. Decision rule: cover (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand to avoid stockouts while accounting for lead time and observation delay. Safety: given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), bias toward service (stocking) rather than under-ordering. Calculation: 5 * 56.8 \u2248 284; round to 285 units.
