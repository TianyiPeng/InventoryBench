{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Inventory: on-hand = 184, in-transit = 0. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 43\u201346) = {21, 28, 19, 16} \u2192 recent mean \u2248 21. Seasonal/context: Date = 2019-12-30 (end of December) \u2014 demand is low vs earlier-year peaks; no evidence of an imminent spike. OR recommended 81 using promised L and historical series; its base-stock logic (q=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock premium) would size orders to cover (L+1) periods of expected demand. With L=4, (L+1)=5 and recent-demand forecast 5\xd721\u2248105 units. We already hold 184 units on-hand, which comfortably covers the next (L+1) periods even under modest upside. Holding cost = $1 equals profit = $1, so excess inventory directly penalizes reward; therefore avoid adding inventory. Action: order 0 units. Decision: override OR's 81 down to 0 because on-hand >> expected demand over lead+review horizon and holding cost is high, so incremental ordering reduces total reward.",
