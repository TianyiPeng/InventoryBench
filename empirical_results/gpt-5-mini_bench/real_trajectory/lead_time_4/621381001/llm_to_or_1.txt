Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it, so use default promised L. Recent demand shows a sustained upward shift over the last 3 weekly samples (2019-01-21..2019-02-04 = 20,32,48). To capture this regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 samples so the OR engine stocks for the higher recent mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoiding stockouts given rising demand) against holding cost by not using the full-history mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3-week avg=33.33 vs prior 3-week avg=23.67 (+40.9%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=57 (ordered P1) but arrived=0 in P1 conclude \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is not confirmed; shipment may be delayed but not proven. Demand history (5 weekly samples) shows recent uptick recorded in carry-over. Given uncertainty in lead time and limited new conclues, use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock conservatively while the in-transit pipeline is considered by the engine.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=111. Historical weekly demand samples show a recent upward regime (noted earlier) \u2014 recent 3-week avg ~33.33. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 still not arrived), so keep promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for potential lost shipments. Set L=default (promised=4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed recent higher-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead period. Use sigma_hat=default to rely on full-sample volatility while preserving stability given limited new variance evidence. These choices increase target stock to meet higher recent demand while not overreacting to missing concludes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=192. Recent demand shows a confirmed regime shift: last 3 weeks mean ~33.33 (vs prior ~23.67, +41%). No concluded arrivals yet so do not change lead-time estimate. Use default lead time (promised=4) to let backend assume promised L; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent mean/volatility (weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and the safety stock to reduce stockouts while avoiding unwarranted lead-time inflation given lack of concluded delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=262 but no concluded arrivals from prior orders (Periods1-4), so cannot confirm lead-time change; treat promised lead time as default. Recent demand has clearly shifted higher (concluded demands: 48,65,48,43). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (avoid overcorrecting for possibly lost shipments). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 (the last 4 concluded demand observations) to capture the new, higher demand regime and its volatility; this raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and increases safety stock to balance service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost. Using recent_N=4 provides responsiveness while meeting the requirement to detect the sustained shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows an actual lead time of 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5) matching the promised LT. Demand has a recent higher regime (noted previously starting 2019-01-21). On-hand=21 and in-transit=205 (total pipeline=226) which currently covers ~5-week demand at recent rates; to avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost, I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the upward regime while letting the OR cap limit orders if pipeline suffices. Choices: L=calculate to confirm observed LT=4; mu_hat=recent_N (N=3) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 3 demand periods; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=3) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This approach reacts to the confirmed demand regime shift without overordering against existing large pipeline and accounts for confirmed lead-time behavior.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=33, in-transit=151 (total pipeline 184). Two conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders on P1 arrived P5; P2->P6). Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting 2019-01-21; recent regime contains 5 samples (2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04, Period5 2019-03-11, Period6 2019-03-18). I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the confirmed higher-demand regime; this keeps target base-stock responsive to the sustained increase while the large pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows actual lead times = 4 for three observed arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=52, in-transit=120 (includes recently ordered 50 from P7). Demand has risen vs earlier baseline (carry-over noted a regime shift starting 2019-01-21). To reflect confirmed lead time and higher recent demand, set L by calculation from observed lead times and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility to emphasize the upshift while keeping enough samples. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1), so we rely on recent demand rather than long-run mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period5; Period2->Period6; Period3->Period7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=78, in-transit=109 (pipeline=187). Historical concluded lead times confirm L=4. Recent demand samples show a higher post-2019-01-21 regime but only five historical weekly samples are available; pipeline well exceeds (1+L)-period demand forecast using historical mean. To be conservative and consistent with confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and default sigma. This balances service (high pipeline + safety) vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has risen: last 5 periods demands = [36,42,62,44,53], mean=47.4 (5-period total=237). On-hand 25 + in-transit 130 =155 < coverage needed for (1+L)=5 periods at recent mean (237) => pipeline currently insufficient. Lead-time has been consistently 4 in concluded history. I therefore set L based on calculated observed lead times and set demand forecast using recent_N=5 (captures the sustained higher-demand regime); sigma also set recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to recover service level while acknowledging holding cost via using recent sample volatility.

Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the higher recent demand regime and short-term variability while avoiding stale older samples. This focuses orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current demand level and limits excess holding given high holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand elevated vs early samples (confirmed regime shift starting 2019-01-21). On-hand=7, in-transit=180 \u2014 large pipeline exists and past concludes confirm lead time=4. Use promised lead time to match confirmed observations. For demand forecast use recent_N on last 5 actual demands (Periods 7-11: 62,44,53,41,43) to capture the higher recent mean; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 weeks so recent_N N=5 is appropriate. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a base stock aligned with current higher demand while the large in-transit stock prevents excessive ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=22, in-transit=177. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand uplift starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg ~33.3 vs prior ~23.7, +41%). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I set L based on observed lead times and bias demand estimates to the recent higher regime. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 3 samples reflect the uplift). This increases the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility for safety sizing.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods. On-hand=20, in-transit=171 (pipeline=191). Demand since arrivals began (Periods 5\u201313) shows elevated and variable weekly demand (36,42,62,44,53,41,43,44,23). I choose L by calculating observed lead time average to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N over the last 9 concluded demand samples (Periods 5\u201313) so mu_hat captures the post-arrival regime; similarly use recent_N N=9 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the OR base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean while using observed lead time to align replenishment timing and avoid stockouts given substantial in-transit inventory and past lost-order risk.

Recent demand has been moderate (last 5 demands: 41,43,44,23,36) so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime while smoothing noise. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) vs holding cost by relying on recent data rather than all-time mean.

Demand history shows earlier regime shift noted in carry-over but no new sustained change. I choose default L (use promised 4), default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend uses full-sample stats while respecting confirmed lead time and current healthy pipeline (103 in-transit) to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=55, in-transit=104 (pipeline total 159) which provides coverage vs expected demand. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 per prior insight, but no new sustained changepoint in the most recent periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with the promised/observed lead time and historical sample base, I use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples; this balances service level and holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has been elevated (last 3 demands: 39, 46, 69; recent mean=51.33) versus earlier history\u2014carry-over previously recorded the regime shift beginning 2019-01-21. On-hand=1, in-transit=136 (pipeline=137) which is below (1+L)-period demand if we assume recent rate. I set L to 'default' (use promised 4) since concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N N=3 to capture the current higher-demand regime and keep safety focused on recent volatility; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices push the OR backend to target service for the higher short-term demand while keeping holding exposure tied to recent variance.

Recent history shows frequent stockouts and high week-to-week demand, but available pipeline (211) exceeds a 5-period forecast based on historical sample mean (\u2248151 units), so we can rely on promised lead time and broad-sample demand estimate. Set L to default (use promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit buffer while allowing backend caps to limit excessive same-period orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated and volatile versus the small 2019-Jan sample; on-hand=21, in-transit=167 (pipeline ample for multiple weeks). No new lost-shipment signal; prior periods confirmed actual lead time=4. I select L='default' to trust the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Because demand regime shifted upward (noted starting 2019-01-21) and recent weeks show higher rates, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime. I choose N=7 (captures ~1.5 months of recent demand, between 3\u201320) to balance responsiveness and noise. These settings raise base-stock to reflect higher short-term mean while using recent volatility to set safety stock, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclude messages. To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap around the current higher mean and volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been substantially higher than the Jan baseline (sustained high demand in many recent weeks: demands in last 6 concluded periods ~[69,66,73,36,77,53], avg\u224860.7). On-hand=25 + in-transit=207 => pipeline=232 units. Promised lead time=4 was previously confirmed by arrivals; use promised lead time. Pipeline (232) vs expected upcoming demand: using a recent-period average (~60.7 per week) \xd7 (L+1=5) \u2192 ~304 units needed to cover current review+lead period, so pipeline is short. To raise target stock and reduce stockouts, set demand forecast using recent data. Therefore: L=default (use promised 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=6 (use last 6 demand observations) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, increasing orders to cover the higher recent demand and account for variability. No evidence of new lost shipments beyond earlier confirmation of L=4.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been elevated vs early-Jan baseline but no new 3+ period sustained changepoint since prior insights. On-hand=0, in-transit=245 units \u2014 pipeline substantially exceeds (1+L)-period demand under historical mean (~30.2/week), so no urgent additional safety. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use default lead time to keep alignment with supplier promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean/vol and caps orders; this avoids overreacting to short noisy swings while leveraging the confirmed L=4 and existing large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows sustained elevated demand since the changepoint noted starting 2019-01-21 and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=19, in-transit=172 provides healthy pipeline but demand remains high and variable; preserve service while avoiding excess holding. Set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability rather than diluting with older low-demand data. sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with current variation.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been high and volatile (Period 24-26 demands: 27,54,83) but on-hand (28) + in-transit (135) gives 163 units pipeline. Previously confirmed lead time = 4 periods. I choose to use the promised/default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the backend compute base-stock and capped order given the known pipeline. This keeps parameters consistent with confirmed LT and avoids overfitting short noisy bursts while the pipeline remains ample versus typical (L+1)-period demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has risen: last 5 realized weekly demands = [53, 27, 54, 83, 96], mean \u2248 62.6/week (uptrend vs longer-run). On-hand=12 + in-transit=127 = 139 units total pipeline; promised lead time = 4 periods (confirmed historically). I set L to default (use promised 4). To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast reflects the latest mean; I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to estimate recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while keeping volatility estimates tied to the same recent window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Recent demand has jumped: last 3 periods demands = 83, 96, 103 (avg=94) vs prior 3 periods avg=44.67 (+110%). On-hand=0, in-transit=235 units (pipeline appears large relative to historic mean but recent spike suggests higher demand). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised lead time. To react to the clear recent regime (3 periods), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while holding cost equals profit so service/holding tradeoff is balanced via the backend formula.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26 (2019-08-05): last 3-period avg=94 vs prior 3-period avg=44.67 (+110%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has jumped starting Period 26 and remained high (Period26-29 demands = 83,96,103,97). On-hand=0, in-transit=346 so pipeline is sizable but current on-hand zero risks stockouts this period. Promised lead time=4 and prior concludes confirm LT=4; I keep L=default to let backend use promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (the 4-period post-changepoint regime) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed from the recent high-demand samples; this raises target base-stock to reduce lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N reflects elevated volatility. This balances profit vs holding cost by basing stocking on the confirmed higher-demand regime rather than older low-demand history.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time remains 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 26 (period demands: P26=83, P27=96, P28=103, P29=97, P30=94) \u2014 recent 5-period mean \u224894.6. With profit=holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile is 0.5 (z\u22480), so target inventory should track the recent mean over the review+lead window. I set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps orders aligned to the new demand level while avoiding excessive holding from older low-demand data. No overdue shipments appear lost; pipeline (400) plus future orders will cover need but parameters should reflect elevated demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been in the higher regime confirmed starting Period 26 (avg \u224894 over recent weeks). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=5, in-transit=401 \u2014 ample pipeline but large demand suggests maintaining higher base-stock. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use most recent 3 weeks to forecast (1+L) demand and volatility), which raises the target base-stock to meet service while the capped order prevents excessive single-period receipts.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=50, in-transit=317. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand regime shift beginning Period 26 (sustained higher demand ~94/week) persists through recent periods; recent demand is materially above earlier history. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed by concluded arrivals). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (use last 7 concluded demand samples covering the new high-demand regime) so the base stock reflects the elevated (1+L)-period demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to capture the increased volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher target inventory to protect service during the sustained demand increase while keeping sigma estimated from the same recent window to avoid under- or over-stating safety stock given higher variability.

I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201333) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Volatility also set to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base-stock aligned to the new higher mean while using observed pipeline to avoid excessive additional ordering given large in-transit stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand remains in the higher regime that began around Period 26 (2019-08-05): recent demands (P26..P36) = [83,96,103,97,94,67,63,110,103,67,55] (11 samples). On-hand=32, in-transit=355 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To reflect the sustained demand uplift while avoiding overreaction, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend's base-stock and cap calculations use the current regime statistics while accounting for the (1+L) review+lead window and observed volatility. This balances service level (capture higher demand) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the higher regime established starting Period 26 (avg ~94 over recent weeks). On-hand=6, in-transit=331 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 consistently. To keep service while avoiding extra holding, use promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecast from recent high-demand regime. I choose recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-average volatility over the last several periods; this biases base stock up to meet elevated demand but the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering pressure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime confirmed around Period 26 (sustained higher weekly sales ~83\u2013110). Current inventory: on-hand=77, in-transit=284 (sufficient pipeline for several weeks). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I therefore use the promised/default lead time to keep alignment with supply expectations. For demand I focus on the most recent elevated regime (Period 26 onward) to avoid diluting the forecast with earlier lower-demand weeks; I choose recent_N with N=13 (Period26\u201338) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the elevated regime, improving service during this sustained higher-demand period while the large pipeline limits short-term stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-131.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weekly demand has cooled from the late-summer spike; last several weeks show lower, more variable demand than the Aug peak. On-hand=163, in-transit=219 => pipeline+on-hand=382 units, which covers multiple weeks at current demand rates so we can be cautious. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecast to the most recent regime (captures the recent lower average vs Aug spike). Volatility is also set using recent_N N=5 to reflect current short-term variability; this avoids overstocking for the summer spike. These settings balance service (using recent demand) against holding cost given high current inventory and healthy pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 26 onward (recorded previously). Current on-hand=174, in-transit=163 => pipeline_total=337, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand but we still must size forecast to the higher regime. Promised lead time remains 4 and has been repeatedly confirmed in concluded messages. I select L=default to use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=15) to capture the sustained post-Period-26 regime (15 most recent demand samples since the changepoint) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=15) captures recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data, balancing service level and holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has softened (last 5 period demands: 90,46,32,45,25) after the Aug high regime; on-hand=189, in-transit=170 (no obvious lost shipments). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overreacting to short recent dip while preserving service through the 4-period promise, use default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend smooths across the full history and balances equal profit/holding costs.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand (Periods 40-42 = 45, 25, 67) shows no sustained regime change. Current on-hand 192 + in-transit 100 = 292 units which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand under historical averages. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full historical mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to short noisy swings and balances service level vs holding cost given already-high inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 45,25,67,21,28) is lower than the mid-year spike; lead time has been consistently observed as 4. On-hand (196) + in-transit (51) = 247 units provide strong coverage vs recent demand. To avoid excess holding given Profit=Holding ($1 vs $1) I use the promised lead time and focus forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect current lower demand regime. This keeps base_stock aligned with short-run demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock from the service-level formula.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Historical data shows a sustained high-demand regime through Aug\u2013Oct then a clear decline in Nov\u2013Dec (recent demands: Periods 40\u201345 = [45,25,67,21,28,19], recent avg \u224834.2). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid adding inventory to an already-large on-hand (224) while matching current lower demand, keep L at promised (default) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 6 periods to reflect the post-peak lower regime. Using recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will steer orders toward current demand and reduce holding cost risk.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weekly demand has fallen (Periods 44-46 = 28, 19, 16; recent 3-avg = 21). On-hand = 208, in-transit = 4 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand = 212, which comfortably covers a 5-period (1+L) forecast (~105) so no urgent ordering. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4; no overdue/lost shipments currently. I set L=default to use promised lead time (consistent with observed confirmations). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the clear downward regime in the last 3 weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock targeted to current low demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service.
