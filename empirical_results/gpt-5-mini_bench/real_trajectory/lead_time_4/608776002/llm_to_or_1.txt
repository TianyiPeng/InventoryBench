Running full CSV horizon: 47 periods

Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). No on-hand or in-transit; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly samples (5 points) show mean ~229.4 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods and no evidence to contradict it. To give the OR backend stable inputs I use defaults: L = promised (4), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean (captures demand over review+lead), sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect aggregate volatility. This balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (weeks shown) mean = 229.4 units/week (196,255,294,212,190). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (ordered P1, not yet concluded \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time). Use promised/default lead time and demand estimates based on full-sample statistics: (1+L)*mean = 5*229.4 = 1147 for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)*std for sigma_hat (std\u224839.50 \u2192 sigma_hat\u224888.35). This keeps the OR backend anchored to historical demand while waiting for concluded arrivals to reveal any lead-time or regime shifts.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded periods show no arrivals yet but in-transit=599 (orders placed P1+P2). Historical weekly demand mean=229.4 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Promised L=4 remains plausible (no concluded lead-time evidence). I use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled std: this keeps forecast anchored to historical mean while the pipeline (599 units) is large relative to a single-week mean, avoiding unnecessary new orders while arrivals remain unconfirmed.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=900 (sum of prior orders). No concluded arrivals yet (all concluded arrivals=0), but promised lead time=4 has not yet produced any positive arrival observations\u2014no evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use defaults: let backend apply promised L and compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples to balance service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand samples (Periods1-4) = [233,271,174,145] show a weakening trend versus older Jan samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=1141 with four prior orders (P1-P4) not showing arrivals in concludes. This suggests shipment delays/loss risk; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly longer than promised to build pipeline cover. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures the observed drop). These choices raise target base-stock to protect service given uncertain arrivals while keeping variance estimates responsive to the recent decline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-4 (P1..P4) have not produced any arrivals in concludes (arrived=0 for each); sustained missing/delayed shipments across 4 periods\u2014possible lost shipments or extended lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-18. Historical weekly demand samples (196,255,294,212,190) give mean=229.4. Recent concludes show an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4); earlier missing arrivals resolved for that order, supporting actual lead time = 4. On-hand=141, in-transit=1138 so pipeline is large. I select L by calculate to lock in the observed lead time evidence, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages full-sample demand estimates and aligns base-stock targets with the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to transient missing-arrival noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical weekly demand samples mean=229.4 (196,255,294,212,190). On-hand=294, in-transit=842 => pipeline+on-hand=1,136 units, target coverage (1+L)*mean \u22481,147 (L\u22484) so we are ~11 units short. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). Use calculated L from observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality; use default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean from full sample since no sustained demand regime change detected. Default sigma gives backend the historical volatility scaled for review+lead period. This balances service (profit=holding cost) with minimal extra inventory given slight shortfall.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived Period 5; order on Period 2 arrived Period 6)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=460, in-transit=541 gives ample pipeline cover vs. historical weekly demand (~229.4 mean over samples). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand I use default (all-samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the stable historical baseline; sigma_hat default to capture observed volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep service high while avoiding excess deviation from historical demand given no new sustained regime change.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals for P1..P4). On-hand=519, in-transit=304 \u2014 no overdue or missing shipments now. Demand history (samples provided) shows mean \u2248229.4/week; with promised/confirmed L=4 I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock forecast tied to full review+lead coverage and leverages confirmed lead-time stability to avoid overreacting to short-term noise while balancing service vs holding cost (profit and holding cost equal, so backend will target a high service quantile automatically).

Use lead-time inference from concluded history (calculate) to lock L=4. Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) for mu_hat to reflect the full review+lead horizon and because no recent sustained demand regime change is evident. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to capture historical variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=695, in-transit=195. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). No sustained new lead-time degradation after that confirmation. Demand history (provided samples) yields a stable baseline. Profit = holding cost, so target service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0), making base_stock driven by forecasted demand over review+lead. I therefore use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times) and default demand/volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances fill rate without extra inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders on P1..P4 arrived on P5..P8; later confirms P8->P12). On-hand=567, in-transit=221; pipeline + on-hand comfortably exceeds (1+L)\xd7recent weekly mean so no urgent shortfall. I therefore set L to be computed from observed lead times (will reflect the confirmed 4). For demand I use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) because historical weekly samples (196,255,294,212,190; mean\u2248229.4) are limited but stable and align with recent sales\u2014this keeps the backend base-stock anchored to long-run mean while the OR cap will limit order sizes to control holding cost. Sigma left as default to reflect sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (profit and fill rate) versus holding cost given large current on-hand and confirmed L=4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P8\u2192P12, P9\u2192P13). Current inventory: on-hand=689, in-transit=97 (ample stock). Profit and holding costs equal ($1/$1) imply q=0.5 so service/holding tradeoff favors target near mean demand. I set L to be inferred from observations (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with high on-hand/pipeline this will limit new ordering and avoid excess holding while preserving service level under observed lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=612, in-transit=119 \u2014 ample coverage vs recent weekly demand (~229 mean across seed samples). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each) so service-level balancing favors default base-stock using full-sample stats. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and full-sample demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent weekly demand has fallen and stabilized well below the Jan seed samples: Periods 9\u201317 demands = [65,59,54,78,52,61,49,38,29], recent mean \u224853.9/week. On-hand=609 + in-transit=88 = 697 units \u2014 ample coverage vs (1+L)\xd7recent demand. Past missing shipments resolved and observed lead time = 4 in concluded history; using promised/default L is appropriate. To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new lower regime for both mean and volatility. Methods chosen: L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 (use last 9 weeks to compute (1+L)\xd7mean), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 (use last 9 weeks to compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps target base-stock aligned to the sustained lower demand and reduces unnecessary ordering/holding while preserving service given current large on-hand + pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg weekly demand fell from 229.4 (Jan seed) to 53.9 (Periods 9\u201317), a -76.5% sustained decrease (9 periods).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 9 (avg \u224853.9 over P9\u2013P17) and repeated confirmed actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=615, in-transit=68 (ample cover versus low demand). I set L=calculate so the backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (periods 9\u201317) to capture the new low-demand regime when computing mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the lower demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given the confirmed lead time and ample on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (recent weekly demand ~20\u201365, far below Jan seed). Current on-hand 625 + in-transit 33 >> weekly demand, so we should not inflate forecasts. Set L by calculating observed lead time (captures confirmed L=4). Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 9\u201317 and recent samples). This keeps orders modest to avoid holding cost while matching lowered demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently observed as 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift downwards (Periods 9\u201317 average fell ~76%). Current inventory is large: on-hand=633, in-transit=11. To avoid overstock while meeting lower steady demand, set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=9) to capture the post-change low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base_stock on the new low-demand regime and down-weight earlier high-demand samples, reducing unnecessary orders and holding cost given substantial on-hand stock and low current demand.

To avoid overstating demand from early high samples, set L to be calculated from observed lead times; set demand forecast and volatility using recent data to reflect the lower regime and limit replenishment.

To reflect the persistent low-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised=4) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (recent_N=9 covering P9\u2013P17). Use matching recent_N volatility to capture current variability. This keeps base-stock aligned with the new lower demand, minimizing holding cost while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=601, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1..P17 arrived after 4 periods). Demand has remained in the low regime since Period 9 (sustained drop; recent weekly demands ~12\u201317). To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and the low-demand regime, I use the promised/default lead time and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent demand regime (last 15 periods, Periods 9\u201323) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the current low-demand data. This avoids overstocking given high holding cost equal to profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (avg ~53.9) versus the Jan seed mean 229.4; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand = 573, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample stock vs current low demand, so forecast should rely on the recent low-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent low-demand regime samples (capture sustained lower mean/variance). This reduces overstocking and balances profit vs holding cost given high holding=$1/unit and low profit=$1/unit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=544, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple orders confirmed at lead_time=4). Demand experienced a sustained regime drop beginning Period 9 (lower weekly demand since then). To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and low recent demand, set L by calculating observed lead time, and set demand forecasts using the recent low-demand regime. L: calculate (uses observed lead times = 4). mu_hat: recent_N with N=17 to use demand from Periods 9\u201325 (captures the sustained low-demand regime). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=17 to reflect recent lower volatility. This reduces base-stock sizing to match current low-demand regime while the calculate L keeps lead-time accurate, balancing service vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=501, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly (orders in P1..P17 arriving after 4 periods). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 9; recent 9-week average demand \u224821.8 units/week (Periods 18\u201326). With high on-hand and low recent demand, set lead time to inferred average and base demand estimates on recent samples to avoid over-ordering. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=9 to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the most recent 9 weeks; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=9 to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the sustained low-demand regime while reflecting confirmed lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop beginning Period 9; recent weekly demand (Periods 19\u201327) averages ~26.7 units. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set lead time to promised (default=4) and base demand estimates using the last 9 observations (recent low-demand regime). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 to reflect the lower recent mean and volatility so the OR backend lowers replenishment targets accordingly.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=380, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has repeatedly matched promised 4 periods in concluded history; demand dropped sharply at Period 9 and has remained lower since (recent weekly demand mostly 14\u201363). To align ordering with the sustained low-demand regime while keeping service versus holding balanced (profit=holding), I set L=default to use promised lead time=4 and use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the stable low-demand regime (captures last 20 samples). This reduces excess ordering compared with using the full historical high-demand seed data.

Demand dropped sharply around Period 9 and has stayed at a lower regime since (recent weekly demand mostly 14\u201363). To reflect confirmed lead time I use calculate (average observed lead times = 4). To capture the new low-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the recent sustained lower mean/variance rather than the high Jan seed values. This reduces excess ordering and holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift down beginning Period 9 (avg fell from ~229 to ~53.9 for Periods 9\u201330). No recent arrivals in pipeline. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (use default=4) and set demand forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N on the last 20 demand observations to capture the lower sustained mean and recent variability. This reduces \u03bc\u0302 to reflect the lower-demand regime and lowers \u03c3\u0302 to reflect recent volatility, balancing profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=132, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many orders with lead_time=4 periods). Recent demand has risen vs the deep trough: last 10 periods (P22\u2013P31) average \u224850 units/week with acceleration in the last 4 weeks. Because lead time is confirmed at 4, set L via observed data. For demand forecast and volatility I use a recent-window (N=10) to capture the emerging regime while smoothing short spikes. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent upward trend) against holding cost (profit=holding so critical to avoid large overstocks).

Carry-over insight: Demand increase since Period 28: avg demand P28\u2013P31 = 77.75/week vs prior regime avg 53.9 (Periods 9\u201317) \u2192 +44% (sustained 4 weeks of higher demand).

Recent demand has increased since P28; last 5 weeks (P28\u2013P32) show higher average demand. Set L to 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time=4. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to make the forecast responsive to the recent upward demand regime while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window. This balances service (avoid stockouts given low on-hand and large in-transit) against holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand patterns.

On-hand=0, in-transit=246 \u2014 pipeline covers some demand but recent spike suggests higher short-term demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use calculated L to reflect observed lead times.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent history: on-hand=0, in-transit=535. Demand regime: long low-demand regime since P9 (avg ~53.9) but a sustained increase beginning P28 (P28\u2013P31 avg=77.75, +44%). Lead time evidence: multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Given confirmed L=4 and the recent upward demand regime starting at P28, I use lead time = default (promised 4) and set demand forecasts using the most recent short regime (to capture the higher post-P28 demand). Therefore: L: default to keep confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat: recent_N with N=4 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 weeks (captures P32\u2013P35 demand pattern); sigma_hat: recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the recent demand increase while the large in-transit quantity (535) reduces urgency and helps avoid over-ordering despite shipment uncertainty.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=915. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmed arrivals with W=4). Demand regime: large recent spike starting Period 32 (demands: P32=116, P33=319, P34=272, P35=315). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the new high-demand regime (weeks 32\u201335) so base-stock targets and caps respond to elevated demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data. This balances service (higher z*) against holding cost given profit=holding, and uses recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has trended up since Period 28 (notable spikes P32\u2013P36) but signal is still only ~9 weeks; on-hand=0, in-transit=1173 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently =4. I select L=calculate to use observed average lead time (matches promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the post-Period-28 higher regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the recent elevation while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has risen since Period 28: P32\u2013P37 demands = [116,319,272,315,275,345], recent mean \u2248 273.7/week (+~44% vs prior low regime). Actual lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=1032 (~3.8 weeks of recent demand) which is short of the (1+L)=5 period coverage target. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 4). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 6 weeks to reflect sustained increase). This prioritizes service during the demand uptick while the OR backend will cap ordering; using recent stats helps avoid understock given evidence of sustained higher demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=1080. Historical concludes consistently show 4-period actual lead time (orders arriving after 4 periods). Recent demand has stepped up starting around Period 32 (P32\u2013P38: 116,319,272,315,275,345,410) \u2014 clear higher-regime demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N window capturing the new high-demand regime (N=7 covers P32\u2013P38) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 7 samples. This biases orders upward to meet the elevated demand while the OR backend will cap order size; using recent_N reduces stockouts given the regime shift and avoids overstating long-term volatility.

Recent demand regime has risen since Period 28 (notable high weekly sales in P32\u2013P39, including very large spikes P33\u2013P39). To capture the recent higher demand and avoid stockouts while leveraging the confirmed lead time, set L to promised (4) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 8 weeks (covers the post-P28 higher-demand regime).

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new high-demand regime from Period 32\u201340; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. The large in-transit (1133) should cover multiple review+lead periods, so using the recent regime prevents over-ordering while maintaining service given higher demand.

Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (last 9 demand observations P33\u2013P41) to capture the recent higher and more volatile demand so the OR backend increases base-stock and safety stock appropriately given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=106 and in-transit=1521 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use observed average to set L. To react to the recent higher-demand regime and capture current variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (periods 39\u201343). This raises the (1+L) forecast and volatility so the OR backend increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts during this high-demand window, while the large pipeline limits new order size via the cap.

Recent demand has shifted up since Period 32 (sustained higher weekly sales through P44); to capture current elevated regime and holiday seasonality, set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 13 concluded weeks (P32\u2013P44). Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N=13 to reflect current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to the recent high-demand regime while using observed lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline inventory (on-hand 217, in-transit 1641).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history shows actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (many concluded arrivals at +4). Demand has been elevated since Period 28 with pronounced peaks in Oct\u2013Dec; current on-hand=225 and in-transit=1213 (total pipeline=1438) so supply is ample vs recent weekly demand. I set L=calculate to reflect observed lead time (backend will average observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to capture the higher post-P28 regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 18 samples). Sigma set to default so backend uses overall scaled std; given profit=holding the backend targets q=0.5 (z=0) and mu_hat will drive base-stock. This balances service (covering elevated seasonal demand) while letting large pipeline reduce additional ordering.

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 32 (sustained high weekly demand since then).

L set to calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed =4). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated recent demand while L=calculate lets the OR backend use observed lead time rather than default; these choices balance service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given very large in-transit stock.
