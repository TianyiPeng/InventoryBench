======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed = 4 periods (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand = 173, in-transit = 0. Recent demand trend: sustained low regime since Period 35; last 5 periods (P42\u2013P46) demands = [15,2,2,5,1], avg \u2248 5 units/period. With L+1 = 5 periods to cover, expected demand \u2248 25 units. Profit = holding cost ($1 = $1) so holding extra inventory yields no benefit versus marginal profit. OR recommends 144 (uses historical higher mean and promised L) which would greatly overstock given the confirmed low-demand regime and confirmed lead time. Action: place 0 units order to avoid unnecessary holding costs while current on-hand (173) comfortably covers the next (L+1) periods plus buffer for variability.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Override OR: order 0 units (OR=144) because on-hand 173 >> expected 5-period demand \u224825 and demand has been in a sustained low regime; holding costs equal profit so avoid restocking now.",
