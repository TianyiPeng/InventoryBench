Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04) show stable mean (~133.6) and no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments visible). Profit and holding cost are equal so critical fractile q=0.5. No sustained changepoint detected, so use promised lead time and default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute base stock and cap.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~133.6/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (order placed P1 showed arrived=0 in P1 conclude \u2014 consistent with promised lead time \u22651, not evidence to change promised L=4). I choose default methods: keep promised lead time (default) and let backend compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of all samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical weekly demand and avoids overreacting to a single delayed arrival while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical weekly demand mean=133.6 (samples: 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Two recent conclude messages show no arrivals yet for Periods 1-2 orders, but this is insufficient to confirm a lead-time shift (needs \u22653 periods). Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so OR backend applies its standard base-stock formula: L=default keeps promised lead time (4); mu_hat=default uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture baseline demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) so safety stock scales with observed variability. This balances service (use full historical mean over (1+L) periods) versus holding cost given equal profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive orders (P1=155, P2=157, P3=164) with arrived=0; on-hand=0 and in-transit=476. This indicates likely delayed or lost shipments (no concluded arrivals through Period 3). To be conservative I set lead time explicitly longer than promised to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults based on full historical samples (weekly mean ~133.6) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std accordingly. This balances higher safety against holding cost while the shipment reliability issue is unresolved. 

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (155,157,164 units) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 suggests lead time > promised 4 periods or lost shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly mean demand ~133.6, std ~12.74 from provided samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=650. Missing arrivals through Period 4 are noted but not yet conclusive vs. promised LT=4 (orders placed in P1 would only be visible at P5 conclude). To avoid overreacting to possibly-normal arrival timing, use promised lead time and baseline demand estimates. Therefore set L=default so backend uses promised 4; mu_hat=default to set (1+L)*mean based on full sample; sigma_hat=default to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding, yielding q=0.5 and moderate safety stock while preserving responsiveness if late arrivals are confirmed next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=15, in-transit=529. History shows Period1 order arrived in Period5 (lead_time=4), while orders from Periods 2-4 remain in-transit. Promised lead time is 4; observed arrival confirms at least one 4-period lead time, so use aggregate/default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base stock. Chosen L method = calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period observation). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples), providing conservative replenishment given pipeline inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (pipeline present). Demand recently shifted up vs. historical Jan samples, so I use recent demand stats to capture the new regime (reduce stockouts) while keeping lead-time estimate computed from observations. Choices: L=calculate to lock in observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 2-6) reflecting the higher recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a larger base-stock aligned to the sustained higher demand while acknowledging the confirmed 4-period lead time and existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: avg demand moved from 133.6 (historical Jan samples mean) to 155.2 (Periods 2-6 mean) = +16% (Periods 2-6: 156,170,135,140,175).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted upward since Period 2 (samples P2-P7: 156,170,135,140,175,173; regime length=6) versus earlier Jan mean (~133.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=534 (covers multiple pending orders; recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed consistent 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use last 6 periods) so the OR engine raises the base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This balances service and holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and significant in-transit stock already present.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has shifted higher since Period 2 (Periods 2-8 mean \u2248156.4) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Current on-hand=28, in-transit=547 (ample pipeline). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 2-8) to capture the sustained higher regime; mu_hat will therefore reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 7 demand samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the new higher-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding under/overstock given large pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). On-hand=64, in-transit=613 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand but recent weekly demand has softened (last 5 demands: 175,173,146,111,77). I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent downward shift; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend\u2019s base-stock responsive to the recent drop while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding excess holding given high holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=98, in-transit=433. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals matching orders placed 4 periods prior). Demand regime increased starting Period 2 (Periods 2\u201311 demand series: 156,170,135,140,175,173,146,111,77,151 -> higher mean vs Jan baseline). To reflect confirmed lead time I use calculated L (average observed lead times = 4). To capture the sustained post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (Periods 2\u201311) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the recent regime. These parameters align inventory targets with the higher demand while preserving the OR engine's service-level vs holding-cost tradeoff.

Period 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=171, in-transit=432; recent concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from P1-P8 all arrived with 4-period lag). Demand regime elevated since Period 2 (carry-over evidence), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher mean and recent variability. Set L by calculate to confirm observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (Periods 2-8 inclusive) so the OR engine raises base stock to meet higher demand while accounting for recent variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=258, in-transit=322. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (consistent P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so keep promised lead time. Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2 (Periods 2-6 mean \u2248155.2, ~+16% vs earlier); I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture that higher regime while avoiding older low-Jan samples. Chosen methods: L=default to align with confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) using the most recent higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=216, in-transit=265. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P10 all arrived with 4-period lag). Demand has elevated versus the very early Jan baseline (carry-over notes record a +16% shift starting P2). Given confirmed LT=4 and a sustained higher demand regime, use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so it balances service level vs holding cost using the profit/holding cost ratio. This avoids overfitting recent noise while reflecting the longer review+lead horizon (1+L). No evidence of new lost shipments since arrivals resumed consistently.

Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=125, in-transit=438; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P11 arrived with 4-period lag). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 2 (recent periods show mean ~155). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 2\u201315) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=14 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by sizing base_stock from recent demand estimates rather than older low-Jan samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): on-hand=222, in-transit=347. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from P1..P12 arrived after 4), so set L to calculated average. Recent demand has fallen vs early spike; using last 5 concluded demand observations (P12..P16 = 114,97,99,96,89) gives a current short-run mean ~99 units/week. With L=4, forecast (1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd799 to size replenishment; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the latest regime and reduce overstating demand. This keeps pipeline+on-hand (~569) aligned to ~495 expected 5-period demand, balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime (Periods 2-17) is elevated vs Jan baseline (carry-over confirmed +16%); observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=238, in-transit=273 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand provides substantial cover but demand regime is higher, so use recent-demand estimates. Set L by calculation from observed lead times (consistent 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat over the confirmed post-changepoint regime (Periods 2\u201317) to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility (N=16). These parameters align the OR backend's base-stock toward the higher demand while keeping holding tradeoffs explicit (profit=holding so q=0.5).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=197, in-transit=383. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, ...), so use calculate for L (avg observed = 4). Recent demand has dropped sharply over Periods 14-18 (99,96,89,58,41; mean=76.6) and this 5-period downshift is sustained (\u22653 periods). I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk. These parameters direct the OR engine to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, aligning service vs holding cost given profit=holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand fell to 76.6 over Periods 14-18 (99,96,89,58,41) vs prior regime mean ~155.2 (Periods 2-6) \u2248 -50%; sustained for 5 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use observed-average lead time. Demand has a sustained downshift starting Period 14 (Periods 14-19 demands = 99,96,89,58,41,66; recent mean \u224874.8), so forecast using the recent regime. On-hand 309 + in-transit 205 = 514 units \u2014 this covers ~5 periods at the recent mean (~75\xd75=375), indicating ample coverage; choosing recent-based mu/sigma reduces overstock risk while reflecting the lower demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 14 (Periods 14-20 demands = 99,96,89,58,41,66,44), so I forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (many Period conclude messages confirm L=4), so I let backend calculate L from observed lead times. On-hand=360 and in-transit=110 materially exceed expected demand over the lead+review horizon, so I reduce forecast horizon exposure by using recent_N for mean and volatility (captures the lower recent demand and lower variance) to avoid excess holding. Choices: L by calculate to confirm actual lead time from history; mu_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect the 7-period low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility and keep orders conservative versus holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized after the regime drop observed starting Period 14 (recent demands: P17-21 = 58,41,66,44,49; 5-period mean \u224851.6). On-hand=311 + in-transit=110 gives large available inventory vs current low demand; several past shipments confirm actual lead time \u22484. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set lead time to the empirically observed average and forecast demand using the recent 5-period regime. sigma_hat uses the same 5 most recent samples to capture current low-volatility regime. These choices reduce ordering given high inventory and lower recent demand, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders that arrived report 4 periods); use calculated lead time to match observations. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 14 (sustained ~77 avg) and recent weeks remain low (Periods 14\u201323). To capture the low-demand regime I use recent_N with N=10 (covers Periods 14\u201323) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand regime, reducing future receipts and holding cost given current high on-hand (362) and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 14; last 6 demands (Periods 19-24) = [66,44,49,35,24,27], mean \u2248 40.8. Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (many concluded observations), so use calculated lead time from observed history. To match the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost (profit=holding), set demand forecast based on the most recent 6 periods. sigma estimated from the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base-stock for the low-demand regime while respecting observed lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 14 (sustained ~76.6 then dropping further); last five observed demands (Periods 21-25) = 49,35,24,27,13 (mean=29.6). On-hand=322, in-transit=0; pipeline empty and no imminent arrivals. Promised lead time remains 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm a 4-period actual lead time when shipments arrive, so use promised L (default). To match the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods (N=5) so the OR engine targets much lower replenishment ((1+L)\xd7recent mean \u22485\xd729.6) and reduces holding cost risk given large on-hand stock and past missing/late shipments. This balances service vs holding cost by shrinking target base-stock to current demand reality while keeping L conservative (promised).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 14 (Periods 14-26 show sustained low weekly demand averaging ~76.6 with several weeks in the teens/40s), while lead time has repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand = 309 and in-transit = 0 \u2014 inventory is ample relative to the recent low-demand regime, so we should not inflate targets. Set L via empirical observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actuals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent demand regime (Periods 14-26) to avoid over-forecasting; choose N=13 (regime length) for both recent_N estimates so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most relevant samples. This keeps base stock tuned to the lower-demand regime and prevents unnecessary ordering/holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 14 demand periods for both mean and volatility so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand under the current regime. Using 'calculate' for L anchors to observed lead times; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the base-stock responsive to the sustained drop, avoiding excess future holding given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5 implies moderate service target).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=277, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals pending.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand since Period 14 has been a lower regime (Periods 14-29 demands: 99,96,89,58,41,66,44,49,35,24,27,13,13,17,15,16 \u2014 16 samples) and observed lead times consistently 4 periods for concluded arrivals. On-hand=261, in-transit=0; no urgent replenishment needed given high on-hand vs low recent demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate average \u2192 4). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent stable low-demand regime (N=16) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=16) to capture volatility of the same recent regime. These choices keep the backend base-stock aligned to the confirmed lower demand and the confirmed 4-period lead time, avoiding excess ordering while preserving service given current inventory.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand is low and stable (Periods 21-30 demands = 49,35,24,27,13,13,17,15,16,24; recent 10-period mean \u224823.3). On-hand=237, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand but we should size forecasts to the new low regime to avoid holding cost. Actual lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in history, so use promised/default L=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (last 10 samples) to reflect the current low-demand regime and lower volatility, letting the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively.

On-hand=226, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand, so use promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=4).

Use sigma_hat recent_N N=18 to capture volatility in the current regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Current on-hand=219, in-transit=0. Demand has undergone a sustained downshift starting Period 14: Periods 14-32 show low weekly demand (99,96,89,58,41,66,44,49,35,24,27,13,13,17,15,16,24,11,7) \u2014 ~19 periods in the low regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and the sustained low-demand regime, I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N (N=19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes forecast and uncertainty based on the most recent low-demand regime. This reduces target base-stock and caps order size to limit holding cost while preserving service given observed lead time.

Lead time history since Period5 consistently shows 4 periods. To avoid overstocking, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the persistent drop in demand and reduced volatility. This tightens orders to align pipeline with the lower demand, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has fallen substantially since Period 14 (sustained low weekly sales ~5-35 units). On-hand=196, in-transit=0 so current stock covers several weeks of current low demand; no overdue arrivals. Lead time historically observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time. For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=20) to compute (1+L)*mean based on the last 20 demand observations to reflect the sustained low sales and avoid overstocking. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent lower variability. These choices bias orders downward to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 14 (Period14-35 demand series: 99,96,89,58,41,41,66,44,49,35,24,27,13,13,17,15,16,24,11,7,18,5,4 -> sustained reduction vs earlier ~155). On-hand=192, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in past concluded messages. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I target the current low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 20 samples). This biases orders to current lower demand, reducing holding cost while meeting service given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 14; recent 23-period mean \u224834 units/week (down ~78% from earlier ~155). On-hand=183, in-transit=0 and no recent arrivals\u2014pipeline empty. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods when arrivals occur, so keep promised/default lead time. To match the prolonged low-demand regime I use recent data for demand estimates: use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent 20 weekly samples (focus on current low regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service with much lower forecasted demand and avoids excess holding cost. This reduces orders while preserving service given current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand fell to ~34 units/week over Periods 14-36 (23 samples, mean=780/23\u224834) vs prior regime ~155 (\u2248-78%); sustained for 23 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 14 (weekly demand ~34 over Periods 14-36). On-hand=180, in-transit=0; no recent arrivals. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (orders that concluded list lead_time=4). To avoid overstock while preserving service against the low-demand regime, I set L by averaging observed lead times and set demand estimates using the most recent regime data (recent_N) capped to 20 samples to reflect the sustained low-demand regime. Using recent_N reduces influence of the earlier high-demand regime and keeps safety stock tight given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 neutral z).

Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=179, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 14 (mean \u224834 units/week over P14\u2013P36 and very low through P38). Lead time has repeatedly observed =4 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while matching the new low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent stable regime: use recent_N=20 (captures P19\u2013P38 recent low-demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps orders aligned to current low demand and prevents further inventory build-up given zero pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 14 (mean \u224834/week); recent weeks (Periods 20\u201339) show persistently low demand. On-hand=175, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. Lead time observations consistently show 4-period arrivals (multiple concluded orders with W=4). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to anchor forecasts in the sustained low-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules), which reduces order targets and holding cost given current large on-hand stock. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 modest safety stock).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 14; last 20-week mean demand = 14.8 units/week \u2192 (1+L) demand \u2248 74 units. On-hand=174, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory comfortably covers the next (1+L) periods, so no urgent replenishment. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = promised 4 periods; therefore keep L as default. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 20 samples (captures the current regime while capping N at 20). This reduces ordering relative to the earlier high-demand regime and limits holding cost risk.

To avoid excess holding given profit=holding, I forecast using the most recent low-demand regime: set L by calculated observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low mean and low volatility (weeks 37-41). This reduces target base-stock to match current demand and limit holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14 (weekly demand collapsed to ~34 units/week across many periods) and observed arrivals consistently indicated a 4-period actual lead time when shipments concluded. Current on-hand=158, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to the low regime, so avoid aggressive replenishment. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (observed arrivals imply 4 periods). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat on the most recent sustained low-demand regime (caps N at 20 per rules) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and avoids overstocking. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent reduced volatility. This combination reduces ordering to match the new low-demand regime while the backend's capped order limits prevent extreme orders.

To align supply with the new low-demand regime and confirmed lead time, set L to calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). Use recent_N (N=23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the sustained low-demand regime (reduces orders and holding cost while preserving service).

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 14 (mean \u224834/week over many periods). To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) review+lead demand under the low-demand regime, I use promised lead time and base forecasts from the most recent low-demand samples. Chosen methods: L use default (promised 4) because observed actual lead time = promised and stable; mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)*mean on the most recent low-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules); sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to estimate recent volatility. These parameters prioritize reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14 (mean \u224834 units/week) and no evidence of renewed high demand; on-hand=148, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for many weeks at current demand. Observed lead times have repeatedly been 4 periods; no new lead-time change. I therefore keep L at the promised/default value. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the long-lived low-demand regime while limiting N to the 20-sample cap (captures most recent behavior without overfitting older high-demand weeks). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned to current low demand (reducing holding cost) while preserving service given current on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.
