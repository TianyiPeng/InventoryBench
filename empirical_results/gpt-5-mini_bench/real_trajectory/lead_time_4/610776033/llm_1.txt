Five-week demand \u2248275 units, but to limit holding-cost risk and to test supplier/actual lead time, place a partial replenishment.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-holiday week) \u2014 no expected demand spike for a basic womens T-shirt. Demand regime: historical carry-over shows sustained decline since Period 31 and especially Periods 36\u201341; recent weekly sales (P41\u2013P46) = [12,64,63,12,7,6], 6-week avg \u224827 but most recent 3 weeks = [12,7,6] trending \u22488/week. Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods; in-transit = 0. Inventory & economics: on-hand = 163. Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/period \u2014 holding inventory one extra week effectively erases expected profit from one unit sold. With low/declining demand and high holding cost relative to profit, the optimal action is to avoid replenishment and deplete inventory. Order 0 to minimize holding penalty while meeting modest expected demand from on-hand stock.",
