Tradeoff: holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19, so stocking to meet multi-period demand is profitable. Decision: override OR cap and order to cover the 5-period expected demand (m\xfb=315) rather than OR's capped 96; this aligns inventory to expected demand + leaves room for holiday uplift while avoiding the large base-stock level implied by z* (which would be 388) that could create excess inventory if demand drops.

Justification: pipeline (315) likely covers most but not all of the (L+1)=5-period expected demand (\u2248408); ordering 143 follows the OR\u2019s capped safety constraint and moves us closer to the high service-level implied by profit/holding economics while respecting OR\u2019s volatility-smoothing cap.

Demand outlook: recent 5-week demand (Periods 41\u201345) = [43,88,29,23,63], avg \u2248 49.2/week, so (L+1)=5 period demand \u2248 246 units.

Ordering additional units would raise holding cost with little incremental profit since sufficient inventory is already in pipeline.
