Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average 31.8 units/week. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected or overdue. No sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence (only 5 historical weekly samples); use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock. Choices: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect the historical weekly average scaled over review+lead period; sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to supply backend volatility for safety-stock calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed conclude shows Period1 ordered=42 arrived=0; promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs. Historical weekly demand samples mean=31.8 (samples: 28,31,39,25,36). On-hand=0, in-transit=42 which is well below (1+L)*mean demand (5*31.8\u2248159), so pipeline is insufficient. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this lets the backend size orders to cover the full review+lead period given no confirmed regime shift or lost-shipment evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=91 which equals ordered(42+49)=91; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed and no evidence of lost shipments. Historical weekly demand mean = 31.8 (samples given). Promised lead time is 4 periods; use default lead time to avoid overreacting to missing concludes. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=148. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~31.8/week. No concluded arrivals yet for recent orders (only Periods 1-3 conclude available); promised lead time (4) cannot be rejected because arrivals for recent orders would only conclude at/after Period 5. Therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR backend compute base stock while keeping safety against delayed/unknown arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demands (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~31.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=224 which equals sum of prior orders (42+49+57+76); no concluded arrivals yet but this is expected given promised lead time=4. No evidence of lost shipments or a lead-time change (orders placed in P1 would conclude in P5). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples captures the historical baseline; default volatility scales by sqrt(1+L). These settings provide the OR engine with the standard base-stock computed from historical mean/variance while avoiding premature adjustments given no confirmed changepoint.

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean\u224831.8 units. One concluded arrival shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4 (consistent with promised L=4). Current on-hand=14, in-transit=250 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand (\u2248159 over review+lead if L=4). No clear demand regime change; use defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time. This keeps base-stock tied to historical mean while avoiding overfitting to limited recent noise and accounts for large existing pipeline to limit additional ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Concluded arrivals show orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20136) = [49,57,84,53,28,78], recent average \u224858.2 vs historical sample mean 31.8 \u2192 clear upward regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual L=4. For demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=6 (regime length=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand and higher variance, which drives a larger base_stock to avoid stockouts while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap. This balances service (high profit $19) against holding cost $1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019-02-11): historical mean 31.8 -> recent mean 58.2 (+83%), sustained for 6 periods; actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent history shows a sustained demand uplift starting 2019-02-11 (recent avg \u224858.2/week) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=255 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals are delayed until their conclude messages. To capture the new higher demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility (N=6, reflecting the 6-period sustained regime) and calculate lead time from observed concludes to lock in L=4. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher (L+1)-period demand while sigma from recent data preserves safety stock for variability; this balances service level (avoid lost sales given high profit $19 vs $1 holding) against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean \u224858.2 over 6 periods since 2019-02-11) and observed lead times consistently 4 periods (orders P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=275 (covers several future periods). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the sustained post-changepoint higher mean over the last 6 samples, giving the OR engine a forecast that captures the new regime. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=6) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit position tempers additional ordering to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has shifted up vs historical samples: recent observed weekly demand ~58.2 vs historical mean 31.8. On-hand=4 + in-transit=309 => pipeline=313, which already covers multiple weeks (with L\u22484). No shipments appear overdue (arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time). To respect the confirmed higher demand regime I set L by calculation of observed lead times, and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (6 periods). This raises target base-stock to protect service while the large in-transit balance reduces immediate ordering urge.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted up and remained high since 2019-02-11 (recent sample avg ~62 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=364 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with 4-period actual lead time. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained higher regime (last 6 demand observations) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base stock reflects the new mean/volatility and avoids understocking despite pipeline delays.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime and concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4. On-hand=14, in-transit=293 (pipeline large relative to weekly demand but some arrivals are still pending). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (use average of observed lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to base mu_hat on the full recent regime (covers all available post-change samples) so the base-stock reflects the higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture sustained demand increase) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand regime is higher: confirmed shift starting 2019-02-11 with recent mean \u224858.2 units (sustained 6 periods). Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=270 \u2014 this covers ~4.6 periods of recent demand but is slightly short of (L+1)=5 periods demand (\u2248291). To protect service while limiting holding cost, I set L to the observed average lead time and base demand estimates on the recent 6-period regime (captures the sustained higher demand). Sigma is also derived from the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=2, in-transit=289. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), and demand has shifted upward and remained elevated (recent mean ~58.2 over last 6 periods). To reflect confirmed LT and recent higher demand I set L to be calculated from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast and volatility on the new regime. This raises the base-stock to protect service given large in-transit volume uncertainty while limiting excess holding by using recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-02-11 (Period 1) with average demand rising ~+83% and multiple concluded orders confirming actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (several prior orders in pipeline). To capture the higher recent demand while relying on confirmed lead time, I keep L at the promised/default (4) and use recent_N for demand stats to reflect the new regime. I select N=6 (captures the most recent 6 demand observations since the regime shift and satisfies the 3\u2264N\u226420 rule) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate to the elevated mean and recent volatility, avoiding understocking given the confirmed 4-period lead time and substantial pipeline but zero on-hand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6 etc.) and a sustained demand regime increase beginning 2019-02-11: recent concluded demands (Periods 10-15) = [50,78,126,100,152,118], recent mean = 104. I set L to default (promised=4) because concluded history confirms 4. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (captures the sustained higher-demand regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last6) so backend will target ~5*104). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the new higher-demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=572 units (covers multiple review+lead periods: (1+L)=5). Observed concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods; use default lead time to align with OR engine. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (6-period regime length) so the backend base_stock and cap reflect current elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples. This balances service level (high profit) against holding cost given large in-transit buffer.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been in a higher sustained regime since Period 1 (starting 2019-02-11); observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 in all concluded shipments. Current inventory: on-hand=29, in-transit=563. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (the full recent regime length) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects the sustained higher mean/volatility rather than older low-demand samples. This raises target stock to reduce lost sales while sigma recent_N captures recent variability; using observed lead time avoids under- or over-ordering given delayed arrivals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). SKU 692226004: profit $19/unit, holding $1/unit/period. On-hand=63, in-transit=435 (pipeline large relative to recent weekly demand). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (multiple P1->P5..P14->P18 observations). Demand has shifted up and been sustained; recent periods show higher weekly demand than early history. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empiric L=4. For forecasting I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new, sustained high-demand regime (uses the most recent 6 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std), which raises base-stock to maintain service while avoiding excessive hold given large pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple P1->P5...P15->P19 observations); use calculated lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 1 with recent mean ~58.2 (carry-over): use recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast on the new regime when computing (1+L)-period demand and volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples and acknowledges ample pipeline inventory to limit additional ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been substantially higher than the small historical sample (sustained high-demand regime since Period 1 per earlier insight). On-hand=102 + in-transit=435 = 537 units. Promised lead time is 4 and arrivals historically confirm lead_time=4; keep promised lead time. Use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the sustained high-demand regime across all available periods (N=20 = available sample count). This biases base-stock upward to avoid stockouts while sigma recent_N captures current variability. No evidence of new lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:

Pipeline + on-hand covers several weeks but there was an arrival=0 in last conclude (Period 22) which may indicate a delayed shipment; therefore I keep lead time estimate anchored to observed behavior. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures the +83% uplift). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the backend to target a higher base-stock appropriate for the new demand level while respecting the capped order size to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Demand has been higher than the small Jan samples; to capture the sustained higher regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to weight recent weeks (cap at 20) so the OR engine raises base-stock while smoothing volatility. This also provides buffer against occasional missing arrivals given some orders showed arrived=0 in recent concludes.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand regime is elevated (carry-over: Period 1 onward mean rose from 31.8 to 58.2, sustained). On-hand=226 + in-transit=312 provides substantial coverage vs. higher demand; several past orders confirmed lead_time=4 (consistent P1->P5 etc.). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures the +83% shift). I keep sigma_hat as 'default' to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while using observed lead time and standardized volatility to balance holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-02-11 (sustained higher mean); historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6 observations). Current inventory: on-hand=290, in-transit=272 (total pipeline=562). Given confirmed LT=4 and sustained demand lift, I use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) so backend and policy align. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime; sigma_hat uses default to reflect overall observed variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize matching higher recent demand while avoiding overstating variability; current pipeline already provides substantial cover, so the OR engine can cap orders appropriately to balance service level and holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime versus early 2019; actual lead time has repeatedly observed as 4 periods. Current on-hand 328 + in-transit 190 = 518 units, which covers multiple upcoming periods but demand remains elevated. I set L by calculating from observed lead-time data to confirm the empirically observed 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to make the forecast responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing over short noise; this helps the OR backend raise the base stock to avoid stockouts under the confirmed higher demand while controlling holding cost by using a recent-window estimate rather than all-time mean.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=352, in-transit=192; profit $19, holding $1. Historical early samples (mean=31.8) understate current demand \u2014 a sustained regime shift toward higher demand has been observed in recent periods. Lead time evidence from concluded periods consistently shows 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). To reflect the confirmed LT=4 and capture the recent higher-demand regime, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to weight the most recent demand history (captures new regime and increases base_stock for service while limiting overstating variability). These choices ensure the OR backend raises target stock to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility for safety against stockouts and limiting excess holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5 ... P25->P29 observations). Recent demand regime is well above the 5-sample historical baseline (early 2019); last 10 concluded demand samples (P20\u2013P29) average ~63.6 units/week, reflecting the sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=388 and in-transit=167 provide coverage, but I use recent demand to size review+lead demand. Choices: L by 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4; mu_hat by 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples); sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent variability. This raises the base-stock to improve service while keeping holding cost considered by OR backend's q formula.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent observed demand has trended down over the past several months (Period 26-30 demands = 43,44,39,24,18; recent mean \u2248 33.6) while on-hand is high (437) and 100 in-transit. Concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods, so use default L to keep OR engine aligned. To avoid excess holding cost given the clear recent downward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand and reduced volatility, limiting new orders while maintaining service. This balances profit per unit vs low holding cost and addresses potential overstock risk.

On-hand 431 + in-transit 100 = 531 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand if L=4. Observed concluded lead times consistently =4. I choose L via recent observed lead times (calculate), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower-demand regime (uses last 5 weeks), keeping safety appropriate while avoiding excess holding cost.

Historical arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many P->P+4 concludes); current demand has trended down from prior summer peaks toward lower weekly sales in recent weeks. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent lower demand, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=8).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the earlier high-growth regime; on-hand is large (495) and in-transit=0, so risk of holding cost is material. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time; some earlier zero-arrivals indicated missed shipments but subsequent periods confirm L=4. I choose L by calculating average observed lead times (uses concluded evidence). For forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all samples (stable long-run estimate) scaled by (1+L); given the large on-hand this avoids over-ordering while preserving service level driven by the backend's profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=484, in-transit=0. Historical lead-time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed earlier); no new lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. Recent realized demand has fallen sharply and consistently over the last 6 conclude periods (Periods 29-34 demands = 24,18,6,15,21,11; recent mean ~15.8), so I use a recent_N forecast to reflect the current lower-demand regime. I set L=default to retain promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to scale the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the recent low-demand regime, reducing excess ordering and holding cost while preserving service given current demand.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations), so use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time. Demand has moved through multiple regimes since the early 2019 spike; to capture the most recent demand level and variance I use recent_N with N=20 (uses last 20 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock appropriate to current demand while avoiding overreacting to early outliers. High on-hand inventory suggests conservative ordering; these settings reduce ordering aggressiveness while preserving service given L=4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has settled much lower than early-period surge: last 6 demands (Periods 31-36) = [6,15,21,11,9,8], recent mean \u224811.67/week. On-hand=467, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals visible). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use promised/default lead time. To size orders conservatively to current low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the recent low-demand regime of 6 periods). This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean tied to recent demand and sigma reflecting recent volatility, reducing excess holding while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=445, in-transit=0. Historical evidence (Period5\u201321) confirmed actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has fallen sharply vs. earlier regime; last 6 demands (Periods 32\u201337) average ~14 units/week. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and low recent demand, keep promised lead time and base forecast on most recent 6 periods. Use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing new receipts while maintaining service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=433, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory vs recent low demand. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=4 in earlier periods, but recent sustained low demand since Period 30. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (last 9 periods, Periods 30\u201338) to capture the new low-demand regime (avg \u224813.56/week) so the OR backend reduces replenishment targets and avoids excess holding cost. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to reflect lower recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current low demand) against holding cost given large on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: recent avg (Periods 30\u201338)=13.56 vs prior reported recent mean 58.2 (\u2248-76.7%), sustained for 9 periods

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting ~Period 30 (recent avg \u224813.56) after an earlier high regime; observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. On-hand=426, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand, so keep lead time estimate at observed average and set demand forecast from the recent low regime (to avoid overstock growth). Chosen L: calculate (uses observed lead times = 4). Chosen mu_hat: recent_N with N=9 to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201338/39). Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N with N=9 to reflect volatility in the recent low-demand regime. These parameters reduce replenishment to match the new lower demand and limit holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in the low-teens since Period 30 (sustained drop); on-hand=419, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals visible). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods earlier; no new evidence of a lead-time change. I therefore use calculate for L (backend will infer avg observed lead time=4). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime since Period 30, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 30\u201340) so the backend sizes base stock to current lower demand and lowers safety stock accordingly, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service for the new regime.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 30 (sustained low regime: avg \u224813.6/week vs prior \u224858.2). On-hand=393, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock today, no overdue confirmed arrivals. Use lead-time inference from concluded arrivals (multiple P->P+4 observations), so set L by calculation of observed lead times. For demand forecasting, use a recent_N regime to capture the low-demand regime (use most recent 13 periods from the changepoint at Period 30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets much lower replenishment; this prevents excessive holding cost while maintaining service. Sigma set via recent_N to reflect lower volatility in the recent regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (Periods 31\u201343 avg \u224811.3 units/week over 13 weeks). On-hand=390, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs. low recent demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods; promised lead time = 4. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 (use the 13 most recent weeks since the regime change at Period 30) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean over the current low-demand regime. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=13 to reflect observed low-regime volatility. These choices reduce order quantity relative to historical high-demand regime, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service for current low demand.

Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (sustained ~6\u201322/week); on-hand=374, in-transit=0 so inventory is ample versus current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. To avoid overstock while matching the recent low-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent samples (the regime from Period 30\u201346, length 17). Use recent_N (N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and caps based on the current low-demand mean and volatility, reducing unnecessary additional receipts and holding cost exposure.
