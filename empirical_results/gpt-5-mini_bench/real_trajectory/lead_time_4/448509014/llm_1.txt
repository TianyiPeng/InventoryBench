Excluding the 3-unit outlier, the recent 4-week average \u2248 182 units/week; variability but no confirmed sustained regime change. c) Lead time & orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no in-transit or concluded arrivals yet, so assume promised LT until contradicted. d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; any order placed now will arrive during Period 5 (i.e., after four full periods). Sales will occur each period but cannot be fulfilled until arrival, so stockouts will occur for the next four periods regardless. e) Order logic: To cover demand starting when the order arrives and to target a normal service level while avoiding excessive multi-period holding (holding cost = profit per unit), place an order to cover (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand: 5 \xd7 182 \u2248 910. Rounding conservatively to 900 units (slightly lower to limit holding exposure) balances expected sales captured after arrival vs holding cost.",

Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods (multiple P conclude lines). Pipeline: on-hand=166, in-transit=480 which breaks down to P41->60 arriving during P45 and P43->420 arriving during P47. No other arrivals before P47. Since orders placed now would arrive in P49, they cannot help cover the immediate risk window. Demand to cover before the next major arrival (P47) is P45 and P46; on-hand plus the 60 arriving this period = 226 units. Given recent two-week demand average is low (~77) and only occasional spikes occurred, ordering now would only create extra holding cost (holding cost = profit per unit). Therefore place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while the pipeline already provides a substantial upcoming replenishment (420 in P47).",
