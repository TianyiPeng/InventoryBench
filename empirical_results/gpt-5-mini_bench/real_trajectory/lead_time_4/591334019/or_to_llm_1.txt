From order history, the in-transit 715 is composed of P34:400 (arriving during Period38) and P35:315 (arriving during Period39), so those will only become available after their respective arrival resolutions (not visible until next period conclude).

Recent demand (Periods 43\u201346) = [71,60,59,42], avg \u224858 units/period. Five-period demand = 5\xd758 = 290 units. Shortfall = 290 \u2212 273 = 17 units. OR recommended 108 (uses promised L and historical samples) but that would materially increase holding cost given already-large on-hand. Given confirmed L=4, recent stable demand ~58 and the need only to top up the pipeline to cover next 5 periods, place a small replenishment to cover the 17-unit shortfall plus a tiny buffer. Final action = 20 units (rounding up to avoid immediate stockout risk).",
