Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [41,41,41,47,51], mean=44.2. No arrivals or concluded lead-time observations yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample\u2014this balances service vs. holding given symmetric profit=holding cost and no detected regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly samples show mean ~44.2 (41,41,41,47,51). Period 1 conclude shows ordered=52 arrived=0 and an atypical demand=158 in Period 1; this is a single-period spike (not yet sustained). No concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change. I therefore keep the promised lead time and use default demand/volatility calculation so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, avoiding overreacting to a single anomalous week while covering L+1 periods of demand given the pipeline of 52 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent weekly demand samples: [41,41,41,47,51], mean=44.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=192 (orders of 52 and 140 placed in P1/P2) but neither concluded yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time from these missing arrivals per rules. Promised lead time remains the conservative default and historical demand appears stable (no sustained changepoint). I therefore use default methods so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays. If arrivals continue missing beyond the promised lead time, I will switch to an explicit/recent estimate in future periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~44.2 units; recent conclude messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133, so actual lead time cannot be confidently estimated from concluded arrivals. To avoid overreacting to possible lost/delayed shipments while leveraging the known promised lead time, I use default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This keeps the ordering conservative given the large in-transit volume and balances service level vs. holding cost without double-counting uncertain lead-time shifts.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (ordered 52, 140, 327) with arrived=0 in concludes through Period 3 \u2014 suggests shipments are delayed or may be lost; treat as potential lead-time issue until an arrival conclude confirms actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) is very high and well above historical Jan samples (demands: 158,392,359,263), on-hand=0, in-transit=707 (equals orders 52+140+327+188). All four recent orders have concluded with arrived=0 => sustained missing/delayed shipments. To be conservative I set L explicitly longer than the promised 4 to allow the OR backend to hold more pipeline coverage; demand forecast uses the recent 4 periods to capture the new high-demand regime; volatility also uses recent 4 to reflect current variability. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit = holding cost) while acknowledging shipment risk; if arrivals later conclude, we'll revise L downward.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered 52,140,327,188; in-transit=707) with arrived=0 in Periods 1-4 concludes \u2014 suspect delayed or lost shipments; treat lead time as longer than promised until an arrival conclude confirms actual lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime is much higher than the Jan samples: Periods 1-5 demands = [158,392,359,263,192]. On-hand=0, in-transit=1122 (many prior orders outstanding, one arrival confirmed). Period 5 conclude shows an arrival from Period 1 with observed lead_time=4 \u2192 use observed lead times to set L. Demand forecasting: use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime for both mean and volatility. These parameters (L via calculate; mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5) align the backend base-stock calculation to the current high-demand regime while recognizing confirmed lead time and the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5, observed lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized demands (P1-P6 = 158,392,359,263,192,179) are far above the older seed samples, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods by concluded arrivals (P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=1224 (covers multiple future periods). To reflect the confirmed LT=4 and the recent high demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will produce 4). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the six most recent demand observations, keeping orders responsive to the new regime while the large in-transit position moderates immediate ordering.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=46, in-transit=959 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to historical weekly demand (samples mean=44.2). To align OR backend with observed lead time and stable historical demand, set L to calculated (avg observed = 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving historical demand signal while the large pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency and avoids overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand regime is much higher than the Jan historical samples: Periods 1-8 demands = [158,392,359,263,192,179,281,359], mean=272.875, high variance. All four recent concluded orders show lead_time=4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8) so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=771 (covers several future periods). I set L by calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the last 8 periods, which balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and substantial pipeline already in flight.

On-hand=252 and in-transit=727; pipeline + on-hand covers multiple review+lead periods. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates (no recent sustained demand regime change in the provided samples). These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to long-run sample stats while avoiding overreacting to transient arrivals/delays.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand regime is elevated (recent weekly demands P6-10 = 179,281,359,215,173). On-hand=321 + in-transit=485 -> pipeline=806 units. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history (consistent 4). I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, higher-demand regime using the last 5 periods (P6-10). Sigma also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the backend size base stock to cover (1+L) periods under the confirmed lead time and recent higher mean while using recent volatility to avoid excess holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P7 arrived with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=223, in-transit=794. Pipeline + on-hand cover multiple upcoming periods, no new missing-arrival signal. Given confirmed LT=4, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7overall mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7overall std from the full sample set; this leverages all historical demand data and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5) without overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed by concluded arrivals from orders placed P1\u2192P5 etc.), so set L to calculated observed lead time. Historical demand samples (provided five weekly samples, mean=44.2) imply (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*44.2=221 units; on-hand=112 and in-transit=794 (total pipeline large), so use default demand/volatility calculations to let backend compute base stock while capping orders. Profit and holding equal (q=0.5) => z*\u22480, so keeping mu_hat at default balances service vs holding given heavy pipeline coverage.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders placed in P1\u2013P9 consistently arrived with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=456, in-transit=371. Several earlier periods showed large realized demand (~160\u2013359) \u2014 this is substantially above the small-sample historical catalog (41\u201351). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (use recent 5 demand observations to form (1+L)\xd7mean), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so variability reflects the recent regime. These choices align pipeline coverage to (1+L) periods, reduce stockout risk given confirmed L=4, and avoid under-forecasting from old low-volume catalog samples. Current on-hand + in-transit (827 total) will be reconciled by the OR engine against the computed base_stock; using recent data raises mu_hat and sigma_hat to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=369, in-transit=371. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P11 that arrived report lead_time=4). Inventory is healthy (net 740 units across on-hand+in-transit) vs historical weekly mean; profit and holding cost are equal ($1), so target service level is 50% (z\u22480). Use inferred average lead time from observed concludes and default demand stats to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance, which is appropriate given no recent sustained demand regime shift and confirmed LT=4. This balances fill rate vs holding given high current inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315) average \u2248108.6 units/week; on-hand+in-transit = 744 which covers ~6.8 weeks at that rate. To match confirmed LT and recent demand regime I choose L by calculation (use observed lead times) and set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L)*recent_mean = 5*108.6 = 543. For variability I provide an explicit sigma_hat estimate based on recent sample std (\u224831.6) scaled by sqrt(1+L): sqrt(5)*31.6 \u2248 70.7. These settings give the OR backend a demand forecast anchored to recent realized sales while using confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given past delays.

Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed observations. Use default demand and volatility (all-samples) scaled by (1+L) because historical sample set is limited and current on-hand + pipeline is ample versus forecasted need; this avoids overreacting to past delayed shipments while the supply pattern is stable.

Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) have mean=44.2/week; carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent observed concludes). To align with observed lead time I select L by calculation of observed lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a conservative replenishment tied to confirmed LT=4 and historical variability; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and past delayed arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent conclude history consistently shows orders arriving with lead_time=4 (e.g., P1->P5, P2->P6, ... through P20->P24). On-hand=521, in-transit=139; pipeline + on-hand ample vs recent weekly demand (historical samples mean ~ 46/week). Given confirmed actual lead time=4, set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect evidence. Use default demand/statistics scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap using all samples; this balances service (profit=holding, equal costs) without overreacting to short-term noise and accounts for 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed conclues: orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, etc.)

On-hand=540, in-transit=98; pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. recent low weekly demand (historical sample mean ~44). No evidence of new demand regime or lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time to keep model aligned with observed L=4. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes a base-stock that balances service (profit=holding, q=0.5) while avoiding excess ordering given high current on-hand.

On-hand=566, in-transit=42 \u2014 ample cover versus typical weekly demand (historical sample mean=44.2 units).

Current available inventory (on-hand 470 + in-transit 62) is ample vs typical weekly demand; no new missing-arrival pattern since lead time confirmations. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history so it balances service level vs holding cost using the profit/(profit+holding) design.

Recent demand shows no sustained regime change requiring an adjusted forecast. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised/confirmed lead time and long-run demand samples, set L=default (use promised), mu_hat=default ((1+L)*mean of samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)*std of samples).

Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so target service level is 50%. I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand stats (use all samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This leverages full historical demand to produce the base-stock while respecting confirmed LT=4 and balancing service vs. holding given symmetric costs. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments are needed because arrivals have been consistently concluding with LT=4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, ... P31->P35), so use observed lead-time estimate. I select L="calculate" to let the backend average observed lead times (which are effectively 4). I select mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; with profit=holding, this balances fill-rate vs holding cost conservatively given ample on-hand stock and confirmed L=4.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=364, in-transit=133. Historical conclues consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations through Period 36). No recent sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demand has been moderate and stable. I therefore use default (promised) lead time to let the OR engine use full history, and default demand/volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders aligned with the confirmed L=4 and leverages the long-run mean/variance to balance service level vs holding cost while acknowledging shipments have been reliable at LT=4 in concluded history. No overdue/lost shipments currently unaccounted for in concluded messages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand samples show weekly demands varying ~24\u201382 with no clear regime shift; on-hand=301, in-transit=128 so pipeline+on-hand covers multiple weeks given current demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. I therefore use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters aligned with long-run observed demand and confirmed LT=4, avoiding overreaction to recent noise while balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=196, in-transit=147. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations P1->P5, P2->P6, ...). No recent evidence of a changepoint in demand mean/variance. To keep the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time and long-run demand samples, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so base-stock is computed from overall sample mean/std across the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (confirmed L=4) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=108, in-transit=296. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed across many periods), and recent demand shows no sustained regime shift. I choose default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full historical sample set and the promised lead time (4) to compute base-stock and caps. This leverages the stable lead-time evidence, uses all demand history for a robust mean/variance estimate, and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost automatically.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=11, in-transit=379. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations through Period 40). No clear recent demand regime shift\u2014weekly demands vary but show stable average relative to longer history. Given confirmed lead time and no strong recent changepoint, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the OR engine's capped policy manages order size vs. pipeline. This addresses missing/late shipments because actual lead time equals promised (4), so default L is appropriate and avoids overreacting to transient gaps.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=0, in-transit=494. Recent demand has stepped up (weeks ~37\u201341 showing ~80\u2013165 units/week); to respond to this regime I use a short recent window (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand while keeping L at the promised/confirmed value. This balances service (avoid stockouts during higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

No new sustained demand regime change detected; recent demand includes holiday spikes but not a sustained shift. Given profit = holding, critical ratio ~0.5 (balanced service vs. holding). Use promised/confirmed L so backend computes (1+L)*mean over full history and corresponding sigma, allowing the OR engine to apply its capped base-stock policy while preserving service-level vs. holding tradeoff.
