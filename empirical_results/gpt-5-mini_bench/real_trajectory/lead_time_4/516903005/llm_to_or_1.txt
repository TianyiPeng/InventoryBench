Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time is 4. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 17.8 units/week and low volatility (std ~2.04). With no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full sample statistics. This balances service (covering current + L future weeks) against holding costs given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=22 (ordered in P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default L=4). Historical weekly demand mean = 17.8 (samples: 20,14,19,18,18). With L=4 use default forecasting (mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical demand while accounting for the 5-period review+lead horizon and avoids overreacting to the single delayed/non-concluded arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals exist, so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Recent concluded demands (P1=11, P2=31) are insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift versus historical weekly samples (2019-01: 20,14,19,18,18). To avoid overreacting to limited recent noise and because lead-time evidence is absent, use defaults: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level (covers review+lead demand using historical mean) against holding cost while preserving responsiveness if future conclude messages reveal lead-time or demand shifts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (Periods1-3) = [11,31,14]; historical weekly samples (Jan) mean \u224817.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=75 (matches orders placed P1-3); no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected given promised lead time=4 (no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments). I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand statistics so backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma. This keeps forecasts stable (no premature regime change) while the pipeline is monitored for overdue shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=104. No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in Periods 1-4 have not arrived), so actual lead time is unconfirmed and shipments may be delayed or still in-transit. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting to missing concludes. Use default demand and volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given no strong evidence of a demand regime change.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average ~17.8 units/week. On-hand=3, in-transit=89. Period 5 conclude shows arrival of the Period 1 order with lead_time=4, matching the promised lead time. No sustained evidence of changed demand regime or lost shipments yet. Use lead-time inference from observed arrival (confirming L\u22484) but let backend average observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples\u2014this balances service level using historical mean while keeping holding costs low given ample pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=22 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $494.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1 and P2 arrived with W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=84 (pipeline large). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 17.8 and modest variance. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for the 5-period coverage (current + 4-period lead) and modest safety stock given profit vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=22 units ordered P1, LT=4). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=86. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean 17.8 units; with L=4 the (1+L) multiplier=5 -> baseline demand across review+lead ~89 units. Given confirmed LT and no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift, use defaults so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (covering ~5 weeks of historical mean) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent realized demand has risen materially: last 4 period demands = [19,34,38,34] (avg 31.25), well above older baseline (historical sample mean 17.8). Observed lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed in concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=93 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but demand has shifted up, so increase target stock to protect service. Set L by calculating average observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=132. Historical concludes show sustained higher demand since Period 5 (demands: P5=19, P6=34, P7=38, P8=34, P9=36). Lead time observed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine targets service for the elevated mean and observed volatility while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19). This balances higher fill-rate against modest holding penalties.

Lead time observations are consistently 4 periods. To avoid stockouts while limiting excess holding, set lead time to the observed average and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated regime; use the same recent window for volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=16, in-transit=153. Historical weekly demand samples (seed): [20,14,19,18,18] with mean=17.8. Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods (carry-over). No new sustained demand regime or lead-time change detected. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 4), mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps parameters anchored to long-run data while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time and avoids overreacting to recent variability; it balances service level (through base-stock calculation) and holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=20, in-transit=117. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12). Recent demand (Periods 5\u201312) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier samples: avg_recent \u224829.4 vs prior mean 17.8. To capture the sustained demand increase while using confirmed lead time, I keep L as promised (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 8-period regime (recent_N, N=8) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility across the review+lead horizon. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given the higher realized demand while keeping holding cost in mind; using recent_N for sigma improves safety-stock sizing from observed recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 5: avg demand (Periods 5\u201312)=29.4 vs earlier mean(earlier samples)=17.8 (+65%), sustained for 8 periods

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (observed arrivals consistently from orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (previous insight). Current inventory: on-hand 52, in-transit 111 -> pipeline 163 units. To respect the confirmed lead time and recent higher-demand regime, I use the promised/default lead time and recent data to forecast demand across the (1+L) review+lead window. I select recent_N with N=9 (Periods 5\u201313) to capture the sustained regime while allowing the OR backend to compute mu_hat/sigma_hat scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use recent higher mean) vs holding cost by not overreacting to a single low demand in Period 13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (avg ~29.4 over Periods 5\u201312). On-hand=80, in-transit=76 (total pipeline=156) which comfortably covers upcoming demand but we retain the higher-demand regime in forecasts. Set L to promised (4). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime length = 10 periods, use N=10). This raises target base-stock to balance service with low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=86, in-transit=62. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (higher mean). No shipments appear overdue. Set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4 from concluded history. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 5\u201315 constitute the current higher-demand regime) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the recent elevated regime rather than the older low-demand samples; this increases service during the sustained higher-demand period while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (Periods 5\u201316 avg \u224829.4 vs earlier \u224817.8). On-hand=73 + in-transit=78 => pipeline=151, which covers ~5 periods at the new demand level (L+1=5). Promised lead time is 4 and prior conclude messages confirm actual LT=4, so use default lead time. To respect the confirmed higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples: recent_N with N=12 (regime length Periods 5\u201316 =12). This biases the backend forecast toward the elevated demand while the pipeline provides near-term cover; it balances service (reduce stockouts during high regime) against holding cost by using recent demand mean and recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 5 (higher mean). On-hand=103, in-transit=47 \u2014 pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs. near-term demand but we must size across review+lead. Set L to default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the post-change regime (Periods 5\u201317 available, regime length \u224813) so the OR engine targets the higher demand mean and observed volatility; this balances service (profit=$19) against low holding cost ($1) by aligning base-stock to the new demand level while letting the backend cap limit extreme orders.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=90, in-transit=43; recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals). Demand showed a sustained upshift in Periods 5\u201312 but has softened in Periods 13\u201318 (recent mean ~16), so no new sustained regime to warrant changing forecasts. Given confirmed lead time=4 and mixed recent demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (leveraging full sample history) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while the cap will limit ordering given current pipeline inventory. This balances high profit (drives service) against holding cost and the current large on-hand + in-transit position.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent on-hand=98, in-transit=37. Historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time=4 (confirmed earlier). Demand spike in Periods 5\u201312 (+65%) was sustained then faded; most recent 7 demands (Periods 13\u201319) average \u224814.4/week (much lower). Given the drop, I use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect the latest regime and avoid overstock. Keeping L=default (promised 4) is appropriate because concluded history confirms 4. Using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime, reducing excess ordering while maintaining service given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=109, in-transit=21 (pipeline=130). Historical/game history shows confirmed lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 5 (Periods 5\u201312 avg=29.4) and sustained for 8 periods; recent lower draws exist but not yet a sustained new regime. To cover review+lead (1+L=5) periods and respect the confirmed higher-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the sustained higher-demand regime (5-period aggregate = (1+L)*mean_recent), which raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma recent_N captures realized volatility. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by prioritizing availability under the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to short noisy dips.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Several orders have concluded with lead_time=4 historically, matching promised lead time. I use L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N to capture the sustained higher regime (use the last 17 post-changepoint samples, Periods 5\u201321) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat reflects recent volatility; this keeps service high for the higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating variability and excess holding given current large on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent on-hand=91 + in-transit=32 => pipeline=123 units. Promised L=4 (use default). Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime; last 10 observed weekly demands (Periods 13\u201322) average ~13.9. To reflect the current lower regime I use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent std. This keeps orders aligned to the recent low demand and avoids excess holding cost given already ample pipeline inventory.

Demand rose starting Period 5 and has remained elevated vs. earlier samples; therefore I bias forecasts to recent demand. Set L to promised (4). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent mean/volatility while limiting noise from very old low-demand samples. This keeps base_stock responsive to the sustained higher regime and avoids excessive understocking given observed arrivals and the 4-period lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 5 (carry-over noted): recent avg demand ~29.4 over Periods 5\u201312 and extended thereafter. On-hand=79, in-transit=26 => pipeline available \u2248105 units, comfortable but demand remains elevated. Use promised lead time (default=4) since concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility), which biases the base-stock toward higher service for the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. This balances service (profit $19/unit) against modest holding cost $1/unit/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime (Periods 5\u201312 avg=29.4) to a sustained lower level over the last 13 periods (Periods 13\u201325 mean \u224813.5). On-hand=60 + in-transit=59 => pipeline=119 units, which comfortably covers several upcoming review+lead periods (promised L=4). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use observed-average lead time. To reflect the recent sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13 samples (N=13) so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on current demand behavior and avoids excess holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many P->P+4 observations), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5; to capture that sustained shift I use the most recent data window to forecast demand and volatility. On-hand=50 + in-transit=33 => pipeline=83 units; with L=4 the OR needs (1+L)=5 periods coverage, so I supply mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N=20 to reflect current elevated mean and variance and avoid understocking while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been elevated versus the 2019 Jan baseline (historical samples show a sustained regime shift starting Period 5, avg ~29.4). Latest concluded Periods show large realized demand (Period 26=36, Period 27=67) and current inventory = on-hand 0 + in-transit 71. All concluded arrivals continue to confirm actual lead time = 4. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while limiting noise from a single extreme spike, I use recent_N=8 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 demand observations. L uses default (promised 4) since concluded history supports it. These choices give the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand forecast centered on the recent regime and a matching recent volatility estimate, which raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts but keeps sigma from being dominated by one period spike.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been well above the original historical mean (sustained regime shift since Period 5) and recent weeks show very high peaks (Periods 27\u201328 demands 67,68). On-hand=0, in-transit=128 \u2014 substantial pipeline but current on-hand is zero so risk of stockout before arrivals. Lead time has been previously confirmed at 4 periods; therefore use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned with confirmed lead time. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the last ~20 periods (captures the sustained higher mean and recent spikes) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects elevated demand and increased variability, improving service while controlling holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (recent demands: P24-29 = 5,19,36,67,68,59) compared with early-season lows; prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=148 (pipeline large but some recent orders showed no arrival on promised cadence). To capture the recent higher-demand regime and current volatility, I set L=default (promised 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the latest 6 weeks of demand (keeps (1+L)\xd7mean responsive to current spike). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility for safety stock. These choices bias orders toward higher service during the current high-demand, volatile regime while respecting the backend cap.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been much higher than historical pre-period-5 levels (sustained regime shift recorded earlier: avg ~29.4/week since Period 5). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=234 \u2014 pipeline looks large but several recent large orders have not yet concluded (arrivals absent in immediate concludes), consistent with in-transit backlog rather than shorter lead time. I therefore keep L at default (use promised lead time / previously confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N to focus the estimator on the post-changepoint high-demand regime: N=20 (regime length >20, capped at 20). I apply the same recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability; using default L prevents overreacting to temporary missing-conclude noise.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand shows a sustained elevated regime since Period 5 (carry-over: avg 29.4 vs earlier 17.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=235 (covers multiple future periods). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 in history. To capture the elevated demand regime I use a recent window to compute demand across review+lead. Set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent sustained regime (N chosen as min(regime_length,20) with regime_length >20). This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean) and repeated observed lead times = 4. Pipeline (285) is large relative to recent weekly demand but arrivals are delayed by confirmed L=4; keep lead-time estimate based on observed arrivals. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained high-demand regime while capping to 20 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 20 demands). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock to the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility while using observed lead time to avoid understocking from delayed arrivals.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since late Aug (Periods 27\u201333: 67,68,59,145,152,193,594) indicating a new high-demand regime (likely seasonal/markdown activity). On-hand=0, in-transit=368 (pipeline substantial but uncertain timing). Lead times observed consistently =4 in concluded history; use calculated lead time to reflect confirmed observations. For demand I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent regime (Periods 27\u201333, length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-variance, elevated-demand regime and keep base-stock responsive while the pipeline depletes. This balances service (capture high profit $19/unit) against holding cost $1/unit by using recent data rather than long-run averages.

Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (noted in carry-over) and very large recent spikes (Periods 30\u201334 demands = 145,152,193,594,147). Use promised lead time (default=4). Capture the recent high-demand regime by using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the last five observed demands (most relevant to current peak). This balances service (avoid stockouts during spike) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5; recent demand is much higher than the early-sample mean. To reflect confirmed lead time evidence I request the backend compute the empirical average lead time (calculate). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 (covers the most recent 20 concluded demand periods within the elevated regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and service target reflect current demand volatility while the capped order prevents excessive single-period ordering given holding cost (profit=$19 vs holding=$1 encourages high service but we keep pipeline-aware sizing).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1197 (large pipeline). Profit=19, holding=1. Historical data and provided carry-over confirm a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (avg 29.4 vs earlier 17.8). Promised lead time is 4 (use default). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set demand estimates using recent_N over the recent regime length; choose N=20 (regime length >20, cap at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean and volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits new ordering risk.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (previously recorded); recent history shows very large weekly demand spikes (esp. Periods 28\u201336). On-hand=0, in-transit=1061 (pipeline large). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent data, I set L to the calculated/confirmed value and use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand samples (cap N at 20 for stability). This keeps orders responsive to the elevated demand while the large in-transit position will be reconciled by the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand shows a large, sustained spike in late Sep\u2013Oct (Periods 31\u201338) with very high weekly sales; on-hand=354, in-transit=568 so pipeline is rich but recent demand regime is elevated. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep consistency with confirmed observations. For demand forecast use recent_N on the most recent 8 weeks (Periods 31\u201338) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking. Use recent_N for sigma as well to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect service during the sustained surge while the large pipeline buffers immediate shortages.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=849, in-transit=468. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (Periods 5\u201312 average 29.4 vs earlier 17.8). Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N based on the sustained higher-demand regime: take the most recent regime window (capped at 20) to focus the forecast on the elevated demand level and recent volatility. This raises (1+L)\xd7mean and \u03c3 estimates to reduce stockouts while the large on-hand+pipleline already provides buffer; it balances higher service (profit per unit $19) against holding cost ($1) by reflecting the persistent higher demand in mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-18 (Period 41). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (carry-over: avg Periods 5\u201312 = 29.4 vs earlier 17.8). On-hand=766, in-transit=468 (pipeline large relative to demand). No new evidence of lead-time change (confirmed L=4 previously). To bias ordering toward the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the backend use promised lead time, I keep L=default (promised=4) and use recent_N demand estimates (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent elevated mean/volatility; this avoids diluting the forecast with the low pre-shift samples and prevents overreacting to short spikes given a sizable pipeline. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent-sample uncertainty in sigma_hat.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has shown a sustained high spike since late Aug/Sep (many periods with very large demand). On-hand=692, in-transit=468 \u2014 large stock already covers multiple weeks (\u2248 (692+468)/recent weekly demand). Promised lead time=4 and earlier conclude messages confirmed actual L=4. To capture the recent high-demand regime while acknowledging large existing inventory, I keep L at default (promised 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures the post-Aug spike) and set sigma_hat recent_N to reflect recent volatility. I choose N=5 (uses last 5 weeks) which balances responsiveness and sample stability. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock appropriate for the current high-demand regime while the large on-hand + in-transit will naturally cap new orders via the backend cap, avoiding excessive ordering.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (noted in carry-over) and confirmed stable actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=653, in-transit=468 (large pipeline). No arrivals were concluded in Period 42. Given high on-hand + in-transit relative to recent weekly demand, I will use the promised lead time (default) and let the OR engine compute demand forecast and safety stock from full-sample statistics to avoid over-ordering while the pipeline digests. Methods chosen: L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend uses all available demand history and the capped ordering cap to balance service vs holding costs given large existing inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=1098, in-transit=0; confirmed historical lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals). Demand exhibits sustained higher regime since Period 5 per carry-over. Given high on-hand and need to reflect the newer demand regime while trusting confirmed lead time, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat using a recent_N forecast to focus on the higher recent demand (N=20) and set sigma_hat to default population estimate. These parameters keep ordering aligned to observed lead time and recent demand while avoiding overstating volatility.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier), and demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times (will equal 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting influence of very old low-demand samples; same recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) but rely on recent data to avoid overreacting to older low-demand history.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=931, in-transit=0. Recent weeks included a large spike (Period 45 demand=156) but existing carry-over already documents a prior sustained demand regime shift; no new sustained pattern detected. With very high on-hand and no pipeline, I choose conservative defaults so the OR backend uses historical sample statistics and the promised lead time: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default so (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) is used, sigma_hat=default so sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) is used. This avoids placing extra orders while on-hand inventory is ample, letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost.
