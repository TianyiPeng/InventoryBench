Current inventory position: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 351 (these in-transit units include recent large orders that will arrive during Period 39+ but are not visible until next conclude). Demand signal: recent sustained regime shift to higher demand (Periods 31\u201336 avg \u224869/week) with two very large demands in Periods 37\u201338 (102, 107), indicating an elevated-demand regime or a spike. OR baseline = 0 (it uses promised L and historical data but caps orders; it does not account for recent spike/lost arrivals). Risk assessment: pipeline of 351 may or may not be paced evenly across the next 4 arriving periods, and given the very high realized demands in P37\u201338, there is nontrivial stockout risk before our new order arrives. Objective: avoid lost sales while limiting holding cost. Decision: place a conservative replenishment of 100 units now to bolster the pipeline against continued high demand until our new order arrives (P43). This increases coverage of the (L+1)=5 period horizon without drastically inflating ending inventory if demand reverts.

Current visible state at Decision (Period 47): on-hand=0, in-transit=542 (these are orders placed P43\u2013P46 and will arrive during Period 47 arrival resolution, before demand). Recent demand regime: Periods 42\u201346 demand = [159, 85, 132, 177, 132], recent average \u2248137/week (note some sales were stock-limited). After the 542-unit arrival during Period 47, on-hand will be ~542 to satisfy Period 47 demand. To cover the full review+lead horizon (L+1 = 5 periods) we should plan for ~5 \xd7 137 \u2248 685 units. Current pipeline+on-hand after upcoming arrival = 542, so projected shortfall \u2248 143 units. OR recommends 0 (uses long-run historical mean ~50 and promised L); I override because demand has shifted up substantially and incoming pipeline will not fully cover the next 5 weeks. Order set slightly above the shortfall to provide a small buffer against variance. Final action: order 150 units.",
