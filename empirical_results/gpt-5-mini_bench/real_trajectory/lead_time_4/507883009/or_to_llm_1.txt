{

Uncapped order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline = 764 \u2212 532 = 232. OR returned 95 due to its cap; recent realized weekly demand has been below historical average (last 5 periods avg \u2248 68), but this appears to be short-term/seasonal noise around year-end and not a sustained regime shift meeting the 3+ period conservatism for carry-over. Given confirmed lead time = 4 and the desire to cover the full (L+1)=5-period exposure, I place the uncapped replenishment to bring pipeline up to the base-stock target (764), ordering 232 units. This balances stockout risk under the known 4-period lead with the risk/cost of holding extra units.",
