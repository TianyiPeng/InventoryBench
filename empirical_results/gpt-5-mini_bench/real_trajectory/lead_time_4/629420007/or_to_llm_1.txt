{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed L=4 (Periodic conclude messages show orders placed P1 arrived P5 etc.). Inventory: on-hand=445, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 41\u201346 and Dec dates) is very low (0\u20135 units/week, median ~2), consistent with sustained low season; historical summer spike is in past but current regime is low. OR recommends 272 using promised L and historical data; that recommendation ignores current high on-hand and recent low demand. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 future periods' demand. Even using a conservative per-period demand estimate of 5 units, 5\xd75=25 units suffice \u2014 far below current on-hand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4, so excess inventory is costly to carry. Therefore do not order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs; order quantity = 0.",
