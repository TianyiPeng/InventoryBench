Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show weekly mean = (119+73+98+97+113)/5 = 100.0 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current + lead periods. No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Use promised lead time and population stats: set L=default so backend uses promised 4; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances service (covering 5 periods of expected demand) versus holding cost given modest holding relative to profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=130 (Period1 ordered 130). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs. Recent demand observation (Period1 demand=147) is a single high value; not enough to declare a sustained regime shift. Use default lead time and default demand statistics (use full-sample mean/variance) so the OR engine computes base_stock based on historical samples and promised L. This balances service level (covers L+1 periods) while avoiding overreacting to one high demand point.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~100 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=279 (orders from P1+P2), no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed and shipments are not observed as arrived. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded lead-time evidence; use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR backend compute base stock while accounting for the full review+lead period. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods of demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=478. Recent realized demand in concluded periods: P1=147, P2=214, P3=181 \u2014 substantially above older historical weekly samples. No concluded arrivals for orders placed in P1-P3, so actual lead time is uncertain. I keep L at promised (default) because we have no concluded arrivals to reliably re-estimate lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (demands 147,214,181) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the latest regime, balancing service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 show arrived=0 despite being in-transit (ordered=130,149,199); sustained missing arrivals for 3 consecutive concluded periods \u2014 monitor for lost/delayed shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 Period 5. On-hand=0, in-transit=714 (orders from P1\u2013P4), but no concluded arrivals in P1\u2013P4 \u2014 sustained missing arrivals observed earlier; however no positive arrival confirms a different lead time yet. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01) avg=100, recent realized demand in P1\u2013P4 is elevated (147,214,181,110; avg=163) indicating a demand regime shift upward. I keep L as default (promised 4) because we lack confirmed alternate lead-time concludes. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the higher recent demand across the review+lead period. I use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the target base stock to meet higher realized demand while not yet altering lead-time assumptions until arrivals confirm a change or permanent loss.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed arrival: Period 5 conclude: 130 units from Period 1 with observed lead_time=4. Demand history (Jan\u2013Feb samples) has mean ~100 per period; recent realized weekly demands (110\u2013214) suggest continued typical demand without a clear upward regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=770 (large pipeline). Given the confirmed lead time and sizable pipeline, set L using observed lead times (calculate) and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so the OR engine uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and moderate profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has risen vs. the older sample set: recent six periods' demands (Periods1-6) average ~159 vs. historical sample mean 100 \u2014 a sustained uplift. On-hand=0, in-transit=621 (covers several outstanding orders; recent concludes confirm actual lead time=4). To capture the elevated recent demand I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=6). For L I use calculate so backend averages observed lead times (observed = 4,4 \u2192 4). These settings raise target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat_recent increases safety stock to guard against variability; using observed lead time prevents under-ordering given earlier delayed arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=640. Historical concludes show three confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) so actual lead time = 4. Pipeline appears delayed earlier but arrivals confirm shipments not lost. Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time average (4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging full historical demand mean=100 \u2192 default mu_hat=500 with L=4) to balance service level vs holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=580. Recent demand has accelerated (Periods 6-8: 160, 260, 311) indicating a higher recent regime. Observed lead times are consistently 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples to capture the new higher mean and volatility while keeping responsiveness to the upward trend. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the spike) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than the full historical mean.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-5 (confirmed lead time = 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=765 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals are only visible next period. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality; keep demand forecast and volatility as backend defaults using all samples (no strong sustained demand regime change detected). These parameters ensure the OR engine targets (1+L)-period coverage with service-level sizing while respecting holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=966. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed P5/P6/P7/P8/P9 arrivals). Demand has risen recently (Periods 7-10: 260,311,283,318) indicating a higher demand regime. To protect availability over the review+lead horizon while controlling holding cost, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times=4). Forecast demand using the most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 7-10) to capture the elevated regime for mu_hat and use the same 4-period window for sigma_hat to reflect higher variability. This biases orders upward to meet the recent spike while keeping variability-driven safety stock explicit to the OR engine.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=1085. Historical concluded lead times all equal 4 \u2192 confirm L=4. Recent demand (Periods 7-11: 260,311,283,318,396) shows a sustained, large upward shift vs. earlier sample mean (100). To capture the new regime, set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods. Volatility also appears higher recently, so estimate sigma_hat from the same 5 most recent samples. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while the OR cap still limits single-period receipts; using recent_N avoids understocking given delayed arrivals and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 7: avg demand rose from 100 (Periods in Jan-Feb baseline) to 313 (Periods 7-11) (+213%), sustained for 5 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1308. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand elevated since Period 7 (recent avg \u2248313 over P7\u2013P11) vs earlier baseline \u2248100; use recent data to capture this regime. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the length of the new high-demand regime) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most relevant regime, balancing higher service needs against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 7 (Periods 7\u201313 elevated). On-hand=178, in-transit=1337 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand, set demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime (use last 7 periods to estimate mean/variance). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=149, in-transit=1243. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals); no new lost-shipment signal. Recent demand has been volatile: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14) = [318,396,340,193,230], reflecting a higher recent mean but some decline from the earlier spike. To capture the most relevant recent demand level and variability while respecting confirmed lead time, I set L based on observed average lead time and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded orders with W=4) and a sustained demand increase starting Period 7 that was previously recorded. On-hand=227, in-transit=1147 (ample pipeline). To reflect confirmed lead time, use calculated average lead time. For demand forecast, recent demand appears elevated and variable; use a recent_N forecast (last 5 periods) to capture the post-shift regime while keeping responsiveness. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base stock tuned to the higher recent demand while the large in-transit inventory mitigates lost-shipment risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=408, in-transit=949. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; earlier missing arrivals resolved (multiple orders later arrived with W=4). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7; recent 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 12-16) average ~248/week. To capture current regime while keeping responsiveness to recent changes, use L=default (promised 4), mu_hat from recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand and in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods; historical demand rose starting Period 7 and has remained elevated. Current inventory (on-hand 648 + in-transit 549 = 1197) comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift higher-demand regime (Periods 13-17) so the backend sizes base-stock to service the new regime while limiting excess holding given $1/period cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=631, in-transit=442. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed arrive after 4 periods). Demand has been elevated vs. Jan-Feb baseline but has moderated recently (recent demands: P14-18 = 230,259,218,160,124; recent mean \u2248198). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent demand level, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the moderated post-spike regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the backend compute base_stock for a 1+L review+lead horizon with demand and variability anchored in the latest regime, balancing service (capture remaining demand) vs holding cost given large on-hand balance.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a demand regime shift occurred around Period 7 (higher demand mid-March\u2013April) but demand has moderated since May. On-hand = 737, in-transit = 223 (pipeline sizable); given high on-hand I will keep the promised lead time and use recent-window demand estimates to capture the post-shift demand profile while avoiding overreacting to short blips. L set to default (promised=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 (uses most recent 12 demand samples to reflect recent demand level/volatility while smoothing earlier regime spike). This balances service (captures elevated recent demand) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=829, in-transit=411. Past history shows actual lead time confirmed =4 (consistent arrivals at 4 periods). Recent demand (Periods 13-20) is lower than the earlier spike (Periods 7-11); I treat the most recent 8 concluded periods (P13\u2013P20) as the current demand regime to forecast the review+lead demand and volatility. Therefore keep L at default (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime and avoids excessive holding costs while preserving service.

Recent demand (Periods 13-21 = 193,230,259,218,160,124,135,109,81) shows a downward trend from the earlier spike; I rely on the most recent regime to avoid over-ordering given high on-hand.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has trended down (Periods 19-22: 135,109,81,54) after the high regime in Periods 7-16; however the decline is not yet a confirmed sustained regime shift. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=694, in-transit=411. No outstanding unexplained lost shipments in recent concludes (late missing arrivals from Periods1-4 were subsequently observed). To be conservative and stable, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies long-run sample statistics; this avoids overreacting to a short low-demand run while keeping service levels given substantial on-hand stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand surged in Periods 7-11 but has since returned to a lower regime: last 7 concluded demands (Periods 17-23) = [160,124,135,109,81,54,56], avg \u2248 104. On-hand=660 + in-transit=389 provides ample coverage vs current demand; no new prolonged losses observed. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the current low-demand regime so the OR backend reduces excess holding while maintaining service.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=1011, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple Pairs e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6...), and recent demand (Periods 17-24) averages ~99 units/week after the earlier Apr spike; no new sustained supply disruptions observed since lead time confirmations. Given current high on-hand and return to baseline demand, use promised lead time to keep policy stable and use recent_N (last 8 concluded demand samples, Periods 17-24) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current lower-variance regime and avoid overreacting to the April spike. This balances high service target (profit/holding => q=0.8) with holding cost risk from the large on-hand stock.

Date 2019-08-12. Summer-demand has fallen vs spring spike: recent 6 demands (Periods 21-26) = [81,54,56,38,43,25], mean=49.5. On-hand=943, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock, so no aggressive replenishment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has fallen to summer lows (Periods 21-27 demands: 81,54,56,38,43,25,38) after a high-demand regime in Periods 7-16. On-hand is very high (905) and in-transit=0; several prior shipments confirmed lead time=4. Given high inventory and confirmed LT=4, avoid aggressive up-weighting for forecast\u2014use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample). This keeps orders small/zero and minimizes holding cost while preserving service level if demand reverts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=885, in-transit=81; recent concluded history shows sustained low weekly demand since Period 17 (many small sales, several zero-arrival periods earlier resolved). Promised lead time is 4 and recent concluded arrivals confirm LT=4 historically, so keep L as default (promised). To reflect the clear, sustained drop in demand since Period 17 I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (Period 17\u201328) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the low-demand regime; this reduces ordering compared with using the full-sample mean and limits holding cost while retaining service for current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg demand fell from 313.6 (Periods 7\u201311) to 73.6 (Periods 17\u201328), a -76% drop, sustained for 12 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Demand has entered and sustained a low regime since Period 17 (recent weekly demand mean \u224841 over P21\u2013P29). To reflect confirmed lead time and the sustained low-demand regime, set L based on observed average lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent samples from the low-demand regime (to avoid overstocking given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4). This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding costs by sizing forecasts to the recent low-demand regime rather than earlier high-demand periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand is in the low regime that began at Period 17 (mean ~73.6 historically); the last 14 concluded periods (P17\u2013P30) show consistently low weekly demand (range ~11\u2013160 with recent weeks 13,11). On-hand = 861, in-transit = 81 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand, so avoid over-ordering. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in past concluded messages. I use: L='calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time (expected ~4); mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the recent low-demand regime to reflect current demand levels and lower volatility (recent_N with N=14 covers P17\u2013P30). This reduces order quantities and holding cost while maintaining service for the sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 17 (demands ~13\u2013160 earlier but mostly single/double digits recent), and confirmed actual lead time = 4 in prior conclusions. On-hand = 848, in-transit = 81 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to recent low demand, so keep promised lead time. I set L to use the default (promised) 4. For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast on the sustained low-demand regime spanning Periods 17\u201331 (regime length 15), so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from those recent samples. This reduces ordering to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): on-hand=921, in-transit=0; recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (Periods 17\u201332 mean ~ ~? but clearly much lower than earlier spike). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods in history (consistent arrivals with W=4). Given the sustained low-demand regime starting Period 17 (12+ periods) I use recent_N for demand forecast to reflect the current lower mean and volatility. I select N=16 to cover Periods 17\u201332 (regime length ~16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the most relevant samples; L uses default (promised) = 4. These choices reduce overstating demand (and excess holding cost) while preserving service given confirmed 4-period lead time and no in-transit units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=912, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods and recent concluded arrivals match L=4. Demand has been in a low regime since mid-late summer (Periods 25\u201333: demands = 38,25,38,20,13,11,13,8,9), so I base forecasts on the most recent observations to avoid overstocking. I select L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time, mu_hat recent_N using last 9 samples to capture the current low-demand regime, and sigma_hat recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordered quantity versus earlier high-demand periods, preserving profit by avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07): demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (sustained ~73.6 avg through Period 34). On-hand is high (909) and in-transit=0, no outstanding arrivals expected. Actual lead time was previously confirmed as 4; no recent evidence to change it. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the entire low-demand regime to avoid overshooting replenishment while on-hand is already large: mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=18 (regime length Periods 17\u201334 = 18 samples). This keeps the (1+L) forecast tied to the current low-demand regime and the volatility estimate aligned to recent variability, which helps the OR backend reduce ordering given high on-hand inventory and higher holding cost relative to profit.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (avg \u2248 teens), inventory high (on-hand=906, in-transit=0) after previous arrivals; lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4. To avoid over-ordering I set L to calculate (use observed lead times=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=19) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201335) so mu_hat reflects current low demand, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=19) to capture volatility in the same regime. This reduces forecasted replenishment relative to using all historical samples and prevents excess holding cost while maintaining service given confirmed lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=902, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 17 (sustained drop); recent weekly demand very low (single-digit in latest weeks). To avoid excessive holding cost given large on-hand stock and sustained low demand, set lead time by observed history and use recent-demand estimates over the current low-demand regime (capture last 20 periods of the regime). Methods: L set to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time ~4; mu_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to reflect reduced volatility in the same window. These choices reduce ordering (given high on-hand) while matching the low recent demand and confirmed lead time, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=897, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (sustained drop to ~10/week); recent weeks show very low demand (3\u201313). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand stock and sustained low demand, keep promised lead time and forecast off the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (promised=4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Period 18\u201337 \u2248 20 samples capped at 20) so the OR engine will target much lower replenishment and reduce holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (weekly demand mostly 3\u201343, recently 3\u201313); on-hand is high (892) and in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time; no new sustained lead-time change. To avoid overstocking versus service risk, set lead time to default (promised=4) and estimate demand using the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (periods 17\u201336+), and match sigma to recent volatility over the same window so the backend\u2019s base-stock balances service vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been very low (single- to low-double-digit weekly sales since Period 21) and on-hand inventory is high (888) with no in-transit units. Historical sample mean from Jan\u2013Feb is 100 (used by default policy). There are no newly confirmed lead-time changes since lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 in concluded history. Given large on-hand stock and no outstanding arrivals, I keep the backend defaults so the OR engine uses promised L and historical demand moments; this avoids overreacting to short-term low demand while allowing the OR engine's cap to limit new orders. No flagged overdue shipments.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a low, stable regime since Period 17 (weekly demand mostly 3\u201313). On-hand = 885, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent data: use recent_N = 20 (captures the long low-demand regime since Period 17). Use the same recent_N = 20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock aligned with the current low-demand regime while acknowledging confirmed lead time and avoiding unnecessary replenishment given high on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has collapsed and stabilized at very low weekly levels (Periods 29\u201341 avg \u2248 ~8\u21922 units/week; last 6 periods demand: 5,5,4,3,3,2). On-hand is high (883) and in-transit=0; several prior shipments were delayed but lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. Given large on-hand buffer versus current low demand, avoid aggressive ordering. Use promised lead time (default) and let OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full history (default) so base-stock calculation and cap limit ordering automatically. This balances service vs holding cost given high inventory and confirmed LT=4 in history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 17 (avg ~73.6) with stable arrivals (lead time confirmed as 4). On-hand=879, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs current low weekly demand (few units/week). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I select recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (capture most recent 26-period low regime, capped at 20). I keep L=default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm 4-period lead time. These settings lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given long on-hand balance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=879, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 repeatedly and long-run demand regime collapsed since Period 17 (sustained low demand through Period 43). No recent arrivals are overdue. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent low-demand periods (capable of reducing future ordering and holding costs). This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory and low recent demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand is high (876) and in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (sustained low weekly demand ~0\u201313), so forecast should use recent samples from the low-demand regime. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new evidence to change it. To keep orders conservative given high on-hand and low demand, use promised/default lead time and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent low-demand regime (most recent N=20 periods) so the OR backend targets appropriate base stock and low cap orders, limiting holding cost exposure while preserving service.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 17 (single-digit weekly sales); on-hand is high (875) and in-transit=0, so focus on avoiding excess holding. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history, so keep promised lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent data from the low-demand regime: take the last N=20 periods to capture the sustained low-demand behavior and reduce forecast to current reality. This reduces order quantities and holding cost while preserving service for the low demand level.

Lead time historically observed = 4 repeatedly. To avoid over-ordering given large on-hand and very low recent demand, keep promised lead time and use recent-demand estimates. L: use default (promised 4). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime and scale by (1+L). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent low volatility.
