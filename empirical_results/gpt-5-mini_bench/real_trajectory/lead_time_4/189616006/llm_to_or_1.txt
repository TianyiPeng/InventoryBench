Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward shift (samples: 2019-01-07:37, 01-14:95, 01-21:121, 01-28:153, 02-04:145). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods. I use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer an alternate L. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained rising regime across the five available weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the higher recent mean while keeping variability estimates aligned with recent data, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-14\u20132019-02-04: mean of first two weeks (2019-01-07,01-14)=66 units/week vs mean of last three weeks (2019-01-21,01-28,02-04)=139.7 units/week (+111%), sustained for 3+ periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=188 (order placed in P1 still not arrived per Period 1 conclude). Historical weekly samples show a sustained demand regime shift: weeks 2019-01-21\u21922019-02-04 average \u2248139.7 vs earlier weeks \u224866 (+~111%), so I use the recent high-demand regime for forecasting. I keep L=default (promised 4) because no concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N, N=3 to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 3 high-demand weeks, which raises target base-stock to meet the higher regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weeks show a sustained demand regime shift (noted in carry-over): recent weekly mean \u2248139.7 vs earlier 66. On-hand=0, in-transit=348 units. Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 have not arrived), so actual lead time is unconfirmed; missing arrivals may indicate delays or loss but not yet sustained for inference. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this lets the backend combine historical demand (including the detected regime shift) with its service-level cap while avoiding premature manual adjustments given unconfirmed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=554; three consecutive conclude messages show no arrivals for prior orders (possible delays/lost shipments) but no concluded arrivals to confirm a lead-time change, so keep L at promised. Demand history shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-sample mean \u2248139.7 > full-sample mean (110.2). I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent demand (N chosen = 3 because the detected regime length is 3 weeks). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast to better cover upcoming demand; keeping L=default avoids overcorrecting for unconfirmed lead-time changes while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=762 (many units outstanding; no concluded arrivals observed yet but promised lead time=4). Recent realized weekly demands (Periods 1\u20134) = [135,191,132,140], mean \u2248149.5 reflecting the previously recorded higher-demand regime. I retain promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals allow confirming a different actual lead time. I set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 weeks to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (recent_N, N=4). I set sigma_hat using recent volatility over the same recent 4-week window (recent_N, N=4). These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the confirmed higher demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand shows a lower regime than the initial spike: last 3 observed demands = 132, 140, 125 (mean \u2248132.3/week). On-hand=63, in-transit=574 => pipeline=637. Promised lead time=4; Period 5 conclude confirms at least one arrival with lead_time=4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend confirm the realized average (single observed lead_time=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (last 3 periods), multiplied by (1+L) in backend. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. This keeps stock aligned with the current lower-demand regime while accounting for the long lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand regime is elevated vs early samples; last 5 observed weekly demands (P2\u2013P6) average 139.8/week, consistent with prior carry-over regime shift. On-hand=112 + in-transit=439 => pipeline=551, ample coverage vs forecast but some in-transit arrived recently so continue to use observed lead time. Set L by calculation of observed lead times (both concluded arrivals show 4), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean uses the last 5 samples), and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These parameters align the backend base-stock toward the higher recent mean while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence; given large pipeline this avoids unnecessary new orders while maintaining service level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5\u20137) = [125, 111, 110], showing a stable elevated regime vs earlier low values. On-hand=208, in-transit=381 (no overdue shipments visible). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmations. For demand I use a recent_N (N=3) forecast using the last 3 realized weekly demands to capture the current stable regime; mu_hat thus targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility. These settings align pipeline cover to (1+L) periods of demand while avoiding excess holding given unit profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=300, in-transit=173. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and recent weekly demand has been roughly stable near ~110-125 units. Given ample on-hand + pipeline and no new sustained demand or lead-time shifts, use default methods so OR backend applies promised L=4 and demand estimates from full sample history; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting the OR engine compute base_stock and caps.

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history. To reflect the recent lower post-regime demand (changepoint detected earlier) and to keep the OR engine focused on current demand, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over the most recent 5 observations and recent volatility. L uses the promised/default lead time (4) consistent with observed confirmations. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given sizable on-hand+pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs early Jan (historic shift noted). Current on-hand=137, in-transit=319 (pipeline healthy); no obvious lost shipments since lead time confirmations. Use observed lead time evidence and recent demands to forecast across review+lead. Set L via recent observed lead times (confirmed 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on last 6 demand observations (captures current ~110/week regime and reduces influence of early low values). This balances service (cover (1+L) periods) while avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has fallen materially vs the earlier high regime (recent demands P9\u2013P12 = 91,97,74,73). On-hand=138 + in-transit=277 => pipeline=415, which already covers multiple weeks (5-period demand coverage target). Lead time has been confirmed repeatedly as 4 periods in concluded messages; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. I detect a sustained demand regime shift to a lower mean over the last 4 concluded periods (Periods 9\u201312), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples to capture the new lower mean and reduced volatility. These parameters reduce excess holding while preserving service for the confirmed L=4 lead time and the 5-period replenishment horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 9 (2019-04-08\u20132019-04-29): avg demand dropped from ~140 (Periods 3\u20138) to 83.75 (Periods 9\u201312, mean of 91,97,74,73) \u2014 sustained 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 9 (2019-04-08) \u2014 periods 9\u201313 demands = [91,97,74,73,54], recent regime length = 5 with lower mean (~77.8). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Set L to promised (default=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower regime across the review+lead horizon (1+L periods = 5). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect volatility in the new regime. This balances lower target base-stock to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed lower-demand regime and known 4-period lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (2019-04-08) \u2014 avg demand fell from ~140 to ~84 and has persisted for 6 periods (P9\u2013P14). On-hand=183, in-transit=134; past concludes confirm actual lead time=4. I set L=default (promised/confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (covers P9\u2013P14) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 6 weeks. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding while preserving service for the current lower-demand environment.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (demands: 91,97,74,73,54,72,50) vs earlier ~140; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=219 + in-transit=116 provides cushion vs (1+L) demand, but demand has downshifted so use recent data. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current low-demand regime (N equals detected regime length=7). This focuses orders on the new lower mean and recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): confirmed lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals. Recent demand has remained in the lower regime since Period 9 (recent demands P9\u2013P16 = 91,97,74,73,54,72,50,48; 8 samples) so I use a recent-window forecast. On-hand=191 and in-transit=126 provide ample pipeline; no shipments appear lost. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and recent volatility, which will lower target base-stock and reduce holding cost while preserving service for the current demand level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has settled much lower than early-year levels: last 5 weekly demands (Periods 13\u201317) = 54,72,50,48,53 (mean=55.4), down from prior ~140. On-hand=142, in-transit=155 (total pipeline 297) \u2014 no obvious overdue shipments and lead time previously confirmed as 4. I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new lower demand regime (5-period recent regime evidence above). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base_stock to match the sustained lower demand, lowering holding cost while maintaining service on current demand level.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-06-17. On-hand=130, in-transit=131 (total pipeline=261). No overdue arrivals visible in conclude history; lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded messages. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 9; last 10 demands (P9\u2013P18) average 64.8/wk, so I use recent_N=10 to capture the sustained drop. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms L=4. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) makes the OR backend set base-stock to cover the current lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 9 (2019-04-08) \u2014 weekly demand mostly in the 30\u2013100 range, recent weeks ~35\u201353 and on-hand=163, in-transit=126. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I therefore use the promised/default lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-Period-9 lower regime; regime length is 11 periods (P9\u2013P19) so N=11. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the current lower-mean, lower-volatility regime, reducing excess holding while maintaining service.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=173 + in-transit=118 = 291 vs expected (1+L) demand horizon; promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To target current lower-demand regime while protecting service, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base_stock to the 5-period demand forecast based on the recent lower mean and recent volatility. This reduces excess holding from earlier high-demand regime while maintaining availability given confirmed 4-period lead times.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has remained in the lower regime confirmed earlier (Periods 9\u201322 average much lower than early 2019). On-hand=145, in-transit=85 \u2192 pipeline=230. With promised L=4 (confirmed historically), (1+L)=5 so pipeline covers ~5 periods. I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N to focus the estimate on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 9\u201322): mu_hat recent_N N=14 (captures the 14 most recent samples since the demand drop) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of those recent samples. For volatility I use recent_N N=14 to reflect recent variance. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the sustained lower-demand regime while the pipeline prevents stockouts; it avoids overstock from older high-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-114.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand has fallen well below earlier regimes: last 5 demands (Periods 19\u201323) = [35,20,21,40,47], avg \u2248 32.6/week. On-hand 161 + in-transit 65 = 226 units \u2014 ample coverage vs very low recent demand, but avoid overstock. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. I choose L=default to use promised 4; mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect reduced recent volatility. This tightens ordering to match the sustained lower demand and reduces holding losses given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 19: avg demand over Periods 19\u201323 = 32.6/week vs prior Periods 9\u201318 avg \u2248 64.8/week (\u221249.7%), sustained 5 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (avg \u224832.6/week over P19\u2013P23) persists through P24; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods historically. On-hand=155 + in-transit=43 \u2192 pipeline=198, which covers multiple weeks at the current low demand. To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime I use recent_N on demand mean/volatility (captures the reduced (1+L)-period demand and lower variability). I keep L=default (promised 4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 4 and backend expects promised LT. These choices steer the OR engine toward a much lower base-stock aligned with the new lower-demand regime, reducing holding costs while maintaining service given current pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the lower regime identified earlier (Period 19 onward). Last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 21\u201325) = [21,40,47,28,63], mean \u2248 39.8/wk. On-hand 92 + in-transit 43 = 135 units, which is below coverage for (1+L)=5 weeks at the recent mean (\u2248199 units), so the OR engine should top up. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use the promised/default L. To make the forecast responsive to the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N, N=5); this focuses the base-stock on the low-demand regime and limits excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=3, in-transit=107 (pipeline ample but arrivals observed with confirmed 4-period lead time historically). Recent weekly demand (Periods 22\u201326): [40,47,28,63,89] shows volatility with a recent uptick but no sustained new regime (needs 3+ periods of consistent shift to record). I set L by calculating observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 4), to align forecasting with realized supplier behavior. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the (1+L)-period demand forecast responsive to the latest demand volatility and uptick; this reduces risk of overstocking from older high-demand regimes while keeping service through the pipeline. These params balance holding cost = profit by using a short recent sample to keep base-stock moderate given current low on-hand and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=157. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has risen over the last 5 periods (47,28,63,89,105) suggesting a higher short-term mean than the low mid-year regime. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed = 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime; this biases orders upward to cover the current spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to avoid stockouts given in-transit only 157 and zero on-hand, while keeping holding exposure limited by using a short recent window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has risen (Periods 25-28: 63,89,105,101) after earlier low regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=275 (covers multiple future periods but arrivals unobserved until conclude). Historical concluded arrivals show stable lead time=4 periods. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (avg=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime (captures the recent uptick) and scale variability to recent volatility; this lets the OR engine target a base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding overreaction to older high/low regimes. These choices balance service (higher recent demand) and holding cost given significant in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has rebounded vs the low regime observed around Periods 19\u201323; last 5 demands (Periods 25\u201329) = [63,89,105,101,72], mean\u224886. On-hand=0, in-transit=386 which approximately covers ~4.5 weeks at this recent mean (386\u22485\xd786), so pipeline is sizable. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods. I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to make the OR engine target the recent higher-demand regime while reflecting elevated short-term volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given strong in-transit) against holding cost by relying on recent sample-driven base stock and volatility estimates.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09).

On-hand=0, in-transit=366 (pipeline coverage ample but arrivals occur with 4-period lead historically). Use promised/default lead time to match supplier promise and historical confirms. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the recent higher-demand regime and higher volatility; this focuses ordering on the current demand level while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost since pipeline is already large.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=335. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Recent demand (Periods 26\u201331 = 89,105,101,72,83,99) represents a sustained higher regime since Period 26. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new regime (covering the 6 most recent weeks) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the post-Period-26 uplift while limiting exposure to older low-demand weeks. The chosen parameters ensure pipeline + on-hand target covers (L+1) periods of the recent demand regime given current in-transit stock, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg demand Periods 26\u201331 = 91.5/week vs prior Periods 19\u201323 avg = 32.6/week (+181%), sustained 6 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=33, in-transit=330 \u2014 sizable pipeline but recent demand regime (Periods 26\u201331) rose sharply and is the most relevant predictor. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will reinforce 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201331) when forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This focuses inventory on the current higher-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders; given profit=holding, the service-level tradeoff uses these recent estimates to avoid stockouts during the high regime while limiting excess holding.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=18, in-transit=311 (sizable pipeline). I keep L as default (promised = 4, confirmed by prior concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent elevated regime to capture the higher mean and volatility (N=6 covers Periods 28\u201333/26\u201331 regime length evidence). This balances service (avoid stockouts during the elevated regime) against holding cost given large pipeline: recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on current regime rather than long-run average.

Set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples to capture the current demand level and volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet (1+L) review+lead demand while avoiding excess holding.

Recent demand (Periods 30\u201335: 83,99,85,126,100,67) suggests a higher post-regime mean around ~93/week but with volatility; I use a recent_N=6 sample to capture the latest regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the most recent demand level and variability, balancing service (profit=holding cost) while avoiding excess inventory given pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weekly demand has rebounded into the ~80\u2013130 range (most recent 5 demands: 85,126,100,67,75; mean\u224890.6). On-hand=38, in-transit=354 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime while respecting the promised lead time and avoiding stockouts given long lead time, set L to default (promised=4). Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest regime: (1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks \u2248 5*90.6. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock tuned to the current higher-demand regime while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand (Periods 33\u201338 = 126,100,67,75,94,82) averages \u224890.7/week \u2014 a moderate regime around 70\u2013125 units. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=80 + in-transit=294 => pipeline=374, which is likely below the (1+L)-period demand requirement given recent mean (~5\xd790.7\u2248453), so orders will still be needed. I set L to default (use promised lead time 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (6 periods of consistent behavior) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets service for the current lower-than-peak regime while reflecting recent variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=126, in-transit=274 (total pipeline=400) \u2014 adequate coverage vs recent demand but avoid excess holding given holding cost = profit. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand has shown multiple regime shifts; to capture the current higher recent demand (Periods 33\u201339 = 126,100,67,75,94,82,54) I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (captures the most recent regime while smoothing older shifts). These parameters provide the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand estimate focused on the latest regime, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so keep L as default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and to ensure pipeline + on-hand covers (1+L) periods of expected demand (5\xd7~71=355), which current inventory/pipeline (~374) roughly matches, balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=114, in-transit=205 (pipeline=319). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2192 use promised/default L=4. Recent demand (Periods 36\u201341: 75,94,82,54,54,55) indicates a lower regime (~70/week); with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 weeks. To target service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use a recent-window demand estimate: mu_hat from recent_N (N=6) to capture the current ~70/wk regime; sigma_hat from recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the most recent regime and accounts for observed on-hand + in-transit shortfall versus a 5-week demand forecast.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent weeks show a holiday-era demand uptick (Period 42 demand=129) after generally mid-range weekly demand. On-hand=82 + in-transit=134 => pipeline=216 units which is below coverage for a 5-period review+lead horizon given recent demand. Lead times in concluded history are consistently 4 periods; use calculated average to confirm. To capture the recent upward regime (including the 129 spike) I use recent_N=8 for demand mean/volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest regime and keep safety stock responsive.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly demand is variable but no new sustained regime shift since prior carry-overs; concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. On-hand=116 + in-transit=173 provides coverage vs (1+L) demand, so use the promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. I choose L=default to keep lead-time = promised (historical concludes confirm 4), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given stable long-run regimes and avoids overreacting to recent noise.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand (Periods 36\u201344) = [75,94,82,54,54,55,129,46,45], recent mean \u2248 70.44/week. On-hand=99, in-transit=276 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=375 units (~5.32 weeks at recent mean). Historical concluded lead time consistently 4 periods. I select L=default (promised 4) because concluded evidence repeatedly confirms 4 and no loss pattern visible. To reflect recent lower-season demand with one spike, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (last 9 weeks) so the OR backend targets inventory for the current regime and reduces overstock risk while keeping service. These parameters balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5 (OR engine will target median); using recent data steers orders to current demand.

Period 45 had a one-off large spike (demand=356) likely holiday-driven but not yet a sustained regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost I use short recent window to adapt to elevated recent variability while keeping L at promised value so OR backend models lead time reliably. I choose recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 6 weeks (including the spike) so the base-stock will increase to improve service for potential continued high demand; L uses default promised lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand shows a large, likely holiday spike (Period 45 demand=356, P46=180) but those are not yet a sustained regime (many sales were constrained by stockouts). Lead time has consistently observed =4 in concluded history; use promised/default. To remain responsive to recent upward pressure while not overreacting to a possibly transient spike, I use an EWMA forecast for the (1+L)-period demand (gamma=0.3) so recent high demand moves the forecast upward smoothly. Keep sigma at default to reflect overall historical volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=545 provides substantial pipeline cover; these parameters steer the OR engine toward moderate additional ordering to balance service vs holding cost.
