Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks): [6,4,20,14,18], mean=12.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. No concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) L=4. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to reflect full review+lead demand (5*12.4=62.0) and default sigma_hat to reflect observed variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level given profit/holding costs while avoiding unsupported explicit overrides.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=25 (order placed Period 1 has not concluded yet). Historical weekly demand samples: [6,4,20,14,18], mean=12.4. No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time; single non-arrival is expected given promised lead time=4. Use default lead time (promised L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given provided profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=53. No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-2 so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Recent concluded demands (P1=24, P2=29) are well above historical weekly mean (12.4), so use an EWMA to give weight to these recent high demands while retaining historical signal. Choose gamma=0.5 to balance responsiveness and stability. Use default sigma (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) because there is insufficient sustained evidence of a volatility regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly mean demand = 12.4 (samples: 6,4,20,14,18). Promised lead time = 4. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 weeks \u2192 default (1+L)*mean = 62 units. Current pipeline (in-transit=93) comfortably exceeds that forecast; no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs. Use defaults for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute base-stock; this avoids ordering given ample pipeline and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent observed demand shows a clear upward regime: demands in Periods 1-4 = {24,29,95,174} vs historical sample mean ~12.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=168 (orders P1-P4 sum =168) but no concluded arrivals yet. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (avoid prematurely declaring lost shipments before arrivals can conclude). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 4 samples) and for sigma use recent_N (N=4) to reflect increased volatility. This raises base-stock to meet the sustained demand spike while sigma increases the safety stock; keeping L=promised avoids overcompensating for potentially delayed but not-yet-confirmed lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1: recent avg demand (P1-P4)=80.5 vs historical avg ~12.4 (+548%); No concluded arrivals for orders placed P1-P4 (in-transit=168), possible shipment delays/losses to monitor.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime: P1-P4 demands = [24,29,95,174], recent mean = 80.5/week (sharp shift vs earlier historical samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=340 (no immediate available stock). Period 5 conclude shows an arrival for an order placed in P1 with observed lead_time=4, so actual lead time aligns with promised 4. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 4 periods where the shift is evident) and reduce dilution from older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability. These choices target (1+L) periods coverage of the new regime while keeping safety stock responsive to elevated variance; this balances service level given high stockouts so far vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted up sharply since Period 3 (demands P3-P6 = 95,174,254,173) \u2014 I treat the most recent high-demand regime (P3-P6) as the forecasting basis. On-hand=0, in-transit=611 (large pipeline currently). Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time ~4. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (will average observed values). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 4 periods). For volatility I also use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the new higher demand while the large in-transit reduces additional ordering urgency, balancing service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order P1 arrived P5, order P2 arrived P6)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher (concluded demands P1-P7 = 24,29,95,174,254,173,243) versus historical samples (Jan 2019 mean ~12.4). Lead time has been observed as 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times and use recent_N for demand stats using the recent 7 concluded periods (regime length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new high mean and volatility. This balances service (capture large demand) against holding cost by sizing base-stock to the elevated (1+L)-period demand and measured variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has jumped and remained high in the last 4 concluded periods (P5-P8 demands = 254,173,243,578; recent avg=312). On-hand=0, in-transit=812 provides large pipeline but some earlier shipments were delayed before confirming LT=4. Use promised lead time (default) since LT=4 is confirmed in history. Forecast demand using the most recent 4 periods to capture the new high-demand regime; likewise estimate volatility from those same 4 samples so OR backend sets base stock to protect service while balancing holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward and sustained high levels (recent demands: P6=173, P7=243, P8=578, P9=216). On-hand=0, in-transit=1225 (pipeline large but arrivals have historically matched promised 4-period lead time). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture confirmed lead_time=4. For demand, I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (weights recent large samples) and set sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to reflect increased volatility. These choices produce a (1+L)-period forecast based on the most recent regime so the OR backend will raise base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while sigma from recent samples drives appropriate safety stock given higher variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Demand has shifted to a sustained high regime (recent avg \u2248196.9 over last 10 periods). Promised lead time is 4 and actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history, so use the default promised L. On-hand=116 and in-transit=1535 provide large pipeline cover, but high demand persists so set mu_hat using the recent 10-period mean scaled by (1+L)=5 to capture current regime; set sigma_hat using recent 10 periods to reflect current volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to prioritize service (profit>holding) while sigma reflects observed variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand regime is much higher than historical (sustained spike from Period 5 onward). Current on-hand=259, in-transit=1254 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N=7 (Periods 5-11) for demand mean and volatility (regime length=7). This emphasizes recent high demand for base-stock while sigma from recent samples captures current variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-06 (Period 13). Current inventory: on-hand=132, in-transit=1260. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.); demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 1 (many periods of large weekly demand). To capture confirmed lead time use calculated average from observed lead times. For demand forecasting use recent data only to reflect the new high-demand regime: use recent_N over the last 12 observed demand samples (Periods 1\u201312) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large demand) while allowing the OR engine to cap orders via its internal cap.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent observed lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand=615, in-transit=650 (healthy coverage). Recent demand (Periods 9-13) has stabilized around ~165 units/week (216,183,138,162,127). To reflect the current regime while keeping responsiveness to recent actual demand, set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last five realized demands. This focuses the OR engine on the current demand level, reducing excess safety stock from older low-volume samples while keeping a conservative variance estimate for service level decisions.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=1107, in-transit=41. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained high-demand regime in recent periods (multiple periods with demand >> historical sample set). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 8 demand observations to capture the new high-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N N=8, sigma_hat recent_N N=8). This raises the base-stock to reflect current demand while sigma from recent data captures elevated volatility; using recent stats mitigates stockouts given confirmed lead time and large recent demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead time, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 demand observations (captures current elevated mean and variance).

Recent realized demand (Periods 13-16) avg \u2248164 units/week; demand remains in the elevated regime vs pre-Period5 history. To maintain service while limiting holding cost, keep promised lead time and set mu_hat to cover (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean (5\xd7164=820). I set sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility: estimated per-period std \u224867.74 \u2192 sigma_hat = sqrt(5)\xd767.74 \u2248151.5.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=611, in-transit=546 (total pipeline=1157) which is ample vs. elevated recent demand. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 and multiple high-demand periods since Period 1 (sustained regime). I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime, so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest demand mean/variance; N=8 captures the most recent sustained regime while respecting the N selection rules. These parameters raise base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while avoiding excess long-term holding by relying on recent volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods. To avoid over-ordering given high inventory and holding cost, use promised/observed lead time and broad historical demand estimates: set L to default (promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) so base-stock reflects long-run demand sample estimates while the capped order will limit shipment sizes; this balances service vs holding given our substantial on-hand + in-transit and prior shipment variability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent realized demand has shifted up vs early historical samples: recent five-week demands are large (P15-P19 = 281,131,125,96,142) and on-hand is high (612) with 307 in-transit; past concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Use promised/default lead time to match observed confirmations. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher regime (reduces stockouts risk vs global historical mean). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps order targets aligned to current demand while the OR backend will cap orders; no new evidence of lost shipments since LT=4 confirmed.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=817, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 13-20) = [127,117,281,131,125,96,142,102], recent mean=140.125. Confirmed lead time historically = 4 periods. I choose L=default (promised 4). For demand I detect a stable recent regime over the last 8 periods (N=8) and set mu_hat recent_N to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on this regime; (1+L)=5 so implied forecast \u22485\xd7140.125. Demand volatility likewise estimated from the same 8 recent samples (sigma_hat recent_N N=8). This keeps inventory aligned to current lower post-spike demand while preserving service given confirmed 4-period lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=672, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time and demand has moderated from the early spike back toward historical levels. No overdue shipments visible. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=4, consistent with concluded evidence). For demand I choose mu_hat=default to anchor to the long-run sample mean (1+L)*mean_all_samples = 5*12.4 = 62, which is conservative given recent normalization and helps avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4. For uncertainty I choose sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These default choices balance service (profit/hazard ratio) against current high on-hand inventory and known 4-period lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in history; use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat using recent 8-week mean scaled by (1+L)=5 to capture current regime (5*146.75\u2248733.8) so orders align with current demand, while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent realized weekly demand has settled well above the historical early-2019 samples: recent 8-period mean (P16\u2013P23) \u2248133.8 units/week vs historical mean \u224812.4. Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in prior concludes. On-hand=343 and in-transit=323 provide ample coverage, but demand regime is persistently higher so forecast should use recent data. I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand samples; this tightens the forecast to current demand and helps the OR backend compute an appropriate base stock balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=239, in-transit=376. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime is substantially higher than the small-sample historical (older samples mean ~12.4); recent weeks show sustained weekly demand around 100\u2013300. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and preserve service while limiting excess holding, set L to promised (default) since lead time is confirmed, and use recent_N=20 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base stock from the most relevant recent demand statistics.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=78, in-transit=734. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline + on-hand is large relative to recent demand, so keep promised lead time. Use recent demand (last 8 weeks) to capture current regime (recent weekly demand ~100-177) for both mean and volatility to avoid overreacting to earlier extreme spikes. This balances service (use recent demand to size base stock) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=129, in-transit=488 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated lead time. Demand stabilized after the early spike (regime shift flagged Period 5); recent weeks (roughly P19\u2013P26) show moderately high weekly demand (~100\u2013195). I choose recent_N with N=8 to capture the current demand regime while dampening older extreme spikes. Using recent demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service (covering (1+L) periods of current demand) against holding cost given large on-hand/pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=16, in-transit=592. Historical/conclude messages show sustained high-demand regime since early periods (recent weekly demand ~150-195) and lead time consistently observed = 4 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, set L by calculating observed lead times; set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 10 demand samples to reflect the new regime while smoothing older low-demand history. These parameters prioritize service (reduce stockouts given large in-transit and high demand) while relying on recent variance to control excess holding.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime vs the Jan baseline: recent weekly demand ~150\u2013195 (multiple periods P21\u2013P28) after the earlier surge; on-hand=0, in-transit=732. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. To keep pipeline sufficient for the (1+L) review+lead period while reflecting the new higher-demand regime, I use default lead time (promised 4), and recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 8 demand observations (captures the current regime length and volatility). This increases target base-stock to meet service without overreacting to single-week spikes; using recent data also helps the OR backend avoid understocking given observed sustained demand increase and existing in-transit units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows steady demand regime since Period 1 with confirmed lead time = 4 (concludes P5/P6/P7/P8 etc.). Current on-hand=232, in-transit=496 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs historical (sample mean=12.4 wk). Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes support it, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the OR engine calibrated to long-run sample stats while leveraging confirmed L=4 and avoids overreacting to short-term noise given large pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding costs given high on-hand/pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weekly demand has settled in the 100-200 range after an earlier large spike; current on-hand=73, in-transit=682. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Given ample pipeline and confirmed LT=4, use promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This preserves service (covers (1+L) periods) while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods historically; use promised/confirmed lead time. To size replenishment to current demand regime, use recent_N=5 for mean and volatility (captures the most recent stable regime). This yields (1+L)-scaled demand forecast and volatility over the last 5 weeks, while using default lead time to match confirmed behavior and avoid reacting to transient noise.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=179, in-transit=494. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Historical sample mean (~12.4) is stale\u2014a sustained higher-demand regime was previously detected (recent avg >> historical). To ensure service while controlling holding cost: keep L at promised (default) since concluded lead times = 4; set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the recent high-demand regime (N=20) so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of current demand; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend up-to-date mean/variance over the review+lead window, producing a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while z* (driven by profit/holding) limits excessive overstock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand is in a higher regime (last 5 demands: 126,159,131,137,177; mean=146) vs historical pre-shift mean ~12.4. To capture the sustained elevated demand and keep service while avoiding excessive holding, set L to promised/default (4), set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean = 5\xd7146, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 27-34) shows elevated, sustained demand vs early-sample mean; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (matches confirmed 4). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=8 (periods 27-34) so (1+L)*mean reflects current higher demand and avoids dilution from early low samples. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend computes a base-stock aligned to the current high-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead-time; high pipeline reduces immediate order needs and helps avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand has been elevated historically since Period 1 but recent conclude messages show consistent arrivals with actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6, and many subsequent 4-period arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=299, in-transit=418. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained changepoint in demand over the last several concludes, I use the backend defaults so it applies (1+L) scaling to the full sample set and computes variability from all samples. This lets the OR engine compute the base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost using its capped order rule while accounting for the 4-period review+lead horizon.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent realized demand has been materially higher than the small-sample historical (2019 Jan) series; recent weekly demands (Periods ~18-37) average \u2248110 units. On-hand=339 + in-transit=418 provides ample coverage today, and concluded history consistently shows 4-period actual lead time. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4). To make the OR backend responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. I choose N=20 to capture the last ~20 demand observations (balances recency vs. sample size) so the base-stock policy increases target inventory to meet the materially higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability. This balances higher service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost given profit/hc ratio (q=0.8) which the OR engine will convert to z*.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline is healthy (total available + in-transit >> expected (1+L) demand). No recent sustained demand regime change detected since prior confirmed shifts. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend applies long-run sample statistics; this avoids overreacting to recent week-to-week noise and prevents excess ordering given already-large on-hand + pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Recent weekly demand has settled lower (last observed demand=47) but no new sustained regime change detected. To maintain stability and avoid under-ordering given ample pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies full historical mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead window.

Recent demand has dropped versus earlier spikes: last 5 concluded demands (P36-P40) = [53,79,56,47,24], mean \u224851.8. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set L=default (promised=4) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the optimizer targets current lower demand and reduces over-ordering given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=599, in-transit=195, profit=4, holding=1. Historical seed samples mean=12.4 (5 weekly samples) and previous conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time=4. No recent evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shifts since insights recorded earlier. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep alignment with observed arrivals. Choose default demand estimates so backend uses full sample mean scaled by (1+L) and default volatility; this yields conservative replenishment given high on-hand inventory and non-elevated recent demand, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=521, in-transit=228. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6) and no recent sustained regime shifts in demand; demand in recent months averages moderate weekly sales (~50\u2013160). To maintain high service (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) while avoiding excess holding, I use the promised/observed lead time (default) and estimate demand using the most recent 20 periods to capture the current regime. Thus: L=default (promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (high fill rate) against holding cost given large on-hand + pipeline and the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows stable observed lead time = 4 periods and demand has settled to moderate weekly levels (many recent weeks in the 20\u2013150 range). Current inventory: on-hand=654, in-transit=70 \u2014 ample cover vs. typical weekly demand; no new prolonged shipment losses observed. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (matches confirmed observed LT=4). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples; with high profit/holding ratio (q=0.8) the backend will target a high service-level base stock while the cap will limit runaway orders. This conservative/default setting avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise given large on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 40 (demands P40-P44 = 24,31,78,25,17), indicating a new low-demand regime. On-hand = 674 and in-transit = 118 provide ample coverage versus the recent low demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages; use promised/default L=4. For demand forecast I use a recent_N window to capture the new low-demand regime: choose N=5 (Periods 40-44) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use the same recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current low-volatility regime. These choices keep orders conservative (avoid excess holding cost) while the high on-hand plus in-transit sustains service during the transition.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weekly demand stabilized at low levels (most recent demands ~17\u201331) after earlier high-demand regime; lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes and there is sizeable on-hand (646) plus in-transit (118) so no urgent replenishment needed. Use promised/default lead time to remain consistent with observed confirmed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history\u2014this balances the high target service level (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) while avoiding overreacting to short recent fluctuations given large existing inventory and no new sustained changepoint.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=671, in-transit=110. Recent weekly demand has been low (single-digits to low-30s) since autumn but earlier in-year showed a large regime spike; lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods. No new sustained changepoint since last insights. To let the OR engine use full historical statistics and the promised/observed lead time, I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and uses the promised lead time. This balances service (uses full sample evidence including high-demand earlier periods) while avoiding ad-hoc short-window adjustments despite current low demand and monitors in-transit for lost shipments.
