Lead time & pipeline: 390 units ordered in Period1 remain in-transit and have not concluded by Period2; promised lead time=4 periods implies that P1 order would arrive during Period5 (visible in Period6), so those units are not available for Periods 3\u20134. Risk assessment: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/period, so excess pipeline/inventory quickly destroys profit. Any order placed now (Period3) with promised lead time=4 will not arrive until Period7 (and be visible later), so it cannot satisfy immediate demand and will incur holding cost when it eventually arrives if the earlier 390 also arrives. Recommendation: Do not place additional orders until we observe whether the P1 shipment concludes; avoid adding pipeline given equal profit and holding cost and current in-transit quantity that likely covers future demand if it arrives.",
