Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776001 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals/history of lead times. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks through 2019-02-04) will be used as the baseline. No evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time change (insufficient data), so use defaults: promised lead time and population-based demand moments. This lets the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full-sample statistics to balance service level (profit-driven q) vs holding cost while covering the (L+1) weeks of exposure given zero inventory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (ordered in P1) and P1 conclude shows arrived=0 so actual lead time not yet observed\u2014cannot infer a lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean=157.4. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals contradict it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps forecasting grounded in full history while awaiting arrival confirmations; flags: pipeline (225) is well below (1+L)*mean, so system may order up to cover the review+lead demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=459 (matches orders 225+234). No concluded arrivals yet; insufficient evidence to change promised lead time (promised L=4). Use default lead time so backend uses promised L. Demand history available (historic weekly samples plus recent periods) but no sustained changepoint detected; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps policy aligned with long-run demand while avoiding overreaction to two unconfirmed delayed arrivals. Pipeline (459) should cover multiple periods of demand; defaults balance service level and holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived=0; on-hand=0 and in-transit=713. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean ~157.4. Promised lead time is 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet so do not change lead-time estimate. Use default demand/variance calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps ordering driven by the long-run sample mean while avoiding manual reductions that might worsen stockouts if delayed shipments still arrive.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded (arrived=0) through Period 3; in-transit shows 713 units \u2014 indicates sustained delivery delays or possible lost shipments (evidence: P1 ordered=225, P2=234, P3=254; no arrivals by Period 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Demand recently spiked (period demands: P1=206, P2=239, P3=350, P4=260) vs historical Jan samples (145,144,105,181,212). On-hand=0, in-transit=1035 with orders from P1\u2013P4 not concluded, indicating shipments delayed/lost. I set L explicitly longer than promised to hedge against missing arrivals and force higher pipeline cover. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the clear upward regime in the last 4 periods. Sigma uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base_stock to protect service level given delayed/lost shipments while keeping variance estimate recent-focused to avoid overstock from older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Persistent delivery delays: orders placed P1-P4 (225,234,254,322 = 1035 units) have not arrived through Period 4; evidence of lost shipments or lead time > promised(4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand samples show weekly demands [145,144,105,181,212] (historic series). On-hand=0, in-transit=1176 (covers multiple weeks). One concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 4 (P1 ordered arrived in P5). Given that evidence, use promised/default lead time. No strong evidence of sustained demand regime shift; use default demand and volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps base-stock calibrated to historical mean while the large pipeline limits urgent ordering and helps avoid excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=1069. Concluded arrivals show orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6) \u2014 actual lead time matches 4. Recent demand (Periods 1-6 = 206,239,350,260,245,242) is substantially above the older sample mean (2019 Jan series ~157), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime; use recent data for demand mean and volatility. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime so the OR engine raises base stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while keeping volatility estimated from recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=1153 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will cover several periods but arrivals are observed with 1-period reporting delay. Demand has stepped up in the most recent 3 periods (Periods 5-7: 245,242,448), indicating a possible higher recent regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to lock in the confirmed L=4. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the newest demand regime (reduces risk of understocking given the recent spike). These choices ensure the backend computes a base-stock that responds to the confirmed lead time and elevated recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has jumped since Jan: last 4 realized weekly demands = [245,242,448,382] (avg\u2248329), much higher than earlier historical mean (~157). On-hand=0, in-transit=1337 (covers multiple weeks). Observed concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22484 historically. To capture the recent higher demand regime I set L to be estimated from observed lead times and used recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=4) so mu_hat reflects the recent surge while sigma_hat captures current variability. This balances service (higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by restricting the horizon to recent data rather than inflating forecasts with older low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=82, in-transit=1470; historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 periods (multiple orders confirmed). Pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover demand through the lead horizon. Use calculated L (average observed lead times = 4) so the backend forecasts (1+L) demand correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean/std scaled by review+lead) to let OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order; this balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=1373, recent demand elevated vs. earlier sample set (recent demands P6-P10 = 242,448,382,284,273). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). To reflect the confirmed LT and recent higher demand regime, set L via calculate (lets backend use observed average LT), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)*mean on the last 5 demand periods, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base stock to serve the higher recent demand while acknowledging confirmed LT and existing large pipeline, limiting overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Demand history (Periods 1-11) shows elevated mean vs earlier samples; to capture the current regime I use the recent 11 periods for demand mean and volatility. L set to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4 (backend will compute). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 11 demand samples\u2014this biases stocking to current higher demand while the pipeline (1503) reduces ordering need, balancing service level (high profit/higher z*) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=161, in-transit=1308. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, etc.). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-12) is materially higher than the 2019-Jan samples, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent elevated demand, set L using observed data and set mu/sigma using the last 8 concluded demand samples (Periods 5\u201312) so the OR engine targets service for the current higher-demand regime while accounting for observed variability and long lead time. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time and large pipeline) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than older low-Jan samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history (P5-P13) consistently shows orders arriving with a 4-period lag (e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. Current inventory: on-hand=380, in-transit=1268 (large pipeline) which with confirmed L=4 provides strong coverage vs recent demands. To reflect confirmed lead time use calculate for L (average of observed lead times). Use default demand estimators for mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set). This keeps forecasting anchored to historical samples while the OR engine applies the high service-level implied by profit/holding (profit=$19, holding=$1) to trade off stock vs holding cost given the large pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=101, in-transit=1258. Historical early samples (Jan 2019) are low, but demand since Period 5 is consistently higher (Periods 5-14 mean \u2248321.8). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=10 for demand estimates (captures Periods 5-14). This sets mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7recent mean to meet multi-period demand and sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect current volatility; L uses the promised/default lead time (consistent with observed concluded LT=4). These choices increase service (reduce stockouts) during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders to control holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=232, in-transit=1230 \u2014 ample pipeline but delays resolved and arrivals observed with L=4. I select L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). Demand estimate and volatility use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is appropriate because demand history shows no recent sustained mean shift requiring a shorter recent window, and the large pipeline reduces stockout risk. These parameters balance service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting OR set base-stock from full-sample mean while capping order size per its cap rule to limit excess holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded history (Periods 5-16) consistently shows orders arriving with a 4-period lag (multiple observed orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so actual lead time = promised 4. Current on-hand=151, in-transit=1143 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. typical weekly demand.

Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=253, in-transit=1111. Historical conclues show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed in P1..P13 consistently arrived after 4 periods). Demand sample mean from provided history = 157.4 units/week; with confirmed L=4 I use standard/default estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and full-sample std. This keeps forecasting anchored to all available demand history while reflecting the confirmed 4-period lead time; it balances service level (covers L+1 periods of expected demand) vs holding cost by letting the backend compute the exact z* and capped order. No evidence of a recent sustained demand regime change requiring aggressive reweighting.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1464 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover several periods but arrivals are only visible next period. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new regime in demand, use lead-time inferred from history and default demand estimates. Choices: L=calculate to capture the observed LT=4; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to use full-sample demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock consistent with historical demand and the confirmed lead time. This balances service level (high pipeline) against holding cost by not inflating forecast beyond observed demand.

Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=111, in-transit=1299. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived units with lead_time=4 periods (multiple confirmed observations), and no recent evidence of lost shipments. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given stable demand history and confirmed LT=4. The pipeline (in-transit + on-hand) is currently large, so relying on backend defaults avoids over-reacting to transient swings.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. To avoid over-ordering given large pipeline, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent demand (capture last 12 demand observations) so the OR backend computes a (1+L)-period forecast reflecting the elevated recent regime and corresponding volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=527, in-transit=1027. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals with W=4). Pipeline + on-hand currently ample vs recent weekly demand (~160-400). To keep alignment with observed lead time and avoid overfitting short-term noise, I use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility which use all samples; this lets the OR backend compute base_stock and cap using full-sample statistics while respecting the confirmed L=4. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is made because recent conclueds consistently match L=4.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=688, in-transit=837. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), and demand samples (provided history) show no recent regime break. Given ample pipeline + on-hand and confirmed LT=4, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L) scaling). This balances service (coverage for L+1 periods) while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given large current inventory.

On-hand = 965, in-transit = 606 \u2014 ample coverage vs recent weekly demand (historical samples mean ~177/week from seed series). To keep service while controlling holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), use lead time inferred from observations and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes a base-stock tuned to profit/holding ratio. This balances high unit profit (favoring availability) against low holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Demand context: recent weekly demand in history shows moderate steady demand (see full history); no new seasonal spikes. On-hand=1090, in-transit=478 \u2014 pipeline ample vs typical weekly demand. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, matching promised lead time. I therefore use default lead time to keep the model aligned with observed behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance the high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) via its internal service-level formula.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=1172, in-transit=340. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with a 4-period lag (multiple confirmed arrivals: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so actual lead time=4. Pipeline + on-hand well above recent weekly demand (~100\u2013450 range historically), and profit ($19) vs holding ($1) implies a high service target. Set L based on observed lead times; use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples, which balances high service level with modest holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: P1 arrival reported in Period 5; P2 arrival in Period 6; P3 arrival in Period 7; repeated confirmations thereafter).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=1194 and in-transit=338 (total pipeline 1532) comfortably covers several periods of demand; no new sustained demand regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed observations and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so the capped base-stock order balances service level (profit=19 vs holding=1) against holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand history (seed samples provided) shows no recent abrupt regime shift. I therefore use the promised lead time (default=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample statistics while the large on-hand position and existing pipeline reduce need for aggressive replenishment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent observed demand has stabilized around ~70-110 units/week while on-hand is high (1202) and in-transit is modest (304). Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Given ample on-hand inventory and confirmed LT=4, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies long-run sample mean/variance (conservative restocking to avoid excess holding). This avoids overreacting to short-term noise and accounts for promised LT in the pipeline calculation.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=1222, in-transit=264. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen from mid-year peaks (200s-400s) to ~70s in the last 4 weeks (Periods 30-33 demands = 74,72,70,74) \u2014 I detect a sustained low-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 4) because concludes confirm 4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new low-demand regime over the review+lead horizon, reducing order targets and holding cost while maintaining service. This reduces overstocking risk given large on-hand inventory and the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and recent weeks show steady lower weekly demand (~70\u2013120) compared with early-sample weeks. On-hand=1270 and in-transit=170 provide a large pipeline buffer. No evidence of new sustained demand or lead-time regime shifts in the last 3+ periods. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend retains L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, which balances service level with holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Current on-hand=1295 + in-transit=202 = 1497 units, while recent demand has fallen to ~68.4 units/week (periods 29-35). With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 \u2192 5\xd7recent mean \u2248 342 units. Pipeline + on-hand far exceed this, so no need to inflate targets. I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime starting around Period 29 (7-period regime: P29\u2013P35). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the new lower mean/volatility and avoids excess future ordering given current high inventory, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (repeated arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... through Period 36). Current inventory: on-hand=1309, in-transit=145 \u2014 ample coverage vs recent demand (no evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments). I therefore use the default lead time (promised), and default demand mean/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the full sample history, keeping service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff without overreacting to transient noise.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=1314 and in-transit=138 provide a large buffer vs recent weekly demands (~40-75 in recent months), so prioritize standard statistical policy to balance service vs holding. Use promised/default lead time (backend knows promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies its calibrated base-stock and cap. No evidence of new sustained regime change or lost shipments since lead time has been repeatedly confirmed; therefore no explicit adjustments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=1290, in-transit=173. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen to low weekly levels (Periods 34-38 demands = 46,34,43,49,24; mean \u224839). To keep service with low holding cost, set L to promised/default (4) and use recent demand (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime; use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters target (1+L)-period demand based on the latest regime and avoid overstocking given cheap but nonzero holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=1338, in-transit=82 \u2014 ample cover versus recent weekly demand (~30\u201375 units). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). No evidence of new lost shipments. Use lead time estimate derived from observed history to match confirmed pattern; use default/full-sample demand statistics for mu and sigma because demand appears stable vs. historical samples and on-hand is high, keeping orders conservative to avoid excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1308, in-transit=120. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time; recent history shows demand running ~30\u2013400 per week with current on-hand large relative to weekly demand, so risk of holding cost outweighs stockout risk. Use promised lead time (4) and default demand estimates from all samples to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps orders conservative given high on-hand and confirmed LT=4; it also avoids overreacting to isolated zero-arrival periods.

No new sustained lead-time or demand regime shift in recent periods (some single-period zero arrivals occurred but not persistent). Using promised/confirmed lead time and broad historical demand statistics keeps the OR engine stable: set L to default (promised=4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Recent small missed arrivals (Periods 38, 40, 43) are isolated and not a sustained lost-shipment pattern. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates based on all available historical samples (default) so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std transforms. This keeps ordering aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to a few zero-arrival periods given large on-hand buffer.

To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep L as promised (confirmed=4) and size mu_hat from the most recent demand regime. I choose recent_N=20 to capture the downward/seasonal demand in the last ~20 weeks. Use recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility for the backend's safety stock cap.

Current on-hand 1286 + in-transit 67 provides substantial cover vs. typical weekly demand. To keep policy aligned with observed operations and avoid overreacting to short-term noise, use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from full history. This balances service level (high on-hand) against holding cost and leverages confirmed L=4.
