Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 658030011 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Historical weekly samples (early Jan\u2013Feb) are the only demand signal. Use promised lead time to avoid unfounded lead-time adjustments. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics, providing balanced service level vs. holding cost given no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224885.2 units, std \u224826.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=129. Promised lead time=4; review+lead horizon =5 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248426 units, so current pipeline (129) is well below expected need. Only one conclude exists (Period 1: ordered=129 arrived=0) \u2014 insufficient evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use default promised L and population-based \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full sample statistics and increases ordering to cover the shortfall.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~85 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=275 (orders from P1+P2) but no concluded arrivals yet. Only two consecutive non-arrivals \u2192 insufficient evidence to change lead-time. Use promised lead time (default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while allowing the OR engine to cap orders given the current large in-transit volume, avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=418. Historical Jan samples mean=85.2 (n=5) but last 3 observed weeks (Periods1-3 demand=136,103,96) show a sustained higher regime. No concluded arrivals have been observed yet so do not override promised lead time. Set L to default (use promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean (1+L scaling will be applied by backend). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service given the clear 3-period demand increase while keeping lead time assumption conservative until arrivals conclude.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in Periods 1-3: avg demand increased from 85.2 (Periods Jan historical) to 111.7 (Periods1-3) (+31%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent weeks (Periods 1-3) show a sustained demand uptick vs. historical Jan samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=565 which already covers multiple weeks given promised lead time. No concluded arrivals yet so do not infer lost shipments. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed short-run higher regime from the most recent 3 demand observations; use the same recent_N (N=3) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples and accounting for pipeline stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed lead time observation: Period1 order arrived in Period5 (lead_time=4) matching the promised 4. Current inventory: on-hand=41, in-transit=436 (total pipeline 477) which already covers ~5 periods at recent demand rates. Demand history: historical samples mean=85.2 but recent concluded demands (Periods 3-5 = 96,84,88) average ~89.3 \u2014 lower than the earlier spike captured in carry-over. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed =4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent demand regime (Periods 3-5) and avoid overreacting to the earlier spike; this yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Sigma_hat use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to keep volatility estimate stable. These choices keep orders conservative because pipeline already large, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Observed demands recent: P1=136,P2=103,P3=96,P4=84,P5=88,P6=84. On-hand=103, in-transit=348 (matches orders: P3=143,P4=147,P6=58). Concluded arrivals show orders from P1\u2192P5 and P2\u2192P6, confirming actual lead time = 4 periods (two independent arrivals). No evidence of sustained new demand regime since the previously recorded shift (Periods1-3); recent weeks P4\u2013P6 are lower. Use calculated lead time from observed arrivals to reflect confirmed LT=4, and use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using full sample set) to avoid overfitting to short fluctuations while respecting the confirmed lead time. This balances service (using confirmed LT) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2954.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Historical concluded arrivals show orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7 => actual lead time = 4 confirmed. Recent demand since the regime shift (Periods 5-7) = [88,84,160], mean \u2248110.7 over last 3 periods; variance elevated due to a spike in P7. To reflect confirmed lead time and the recent higher-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples (N=3). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast to cover the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures the increased variability; this reduces stockout risk given confirmed L=4 and avoids overcommitting beyond the cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=136, in-transit=336 (matches orders P6-P8: 58+96+182=336) \u2014 no apparent lost shipments. Historical sample pool includes prior Jan samples and recent realized demands; recent window shows higher recent mean with a spike (P7=160). Lead time observed consistently = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 realized demands: Periods 4\u20138) to capture the currently elevated recent mean while limiting influence of older Jan samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to match the same recent volatility estimate. These choices steer the OR backend to a base-stock sized to cover the (1+L)-period demand under the recent regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) and inventory cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=54, in-transit=493 -> ample pipeline covering multiple periods of demand. Given stable confirmed lead time and no clear new demand regime beyond prior recorded shifts, use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats: this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run mean (reducing overreaction to short-term noise) while the cap limits order size to avoid oversized replenishments. Defaults balance service level (high pipeline) versus holding cost without inventing new regime changes.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. To adapt to recent demand regime while retaining lead-time certainty, use promised/default L=4, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 6 demand observations to capture recent demand mix (including a high spike at Period 7), and keep sigma_hat default to let the OR engine use full-sample volatility. This balances higher target stock for service (covering observed spike) versus modest holding cost (low holding=$1/unit).

Recent demands (Periods 5-11) show stable weekly demand ~80-160 with no new sustained regime shift since prior insight. Use promised/default lead time (matches confirmed actual LT=4). Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance profit vs holding cost given current strong pipeline and modest holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has been stable at ~80\u2013160/week with a prior regime shift already recorded. On-hand=197 + in-transit=280 = 477 units, which covers multiple (1+L)=5 review+lead periods of demand at recent rates, so no aggressive up- or down-adjustment needed. I set L to default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend produce a conservative base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost given the existing pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=281, in-transit=208 (total pipeline=489) \u2014 ample cover. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, etc.). Demand has recent lower mean vs earlier spike; to avoid excess holding cost given high inventory, set L to calculated average observed lead time (4). Forecast demand using recent_N (last 5 concluded demand periods) to capture the post-spike regime (reduces order quantity versus full-sample mean). Use recent_N volatility (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize reducing holding cost while maintaining service with confirmed L=4 evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=248, in-transit=170. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 5-14) has averaged higher than the 2019 historical samples but evidence of sustained regime change was already recorded earlier. To be conservative and let the OR engine use full-sample stats plus the promised lead time, I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders aligned with observed 4-period lead time and balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against inventory holding costs.

No clear recent sustained demand regime change needing model update. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding costs given current ample pipeline and modest holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Observed lead times in concluded history consistently 4 periods; promised lead time is 4. To keep parameters consistent with observed/promised lead time and the OR engine's defaults, use default lead time and default demand statistics (captures full sample history). This balances service (reasonable base stock over 5-week coverage) versus holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Demand has been stable since the earlier regime shift (no new sustained changepoint). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed LT and aggregate demand stats, I set L via 'calculate' (use observed average LT) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (using confirmed LT) against holding cost given high on-hand + pipeline.

On-hand=171 + in-transit=303 gives large pipeline; no obvious lost shipments in recent concludes (lead time historically confirmed at 4). To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised lead time and set demand forecast based on the most recent stable 3-period regime (captures the recent lower mean).

To be conservative and responsive to recent weekly demand patterns, I keep L as default (promised 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)\xd7forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations, capturing the current regime while smoothing short noise. I leave sigma_hat as default to let the backend compute variability from the full sample set. This balances service (use recent demand mean) and holding cost (no explicit over-ordering given healthy on-hand inventory).

To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and lower recent demand, use the promised/default lead time and population-level demand estimates so the OR backend down-scales orders via its capped policy. Methods: L=default to keep lead-time belief aligned with contract (and confirmed historically); mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean over all samples; sigma_hat=default to provide standard uncertainty estimate.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=346, in-transit=121. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (Periods 5\u201322 confirms). Demand has been stable since the earlier detected regime shift. I select L default (use promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms LT=4; mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std (scaled by 1+L) to compute base-stock and cap. This keeps policy aligned with observed steady demand while the large on-hand + in-transit buffer avoids stockouts if any single shipment is delayed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=274, in-transit=143. Historical concluces consistently show orders arriving after 4 periods (multiple confirmations), so use promised lead time. Recent realized demand (Periods 13-25) averages lower than early spike; no sustained new regime detected. To keep policy stable and let OR engine use full sample history, use default methods: L=promised (4), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (uses long-run demand estimate) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory and pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=202, in-transit=213 \u2192 pipeline=415 units (ample cover). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4; no new sustained demand or lead-time regime change in recent periods (demand recent weeks ~22\u201389, no 3+ period shift). Given high profit/low holding cost (q\u22480.95) we keep backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std and uses the promised L to produce a high service-level base stock while capping orders. This avoids overreacting to transient dips and leverages observed stable lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~60.5 over the last 6 periods (P22-P27: 39,54,28,72,72,98). On-hand 176 + in-transit 211 = 387 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at that recent demand level. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 4; no persistent lost shipments observed recently. To keep inventory aligned with the recent lower/variable demand regime, set L to default (use promised 4), use a recent_N demand forecast (last 6 samples) so mu_hat reflects the recent mean, and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to capture current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts) while reducing holding cost given current elevated on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). On-hand=131, in-transit=172 => pipeline+on-hand=303, which comfortably covers several periods of recent demand (weekly demands ~50\u2013100). No recent demand regime changepoint detected; use lead-time inferred from observations and default demand statistics to let OR backend compute base stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding ($1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=75, in-transit=276. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time=4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Pipeline + on-hand currently large, but demand recent weeks ~70\u2013100/week so maintain responsiveness. Set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirms 4). Use mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=10 to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent 10 demand observations (captures current regime without over-weighting older seasonal samples). Use sigma_hat 'default' to leverage full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by using recent demand for mean forecast while letting OR compute risk buffer from full-sample variability.

Pipeline is large relative to on-hand, so keep promised lead time and let OR engine compute demand forecast from full sample set. Choose L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been elevated (most recent 5 concluded demands: 98,94,78,130,124; mean=104.8) so set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current regime (backend will apply (1+L) factor). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by targeting replenishment to recent demand levels while relying on confirmed LT=4.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been high: last 5 demands = [94,78,130,124,123], avg \u2248109.8/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=448 units; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods, target demand \u22485\xd7110=550 \u2192 pipeline (448) is below target, so we should use recent demand to size replenishment. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals P1->P5 etc.), so use default promised L. Set mu_hat using recent 5-week mean to capture current high-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent 5-week std to reflect current volatility. This biases orders toward meeting elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders; holding cost is low relative to profit so favor service level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=469. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 observations). Recent demand has risen sharply: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29-33) = [78,130,124,123,230], indicating a higher recent mean and elevated variability vs. long-run history. I will keep L as default (promised=4) because concluded history confirms it. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking for the upcoming (L+1)-period coverage. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine inflates safety stock appropriately. This balances profit (high stockouts cost $19/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit) by biasing toward service in the face of recent demand surge and confirmed lead time.

Recent demand has increased and become more volatile in the last 7 concluded periods (Periods 28-34: demands = 94,78,130,124,123,230,117). To cover the review+lead horizon and reflect this recent regime, set L to calculated/promised (4) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds a base-stock around the recent higher mean and elevated variability, balancing the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff and aiming to reduce stockouts while capping orders via the OR cap.

Recent demand has been elevated (multiple weeks with 100+ units), but no new 3+ period sustained regime change since prior insight. Using default L (promised lead time = 4) to match confirmed arrivals; mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples which balances long-run mean demand with the large in-transit pipeline; sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples so safety stock reflects observed variability. This keeps ordering conservative given heavy pipeline and confirmed LT.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=32, in-transit=551 (pipeline=583) \u2014 ample cover vs. promised lead time. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. No evidence of recent demand regime change requiring adjustment. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level (high pipeline) with low holding cost given strong pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=64, in-transit=404 \u2014 ample pipeline but recent weeks show sustained higher demand (Periods 30-37: 130,124,123,230,117,119,118,115 with several stockouts), indicating a higher recent regime. Promised lead time is 4 and prior conclude messages confirm lead time historically. To capture the recent elevated demand while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap, set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent 7 demand observations. This raises target base-stock to improve fill rates during the confirmed higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding by restricting the window to recent data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Current on-hand 144 + in-transit 379 provides ample pipeline but recent months show a sustained higher-demand regime (autumn spikes, several weeks >100, recent peak 150). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use calculated lead time to lock that in. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while smoothing noise, set demand estimates using recent_N=20 (covers latest ~20 weeks including the autumn spike). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand period while controlling holding cost via the capped order rule.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). Current on-hand 221 + in-transit 333 = 554 units, which vs recent weekly demand (~100-150) provides several weeks' coverage. No sustained new demand regime detected. Use default (promised) lead time so OR backend uses full sample history; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std from all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows stable actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded P arrivals). On-hand=129, in-transit=366 (pipeline ample for next periods). Use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates based on all historical samples so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances service (high pipeline) and holding cost given profit $19 vs hold $1.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=34, in-transit=457. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 periods. Recent months (Periods ~30-38) show elevated and more volatile weekly demand (many weeks 100-230) versus earlier history. To reflect the confirmed LT and recent higher-demand regime, set L via recent observed lead times and set demand forecasts using a recent-window to capture the Sept\u2013Oct demand spike and current Nov levels. Using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances responsiveness to the new regime while smoothing short noise; this provides the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand estimate and volatility aligned to current patterns, while L calculate ensures the backend uses observed lead time=4.

LLM Rationale:

Pipeline (130+438=568) is large relative to typical 5-period demand, so avoid increasing targets and keep default statistical estimates. Use promised lead time (default) and let OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample set to balance service level vs holding cost.

Pipeline (214 on-hand + 328 in-transit = 542) covers multiple weeks of recent demand but we maintain baseline forecast. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level implied by profit/holding cost while avoiding overfitting to short-term fluctuations.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=170, in-transit=335. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (many P->P+4 arrivals), so set L by calculating observed lead time average. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 92,95,109,44,77) is lower than earlier spikes; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock to current demand while honoring observed lead time and limiting excess inventory holding.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time (multiple P->P+4 confirmations) and no new sustained demand regime shift since prior insight.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Recent weekly demand has averaged ~79 units (Periods 42-46 = 109,44,77,92,75) after an earlier sustained uplift; lead time has been confirmed as 4 historically. On-hand (280) + in-transit (212) = 492 excesses current pipeline vs short-term demand; avoid overstock but maintain service given high profit/low holding (profit $19, holding $1 => target quantile ~0.95). I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime (mean of last 5 \u224879.4, so (1+L)*mean \u2248397). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability and compute sigma over same window. These parameters let the OR backend size a high service-level base stock while anchoring forecasts to the most recent demand regime and avoiding using stale low-demand historical samples.
