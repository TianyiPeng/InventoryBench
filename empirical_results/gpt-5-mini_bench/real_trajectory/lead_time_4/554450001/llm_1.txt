Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=70, in-transit=615 => total available over future arrivals = 685 units (but arrivals will only be visible after those arrival periods). Decision logic: using L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 upcoming periods of demand. Use conservative forecast ~150 units/period to allow modest holiday uplift => target cover = 5 * 150 = 750 units. Current on-hand+in-transit = 685 so shortfall \u2248 65 units. Holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), so top up to cover shortfall rather than risking stockout. Place order for 65 units.",

  "rationale": "Date is 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas) \u2014 apparel (jeans) often sees elevated pre-Christmas demand. Historical recent regime (Periods 27-33) showed elevated avg ~160/week; Nov 25 showed an isolated Black Friday spike (499) but not a sustained new regime. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. Decision must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I use a conservative elevated-week forecast of 160 units/week to capture holiday lift: 160*5 = 800 units required over next 5 periods. Current coverage = on-hand (104) + in-transit (520) = 624. Order needed = 800 - 624 = 176 units. This minimizes stock while covering expected holiday demand and limiting holding cost exposure.",

Planning horizon: must cover L+1 = 5 future periods. Required cover \u22485\xd7110 = 550 units. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 156, in-transit = 546, total = 702 units, which exceeds the 5-period cover and provides safety stock. Holding cost = $1/unit/period argues against additional ordering.
