Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand shows an upward trend (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04 = 240,251,252,269,354). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Use promised lead time (default L=4). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=5 to capture the rising regime across all 5 recent samples. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture recent spike) while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap parameter.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg increased from ~246 (earlier samples) to ~292 (last 3 samples) (+19%), sustained over 3+ periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/18. Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples mean \u2248291.7 vs earlier \u2248245). On-hand=0, in-transit=350 (Period 1 order not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals to update actual lead time\u2014use default promised L to avoid premature inference. To capture the confirmed higher demand regime, set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (recent_N, N=3). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to service the higher mean while keeping sigma aligned with recent variability; using default L ensures pipeline coverage aligns with promised lead time given missing conclude data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand regime shift detected around 2019-01-21 with higher mean in latest samples; no concluded arrivals yet so promised lead time retained. On-hand=0 + in-transit=816 provides partial coverage but uncertainty remains until arrivals conclude. I use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the higher recent mean (reflecting the documented regime shift) and recent_N=3 for volatility to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service given lost/ delayed arrivals risk while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1257. No concluded arrivals yet for prior orders; promised lead time remains best prior. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher recent mean), so I base demand forecast on the last 3 samples to capture the new regime while keeping L=promised to avoid overreacting to in-transit stock uncertainty. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat targets the most recent higher-demand regime and keeps safety sizing responsive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=1718; four recent orders (Periods 1\u20134) have not yet concluded but promised lead time=4 could still hold. Recent demand in Periods 1\u20134 = {414,399,321,247} shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier history (4 periods). To capture the current elevated mean and volatility while remaining conservative on lead time (no confirmed lead-time change), I use default L (promised) and recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and cap using the most recent 4-period demand regime. This increases service for observed higher demand while limiting excess inventory by relying on current pipeline (in-transit=1718).

Daily Reward (R_t): $875.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Current on-hand=105, in-transit=1522. Period 5 conclude shows arrived=350 (ordered P1) with observed lead_time=4 -> confirms promised L=4. Demand history shows a recent regime (sustained ~3+ periods) so I use recent data to capture that shift. Set L by calculating observed lead times (use average of observed =4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent regime over the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this reduces overreaction to older high-demand outliers while keeping service against current demand. This balances profit (higher fill) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-6) ~247,245,265 \u2014 a stable lower regime vs earlier spikes. On-hand 306 + in-transit 1056 = 1362 units provides coverage for multiple (1+L) periods. Two concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1->arrived P5 and P2->arrived P6 (both lead_time=4). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual =4. To reflect the recent lower-but-stable demand regime, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across review+lead using the last 3 periods (Periods 4-6). This balances service (captures current demand level) while avoiding excess holding given material already in pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period5; Period2 order arrived Period6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand elevated vs earlier baseline; last 5 observed demands = [321,247,245,265,331], recent mean \u2248281.8. On-hand=416 + in-transit=615 = 1,031 units vs (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248 5\xd7281.8=1,409 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand likely insufficient to cover a sustained elevated regime. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods; use observed-average for L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand samples. These settings prompt the OR backend to raise the base-stock toward current demand while the capped cap prevents extreme orders given pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent observed demand (concluded Periods 5-8) = [245,265,331,283], showing a sustained higher regime vs earlier samples. On-hand 594 + in-transit 504 = 1098 units in pipeline; several recent arrivals confirmed lead time=4. I keep L = promised (default) consistent with confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the upshift evident in the last 4 concluded demands and avoid dilution by older lower samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) so service-level sizing reflects current volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the higher recent mean while controlling holding costs given large on-hand inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 245,265,331,283,201) shows a new higher regime vs earliest samples; on-hand=547 and in-transit=692 provide substantial coverage but future periods follow promised 4-period lead. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4-period arrivals and promised=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands (5*265=1325) so orders target the recent mean across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability rather than older low-variance samples. These choices aim to maintain service during the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess inventory given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (last 3 historical weekly samples average ~292, ~19% above prior). On-hand=417, in-transit=869; no new lost-shipment signal. I keep L as promised (default) = 4 to align with supplier promise and prior confirmations. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher recent mean (weights the last 3 weeks where demand rose). Sigma is recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility post-changepoint. These settings bias base-stock higher to meet the elevated demand while sigma recent_N avoids over-smoothing from older low-demand samples, balancing service level vs holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent demand (Periods 5-11) shows mean \u2248232.6 units/week with moderate volatility and a previously recorded sustained regime shift (start 2019-01-21). On-hand=244, in-transit=869 -> pipeline inventory large relative to recent weekly demand (covers multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use calculated lead time to reflect confirmed reality. To keep orders aligned to the current lower-but-stable demand regime, set mu_hat using recent data (last 7 concluded demand samples, Periods 5-11) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over the current regime. Match sigma_hat to the same recent window (N=7) to reflect current variability and avoid excess safety stock. These choices reduce over-ordering given high pipeline while preserving service by sizing base stock to recent demand multiplied by review+lead period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples ~292 vs earlier ~246). On-hand=367, in-transit=699 (ample pipeline). Lead time evidence (concluded arrivals) consistently 4 periods. I set L to calculate to lock in the observed lead-time average (confirmed 4). Demand forecast uses recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). Volatility uses recent_N N=3 to reflect the recent regime's variability. These settings keep base-stock aligned to the confirmed lead time and the elevated recent mean while avoiding overweighting older, lower-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=486, in-transit=357. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has stabilized above earlier baseline; to capture current regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect latest 6 observations and (1+L) aggregation. L set to calculate to use observed lead times. This balances service (higher recent mean) vs holding cost by basing safety on recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand regime elevated since 2019-01-21 (carry-over). On-hand=412 + in-transit=466 gives healthy pipeline vs (1+L) demand but we preserve elevated recent mean. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (last 3 samples), keeping safety against overstock while matching recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=145, in-transit=725. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4; recent demand (~last 11 periods) centers around mid-200s with a prior regime shift upward documented earlier. I use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime (reactive to recent mean) while keeping sigma_hat as default to let backend use overall sample volatility. This biases orders toward meeting near-term demand increases while avoiding overreaction to single spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=102, in-transit=888 (ample pipeline). Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent mean \u2248292 over last 3 samples). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly. To reflect the higher recent demand while respecting confirmed L=4 and to keep safety stock responsive to recent variability, I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat based on recent_N=3 (captures the +19% uplift seen since 2019-01-21), and sigma_hat based on recent_N=3 to size variability from the same recent regime. This increases target base-stock to cover the (1+L) periods under the new regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples; given large in-transit inventory, this also prevents unnecessary additional ordering now.

Profit=$4, holding=$1 so critical ratio = 0.8; use the backend's default statistics to let it compute base-stock given promised L=4 and full-sample mean/variance. Defaults keep the OR engine's estimates stable while the large in-transit position covers upcoming demand and avoids overreacting to recent period-to-period noise.

Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21; to reflect recent elevated demand and avoid stockouts while limiting holding costs, I keep L as promised (default) and use recent demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. I select recent_N (N=5) to use the latest 5 demand observations (captures current mean/volatility) so the backend computes base_stock tuned to recent demand and the capped order cap will limit excess ordering given large pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no recent evidence of further shift. Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 already recorded in carry-over; recent weeks show lower realized sales (some stockouts) but not a sustained new regime. Use promised lead time (default) and baseline demand estimates (default) so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service vs. holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

On-hand=750 and in-transit=519 give strong pipeline; profit/holding implies high service target (q=0.8). I keep L as promised (4) to match observed confirmations, use a recent-N demand estimate to focus on the post-changepoint regime (capture elevated mean), and keep sigma as default to let backend scale variability with full history. This balances higher service (avoid stockouts given strong pipeline) while avoiding excessive new ordering since on-hand + in-transit is ample.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=859, in-transit=252. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4. Recent weeks (Periods 20-24) show lower demand (70,99,155,160,59) vs earlier regime; to reflect current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to size (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty. L kept as default (promised=4, confirmed by history) so backend preserves proven lead time. This balances service (use recent lower mean to avoid excess holding) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=805, in-transit=216 (pipeline=1021) >> typical weekly demand (~70\u2013300 historically). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; I'll use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; to capture the recent higher mean I use recent_N for mu_hat using the most recent 20 samples to reflect the post-shift regime while smoothing short noise. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine retains broad uncertainty. This configuration prioritizes service (high q from profit vs holding) while acknowledging sustained demand increase and current large pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=674, in-transit=274; pipeline+on-hand covers many periods so risk of overstock. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (multiple orders confirmed). Demand regime shift was detected starting 2019-01-21 and has persisted (higher mean in later samples). Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean on the sustained post-changepoint regime while smoothing older data. Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than entire-history STD. These choices steer the OR backend to size base-stock for the current higher-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples; given high on-hand/pipeline I expect the capped ordering rule to limit new receipts and reduce holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Current on-hand=716, in-transit=122. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods 23-27) is moderate but not a sustained new regime beyond previously recorded shift (Period 1 insight). No evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time to keep policy aligned with supplier terms and historical confirmation. Use default demand and volatility estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend leverages the full historical sample set and smooths short-term noise while the capped ordering cap prevents overly large single orders given existing pipeline.

Inventory is high (on-hand 540 + in-transit 488) so avoid inflating forecast; use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded P arrivals = 4). On-hand=373 and in-transit=704 (pipeline=1077) >> typical weekly demand, so inventory is abundant; no evidence of lost shipments. Demand regime increased earlier in the series and has been sustained; to focus the forecast on the current regime I use a recent-window demand estimate. Choices: L set to calculate to let backend confirm observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (matches confirmed L=4). mu_hat: recent_N with N=20 to capture the current sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing transient noise ((1+L)*mean of last 20 samples). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility over the same window. These parameters keep target base-stock aligned to the confirmed 4-period lead time and the recent higher-demand regime, avoiding understocking while limiting extra holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods and demand has a sustained upward regime since 2019-01-21. To reflect the confirmed LT and recent higher demand, keep L as promised (default) and use recent demand statistics for the review+lead period: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 20 demand samples to capture the post-changepoint regime while smoothing noise. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the newer demand and uses recent_N for sigma to size safety stock appropriately, balancing service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline on board.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=66, in-transit=626; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4. Demand exhibited a sustained lift around 2019-01-21 and recent weeks remain elevated. To reflect recent demand levels while relying on confirmed lead time, set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures latest demand pattern and reduces influence of older lower-demand periods). This balances service (by sizing base-stock to recent higher demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline inventory. No evidence of new lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $932.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1009. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals lagging orders by 4 periods (stable). Profit/holding imply a high service quantile (q=0.8). No recent demand regime change beyond already recorded history. I select the promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses L=4; use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leverages the full historical sample set and the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; it keeps orders sized by the backend's base-stock + cap logic given the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=117, in-transit=890, profit=4, holding=1. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Demand regime shift in Jan 2019 (noted in carry-over) persists but no new sustained change in recent periods. Given confirmed lead time and no new changepoint, use defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps the OR engine aligned with long-run demand estimates while respecting the proven 4-period lead time and avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~236 over the last 7 observed weeks (Periods 32-38: 195,317,259,218,236,236,197). On-hand=277, in-transit=769 -> pipeline=1,046 units, so current coverage roughly equals a 5-week forecast. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To align ordering with the recent demand regime and avoid adding excess stock, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 7 weeks) scaled by (1+L)=5. I keep L as default (promised 4) since observed lead time matches promise. sigma_hat uses the same recent 7-sample window to capture recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward a base-stock sized for current demand regime while reflecting observed lead time and recent variability, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts since prior insights. Profit/holding ratio implies high target service level; therefore use promised lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base stock from full historical samples, letting it balance fill rate vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current on-hand=134, in-transit=884. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline is large relative to on-hand. Demand has been stable recently around ~220 units/week (last 5 demands: 236,236,197,222,220; mean \u2248222). I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime (last 5 weeks) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, keeping service high while avoiding excess holding given already-large pipeline.

Recent carry-over notes record a demand regime shift around 2019-01-21 (+19%) and lead time confirmed at 4. No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoints in the last several periods. Given ample pipeline and confirmed 4-period lead time, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its long-run stats while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=839 (ample pipeline but arrivals unseen until next conclude). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4; keep promised L to match observed behavior and OR assumptions. Recent demand shows elevated levels (last 5 demands: 197,222,220,209,467) \u2014 large spike in most recent period (467) likely holiday/Promotional; to be responsive I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so base_stock reflects the short-term uptick while keeping sigma from the same window. This balances service (capture recent surge) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory and confirmed steady lead time.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Given confirmed LT=4 and large pipeline covering multiple periods, use default lead time and population-wide demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to a single spike while keeping service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1). No new sustained changepoint detected.

Inventory pipeline (153+959) is ample vs typical weekly demand but we keep default statistical estimates to let OR backend compute base stock given promised L=4. Use default methods (promised L and full-sample demand mean/std) so backend applies (1+L) scaling and its cap logic; this balances service level (profit > holding cost) while avoiding manual over-adjustment for one-off spikes.
