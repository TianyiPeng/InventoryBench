Jeggings (ladies denim) have steady regular demand; no major holiday spike in mid-February for this category. b) Demand analysis: historic weekly demand series: 2019-01-07:28, 01-14:20, 01-21:21, 01-28:11, 02-04:11. Recent mean has declined; last 3 weeks average ~14.3, last 2 weeks average =11. I adopt a conservative near-term forecast of 12 units/week to reflect the recent downshift while allowing modest upside. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time =4 periods. No in-transit or arrivals observed; no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. Assume supplier will require the promised 4-period pipeline coverage. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so to cover current period demand (occurs after decision) plus 4 future periods we must order for (L+1)=5 periods. e) Order logic: Order quantity = forecast per period (12) \xd7 (L+1)=12\xd75=60 units. This balances service (avoid stockouts given empty pipeline) versus holding cost (holding=$1/ unit/period) and moderate recent demand decline.",

Recent history shows volatility with a single extreme spike in P17 (demand=98) that exhausted stock\u2014this is an outlier (single period) and not yet a sustained regime change (needs 3+ periods). Lead time & pipeline: Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. Reconcile in-transit: orders of 2 (P14), 2 (P16), 20 (P17) sum to 24 in-transit but arrivals are staggered: P14->arrive P18 (2 units will arrive during this period), P16->P20 (2), P17->P21 (20). Current physical availability for Period 18 demand will be 2 units (arriving) + on-hand 0 = 2. Decision logic: Because the P17 spike is an isolated outlier and additional in-transit supply (24 units) will replenish in upcoming weeks (2, then 2, then 20), placing more order now (which would arrive in P22) risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) versus profit ($4/unit).

Lead time: confirmed = 4 periods (historical concludes). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=650 units (includes orders placed in prior periods, e.g., P43/P45). Demand history: recent sales P43\u2013P45 = 122,130,126 (three consecutive high weeks); P42 was an outlier spike (338) likely Black Friday. Forecast & decision: with LT=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of upcoming demand after ordering. A conservative 5-week demand estimate using recent non-spike weeks \u2248125/week \u2192 ~625 units. In-transit=650 already exceeds that coverage, so no new order is needed and avoids unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while still meeting expected demand and preserving profit margin ($4/unit sold). Order 0 now so arrivals remain capped by existing pipeline.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is week of 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, still holiday season) \u2014 recent weeks show sustained elevated demand. Demand regime: Recent confirmed high-demand regime starting P43 (Periods 43\u201345 avg \u2248126/week; Period 46 demand=122) \u2014 continue to expect ~120\u2013130 units/week. Lead time & pipeline: Lead time confirmed = 4 periods; in-transit=630 consists of outstanding orders (200 from P43 arriving this period, 430 from P45 arriving P49). Decision window: With L=4, orders placed now would arrive in P51; we must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand (P47\u2013P51). Forecast 5-week demand \u2248 5*125 = 625 units. Inventory position: on-hand 0 + in-transit 630 \u2248 630 \u2265 forecast 625, so pipeline is sufficient without new orders. Ordering now would only increase holding cost with little upside. Action: place no order this period.",
