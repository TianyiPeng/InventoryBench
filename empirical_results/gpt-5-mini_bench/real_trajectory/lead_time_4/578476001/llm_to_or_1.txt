Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show recent mean ~62.6 units/week; promised lead time=4 periods. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level using observed demand without overfitting to minimal history. This also avoids prematurely adjusting for lost/delayed shipments (no evidence yet).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand history (samples: 59,59,54,63,78; mean=62.6) shows no sustained regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=78 (order placed Period 1) \u2014 arrival not yet expected in concluded history (promised lead time=4). The Period 1 order arriving=0 is within expected lead-time window, so no evidence of lost shipment or changed lead time. Use default promised lead time to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance: L=default keeps the promised 4-period lead time assumption; mu_hat=default uses (1+L)*mean of all samples to reflect demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to capture aggregate variability. This balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding premature adjustments based on a single overdue-conclude.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=158. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) available; two recent orders (P1:78, P2:80) have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 suggests delays but only 2 periods of missing arrivals (not yet a sustained lead-time change). Promised lead time remains 4; to avoid overreacting to possible transient delays I keep L at default. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. This preserves stability while we observe whether shipments are lost or lead time has truly changed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) shows 72,80,73 \u2014 a sustained higher regime versus earlier historical samples (mean\u224862.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=242 (covers upcoming demand but arrivals not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so do not revise L. To respond to the detected upward demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 3 concluded demand samples (captures the new mean over the review+lead period). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect the increased variability in recent weeks. These choices raise the base-stock forecast to better meet higher demand while keeping lead time assumption conservative given lack of arrival confirmation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: historical mean=62.6 (2019-01 samples) -> recent avg=75.0 (Periods 1-3 conclude: 72,80,73), +19.8% (sustained over 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=325. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1\u2013P4 still unconfirmed) \u2014 not enough evidence to change promised lead time. Historical sample shows a sustained demand uptick (recent avg \u224875 over last 3 demand observations), so I set demand estimates to recent_N=3 to capture the new regime. Using recent demand mean raises base-stock to improve service given current zero on-hand and large in-transit; recent_N sigma captures updated variability to avoid excessive safety stock. L left as promised to avoid overcorrecting for unconfirmed shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded demands show moderate variability; on-hand=23, in-transit=292 (total pipeline+OH=315) which already roughly covers a 5-period demand forecast at historical mean. We observed one concluded arrival: order placed Period 1 arrived Period 5 \u2192 observed lead time = 4 (matches promised). No new sustained demand/lead-time signal beyond the previously recorded regime shift. Choose lead time based on observed data (calculate) to confirm promised L=4; use default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full historical samples, keeping service level high given profit/holding ratio.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1->P5 and P2->P6). On-hand 66 + in-transit 240 = 306 units, giving substantial cover. To reflect confirmed lead time, set L by calculating observed lead times. Demand has recent variability (early-period spike then lower demands in P5-6); to balance service vs holding cost I use a recent mean to capture short-term shifts (N=5) while keeping sigma conservative (default). These params ensure the backend computes base-stock using recent demand signal and accurate observed lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed actual lead times from concluded messages: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7 => lead_time=4 confirmed. Recent demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) shows a sustained higher regime: demands = 72, 80, 73 (avg=75) vs historical mean=62.6. On-hand=99 + in-transit=172 => pipeline=271, but (1+L)=5 period demand at recent rate = 5*75 = 375, so pipeline is insufficient and we should size orders to cover the higher regime. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the 3-period demand regime (N=3); set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend toward a higher base stock to improve service while acknowledging holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent conclude history shows arrivals from Periods 1-4 with observed lead_time=4 each \u2014 confirm LT=4. On-hand=140, in-transit=89; pipeline plus on-hand covers near-term demand but demand has shown variability (early high weeks then softer weeks). I set L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4. For mu_hat/sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to emphasize the most recent demand regime (captures last 5 observed weekly demands) so the OR backend targets stocking for current demand levels while keeping safety stock for variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand shows a sustained uplift (recent 3 concluded demands: 72, 80, 73; recent mean=75). All observed concludes for prior orders indicate actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P5 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand + in-transit = 154 + 67 = 221 units, which is well below (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 5*75 = 375, so we should target the higher recent demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed = 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent regime shift; this biases base-stock toward the higher recent mean while sigma reflects recent volatility, improving service while containing holding cost given the confirmed lead time and current pipeline shortfall.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=161, in-transit=44. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders from P1-P6 arrived after 4). Recent demand (Periods 5-10) shows a sustained lower regime. I set L using calculate to reflect the observed average lead time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to make the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent six demand observations (Periods 5-10 mean=39.5), reducing target base-stock to avoid excess holding while preserving service given stable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean=62.6 (2019-01 samples) -> recent avg=39.5 (Periods 5-10), -36.9% (sustained over 6 periods).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded demand (Periods 5-11) = [55,37,51,42,31,21,23] shows a sustained lower regime vs. historical Jan samples (recent avg \u2248 38.6 over 7 periods). On-hand=154, in-transit=45. Actual lead times observed in concludes consistently = 4 periods, so use promised/default L. To reflect the sustained lower demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7-period lowered regime). This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and volatility so the OR backend will lower order quantities and avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 5 (Periods 5-12 avg demand \u2248 39.5 vs historical 62.6). Lead times previously observed are stable at 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4); no sustained evidence of change or lost shipments. On-hand=126 and in-transit=57 (ample pipeline). To avoid overstock while matching the recently-lowered demand, keep L at default (promised 4) but use recent demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime. I select recent_N with N=8 (Periods 5\u201312) to capture the sustained drop; same N for sigma_hat to reflect current variability. This reduces target base-stock and caps orders to limit holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has settled below historical levels: last 9 observed demands (Periods 5-13) = [55,37,51,42,31,21,23,28,19], recent avg \u224834.11 units/week vs historical mean 62.6. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded arrivals (orders placed P1-P7 arrived with lead_time=4). On-hand=130 + in-transit=55 = 185 units, which covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean \u2248170.6 units, so current pipeline is sufficient. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set L="calculate" to lock in the observed lead time=4, and use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the full low-demand regime (9 periods). These parameters reduce target base stock relative to historical samples and avoid over-ordering while preserving service given the confirmed lead time and current pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): recent demand has settled well below historical levels. Last three concluded demands = [28,19,17] \u2192 recent avg \u2248 21.33. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 when shipments arrived. Inventory: on-hand=118, in-transit=61 (total pipeline=179) \u2014 this comfortably covers a (1+L)-period forecast at the low recent demand. Choices: set L=calculate to use observed lead-time average (matches exhibited 4); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecasts/volatility to the most recent low-demand regime (captures the drop from earlier periods and avoids overstock). These parameters steer the OR backend to target a lower base-stock aligned with the sustained lower demand while preserving service by reflecting actual lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime since Period 11 (demands P11-P15 = 23,28,19,17,14). On-hand=121 + in-transit=44 provides ample cover vs. expected demand; no obvious lost-shipment pattern beyond earlier partial fills. Observed lead times in concluded arrivals are consistently 4 periods. To capture the recent lower-demand regime, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the 5 most recent demand samples, biasing the base-stock toward the current lower demand while keeping volatility informed. This balances service (avoid overstock given current low demand) versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: P5 arrived from P1, P6 from P2, P7 from P3, P8 from P4, P13 from P9, P14 from P10, P15 from P11).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=127, in-transit=32 gives ample coverage vs. low recent demand but I use recent_N to reflect the lower demand regime and reduced variability. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages, so I use calculated lead time. These choices reduce overstock risk while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=140, in-transit=11. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages show orders placed arriving after 4 periods). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 11 (recent demands: P12-P17 = 28,19,17,14,6,8); I will use a recent-window forecast to capture the reduced mean and volatility. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 6 concluded demand samples, which helps the OR backend reduce excess stocking while maintaining service through the 4-period lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 4 concluded demands: 14,6,8,7), while on-hand inventory is high (144) and in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals visible). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the confirmed LT and the recent low-demand regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime, avoiding excess service-level stock given current low demand and high on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=137, in-transit=0; recent demand has fallen substantially vs. historical Jan samples. Historic mean (Jan)=62.6/week but a sustained low-demand regime appears from Period 12\u201319 (demands: 28,19,17,14,6,8,7,7; avg\u224813.25). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. To avoid overstock while covering review+lead demand, I use promised lead time and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (last 8 concluded periods). Methods: L=default (use promised L=4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture the new low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to reflect reduced volatility. This reduces ordering relative to historical averages and limits holding cost given high on-hand and zero in-transit.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 earlier (carry-over) and recent orders show no in-transit stock; given high on-hand and zero pipeline, we should not chase supply. Demand has been in a lower regime for at least 6 periods (Periods 15-20 demands = 14,6,8,7,7,2; recent avg \u22487.33), so set demand estimates from the recent regime (N=6) to avoid overstock. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses the confirmed 4-period promise. sigma estimated from the same recent window to reflect lower variance. These choices keep base_stock aligned to current low demand while avoiding unnecessary replenishment given ample on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand is low versus historical: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21) = [8,7,7,2,6], avg=6.0/week (\u2248-36% vs long-run 62.6). On-hand=129, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pending arrivals and several recent orders arrived=0, indicating supplier has not shipped recently. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time history (concluded data consistently shows 4 periods). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the currently low regime: (1+L)*mean of last 5 = 5*6=30 units across review+lead. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture current low-variance regime. These settings reduce replenishment to match depressed demand and avoid excess holding cost while still covering the (L+1)-period demand window given on-hand inventory and potential supplier unreliability.

On-hand = 123, in-transit = 0; no incoming pipeline, so we do not need to chase lost arrivals. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods, so use promised/default L. To avoid overstocking given the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Period 11 onward). This reduces target base-stock to match the new lower demand while sigma estimated from same recent window captures current variability. These parameters prioritize profit by matching replenishment to the lower demand and reducing holding cost exposure.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 11 (sustained low weekly sales: P11-P24). On-hand=115, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected/overdue. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history; keep promised lead time. To align forecasting with the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data from the current low-demand regime. This lowers target base-stock and avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 11 (last 7 demands: 7,2,6,2,4,8,24; recent avg \u22487.6/week) and on-hand is high (91) with no in-transit. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime while accounting for the 4-period review+lead window, I use the promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent regime (last 7 periods). This keeps orders conservative (avoids excess holding cost) while covering expected (L+1)-period demand variability via recent demand mean and volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after a large selldown in Period 26 (demand 94, sold 91). Historical samples early-2019 show mean ~62.6 and prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 4. Recent single large spike (Period 26) is not yet a sustained regime change. Several earlier late/zero arrivals occurred but lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. To be conservative and align with confirmed lead time and long-run demand stats, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (covers expected (L+1) periods) versus holding cost given no strong evidence of a persistent new demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand spike: Periods 25-27 demand = 24,94,104 (avg=74.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=81 (ordered P27) \u2014 arrival will follow promised L=4 and is not visible this period. Historical baseline mean=62.6. Given a recent 3-period uptick (sustained for 3 periods) I use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility to capture the new higher demand regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms lead time=4 and backend expects promised L. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the recent surge while sigma_recent increases safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: recent avg (P25-27)=74.0 vs historical mean=62.6 (+18.2%), sustained over 3 periods (P25-P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand shows elevated regime: Periods 25-27 avg ~74 (P25=24,P26=94,P27=104) and Period 28 demand=89\u2014sustained high demand over last 3\u20134 weeks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). On-hand=0, in-transit=227 which already covers multiple future weeks but OR backend needs demand forecast across review+lead. I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat based on the most recent 3 demand observations to capture the recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat also from the most recent 3 to reflect current volatility. This raises the base-stock target to meet higher near-term demand while avoiding excessive extra safety from older low-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has jumped: Periods 27-29 demands = 104, 89, 80 (avg 91). On-hand=0, in-transit=336. Historical lead times observed consistently = 4 periods. To cover the (L+1) review+lead horizon and reflect the recent high-demand regime, set L=default (promised 4), use mu_hat recent_N over last 3 periods to capture the new high mean (1+L times avg of 91 => backend will compute), and set sigma_hat recent_N over last 3 periods to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given large recent demand while relying on confirmed lead-time and current pipeline (336 < implied (1+L)*recent_mean).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=447 (multiple recent orders placed P27-P30 not yet concluded). Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 94,104,89,80,128) shows a sustained high-demand regime vs historical mean (avg=99.0 vs 62.6, +57.9% over 5 periods). No concluded arrivals contradict promised lead time, so keep L at default (promised). To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the detected regime length) so the OR backend increases target base-stock and safety stock appropriately while respecting pipeline. This balances higher service level for the sustained spike while avoiding overreaction beyond the 5-period regime evidence.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has jumped and stayed high since Period 26 (demands: 94,104,89,80,128,129). On-hand=0, in-transit=449 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have 1-period observation lag. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=6 for demand mean/volatility (Periods 26-31) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated regime; L set to calculate to let backend confirm observed average lead time (effectively 4). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 26\u201331 (carry-over noted avg ~99 over P26-30). On-hand=32, in-transit=413 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent 5 demand samples (reflecting P29\u2013P33/P28\u2013P32 window depending on backend indexing). Using default L (promised lead time=4) keeps OR engine aligned with contractual lead time while recent_N demand estimates raise the base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime without over-inflating safety stock beyond recent volatility. This balances profit-driven service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using a focused recent sample for sigma_hat.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=442 (pipeline large from recent orders). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 26 (multiple large demands and stockouts in P26-P33). Lead time has consistent concluded evidence = 4; use calculated L to reflect observed history. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new high-demand regime (covers Periods 26-33). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect elevated volatility in this regime. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward higher coverage to avoid lost sales given sustained high demand, while sigma captures risk to temper over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sustained since Period 26: avg demand P26-33 = 121.0 vs historical mean 62.6 (+93%), sustained over 8 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=531 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Promised lead time = 4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4, so use default promised L to keep OR backend aligned. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (use last 8 concluded demand samples P26-33) so the base-stock and cap capture current elevated mean and volatility and avoid under-ordering while the large in-transit buffer reduces risk of stockouts.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (avg P26-33 = 121 units/week). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 668 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms the observed lead time = 4 from concluded arrivals. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (periods 26-33) so the base-stock reflects the current elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Historical baseline mean=62.6 (Jan 2019). Since Period 26 demand jumped and has remained high; using recent data to forecast. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so keep promised/default. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the detected high-demand regime (Periods 26-36, regime_length=11) so mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples to capture the sustained elevated demand (avg P26-36 \u2248132.3 units/week). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=11 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These parameters raise base-stock to meet the much higher, sustained demand while the capped order cap still limits extreme over-ordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sustained since Period 26: avg demand P26-36 = 132.27 vs historical mean 62.6 (+111%), sustained over 11 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (avg ~132 over P26-36 with multiple confirmations through P37) and actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods in prior concludes. On-hand is 0 with 611 units in-transit (pipeline). I keep L at promised/default (4) since concluded messages consistently confirm LT=4. For demand I use recent_N to capture the new high regime (use last 11 periods of the regime P26-36) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect volatility in the same window. This increases order targets to meet the sustained elevated demand while the pipeline is considered by the OR engine.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Current on-hand=63, in-transit=578. Historical observed lead times are consistently 4 (arrivals from orders placed 4 periods prior); no overdue/lost shipments visible. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (avg P26-38 \u2248 high; recent sustained elevated demand). To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set L to promised/default (4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (covers Periods 26\u201338, regime length 13) so the OR backend computes demand across review+lead using the most relevant high-demand samples and corresponding volatility. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts while the capped policy limits extreme orders to control holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (elevated weekly sales well above historical mean). On-hand=140, in-transit=473 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculate to let backend confirm average. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (14 most recent concluded demand periods, P26\u2013P39) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the higher mean and volatility. This supports a high service target (profit/holding -> q=0.8) while the large pipeline reduces aggressive ordering risk.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 26 (sustained high demand through Period 40). On-hand=127, in-transit=504 (pipeline substantial). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set L to promised (default) and use recent_N over the full sustained regime for demand estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent higher mean and volatility (N=16 covers Period26-41 window length ~16). This balances service (higher target stock) against holding cost given sizeable pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with W=4) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (elevated avg demand across P26-P41). On-hand=114 + in-transit=523 provides solid pipeline coverage, but demand remains well above historical baseline so forecast should use recent data. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (confirmed =4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime (N=16 covers Periods 26\u201341) so the OR backend raises base-stock and caps appropriately to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed variability.

Pipeline+on-hand covers multiple weeks but recent demand regime is much higher than original historical sample mean, so I use a lead-time estimate computed from observations and demand estimates based on the recent high-demand regime. Set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 (Period 26\u201342) to capture the sustained elevated mean/volatility and to ensure base-stock targets increase service while limiting excess cap-based orders.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Current on-hand=136, in-transit=544. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P arrivals with W=4). Demand regime has been elevated and sustained since Period 26 (high-demand regime length = 18 periods from P26\u2013P43). To reflect this sustained higher demand, set L to promised default (4) and use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend estimates mean/volatility from the sustained high-demand regime (covers review+lead). This ensures orders cover the elevated demand while capping order size via the OR cap to limit excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4 (q=0.8 => high service level but still mindful of holding cost).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 45 (2019-12-16). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (P26-P44, 19 weeks of elevated demand). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4) and use recent_N with N=19 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the most relevant 19-sample regime. Current on-hand (167) + in-transit (461) = 628 units, which comfortably covers 5 periods of the elevated recent average; using recent_N informs the backend base_stock and the capped order to avoid excess holding while preserving service level given high demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (several periods showing avg >> historical). Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand=140 and in-transit=468 (pipeline=608) \u2014 ample coverage vs (1+L)=5 review+lead periods but we must respect the high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length P26\u2013P45 = 20 periods), giving mu_hat based on the last 20 samples across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the elevated demand while keeping variability estimates tied to recent behavior, balancing service level (profit forgone by stockouts) against holding cost.
