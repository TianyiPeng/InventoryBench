Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Recent sample demand (5 weekly samples) mean = 10.6 units/wk; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected. No concluded arrivals observed to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) L=4 because no evidence to revise it. Use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples (5*10.6=53.0) and default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility across all samples. These defaults balance service level and holding cost given limited data and no lead-time signal.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~10.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=18 (order placed Period 1). No concluded arrivals beyond Period 1, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Use default lead time (promised L=4) so backend will compute (1+L)*mean demand and volatility from full sample set. This keeps forecasts stable given limited history and avoids overreacting to one outstanding shipment; it balances service level (covering 5 periods of demand) vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent observed demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~10.6 units/week; no concluded arrivals yet but in-transit = 47 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time is 4 and there is no concluded evidence to change it. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures baseline demand of ~53 units over review+lead period while keeping safety stock calibrated by historical volatility). This balances service level given profitable margin ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples mean=10.6 (samples: 9,6,16,8,14). On-hand=0, in-transit=96 (matches total ordered P1-P3 = 18+29+49). No concluded arrivals yet; by rules we may not infer actual lead time until arrivals are observed. Use promised lead time (default) so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) against low holding cost (held units are inexpensive) while avoiding premature lengthening of lead time based on unconcluded shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=156. Historical weekly mean (Jan samples) ~10.6, but most recent 4 weeks (Periods 1-4) show much higher demand: 30,55,59,43 -> recent mean 46.75. No concluded arrivals for any orders placed in Periods 1-4 (all arrived=0), indicating shipments are delayed or lost; therefore I estimate lead time longer than promised. I set L explicit to 6 to hedge against extended delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase forecasted pipeline target to meet elevated demand while acknowledging higher lead time risk and limiting overordering via the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 all show arrived=0 (ordered=18,29,49,60) \u2014 sustained non-arrival over 4 periods, suggesting lead time > promised or lost shipments; Demand regime shift: recent 4-period avg demand=46.75 vs historical mean=10.6 (+340%), sustained across 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=207. Period 5 conclude shows arrival from Period 1 with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 4. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (recent 4-period regime avg=46.75 vs historical mean\u224810.6), so use recent demand samples to set forecast and volatility. Choose L via calculate (use observed lead times). Use mu_hat recent_N N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime across the review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect increased recent volatility and avoid understocking given confirmed longer lead time and high demand. These settings prioritize service (profit) while controlling holding cost by using recent regime statistics.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted sharply up: last 4 observed demands (Periods 3-6) = 59, 43, 42, 70 (mean=53.5). Pipeline = 242 (orders from P3-P6) and on-hand=0. Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed=4). For demand I use recent_N N=4 to capture the new higher regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples (with L determined by backend). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices align ordering to the sustained higher demand while the confirmed lead time avoids underordering given long pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5; Period2 order arrived in Period6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand jumped sharply (notably Period 7 demand=272) indicating a new, higher-demand regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=269 which partially covers upcoming demand but demand volatility is higher. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new regime (most recent 4 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock and safety stock reflect the surge and higher variance, balancing increased service level against holding cost given profit/holding ($19/$1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has jumped sharply and persistently (Periods 5-8 demands = 42,70,272,253). On-hand=0, in-transit=499 (these in-transit arrivals reflect orders with confirmed lead time=4). I treat lead time as promised (4) because concludes confirm L=4. Demand regime changed \u2014 use recent_N=4 to capture the new high mean/variance for (1+L)-period demand aggregation so the OR base-stock and cap reflect current heavy demand and avoid stockouts while capping over-ordering given holding cost. Therefore: L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=4, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=787. Historical concluded lead times confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted sharply upward starting Period 7 (three sustained high-demand periods: 272,253,163), so forecast and volatility should be based on the most recent regime. Choose recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand mean and increased variability. This balances service (high fill needed to capture profit $19) against holding cost $1 by aligning base-stock to the current high-demand regime while pipeline (787) will moderate immediate ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand P7-P9 = 229.33 vs historical mean ~10.6 (+~2062%), sustained over 3 periods

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Demand has moved to a high regime beginning Period 7 (P7-P10 avg \u2248 214+, sustained 4 periods) and observed lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals showing W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1049 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals follow L=4 timing. I set L using calculate to reflect confirmed observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (capture the sustained high-demand regime P7-P10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the new regime, which raises base stock to meet elevated demand while balancing holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=1203. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand has shifted sharply up starting Period 7: recent demands P7-P11 = [272,253,163,169,168], recent 5-period avg \u2248205 vs historical mean \u224810.6. To reflect confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' for L (backend will compute observed average). To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on P7-P11). This biases orders toward meeting elevated weekly demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend raise the base-stock to satisfy the sustained high demand while keeping holding cost considered via the backend formula.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has been at a new high since Period 7 (P7-P12 demands = 272,253,163,169,168,227; recent average >> historical). On-hand=63, in-transit=930 \u2014 ample pipeline but many large orders placed earlier; concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 so use observed lead time. Set L via calculate to lock in confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the sustained high-demand regime (P7\u2013P12). This balances service (capture elevated demand) vs holding cost by basing base_stock on the new regime statistics rather than long-run low historical mean.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5..P13). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained high weekly demand; recent demands P10-P13 = [169,168,227,141], avg=176.25). On-hand=279, in-transit=801 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand remains elevated. I set L by "calculate" to reflect observed lead times (average of observed =4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of recent 4 weeks). For volatility I use recent_N (N=4) so safety stock reflects current variability. These choices align the downstream OR base-stock calculation to prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while the large pipeline limits excessive new ordering.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime established at Period 7 (sustained high weekly demand P7\u2013P14). Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Current availability: on-hand=399, in-transit=475 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand but recent weekly demand has been high (several 100s). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set L by calculation (uses observed lead times) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 weeks (the post-changepoint regime P7\u2013P14). This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts under the new regime) while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; using recent data avoids diluting forecasts with pre-regime low demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 7 (weeks P7\u2013P15) with large weekly demand (many >140) and observed arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=427 and in-transit=523 (pipeline total 950) \u2014 ample coverage vs elevated demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all observed = 4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent data reflecting the new regime: use recent_N with N=9 (Period7\u201315) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the high-demand regime and keep service levels appropriate while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (many large weekly demands) and observed lead times consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand=235, in-transit=719 (ample pipeline). To reflect confirmed lead time I select calculate (average observed = 4). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N=10 (covering Periods 7\u201316) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent elevated regime. This balances service (high demand persists) while cap and holding cost will limit excessive ordering given large existing pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 7 (P7-P17 elevated vs pre-P7). On-hand=322 and in-transit=696 provide strong coverage but demand regime persists; observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time history. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) covering Periods 7-17 to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock forecast with the confirmed regime shift and consistent lead time, improving service while avoiding excess stock from outdated low-demand stats.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand regime (since Period 7) is substantially higher than historical pre-shock levels; lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=159 + in-transit=816 provides ample coverage vs elevated demand, and there are no additional missing shipments beyond earlier resolved delays. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed avg lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 7 onward (gives (1+L)\xd7mean over most recent regime). Sigma also uses recent_N N=12 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices ensure the backend computes a base-stock that targets the higher service level justified by the large profit vs holding cost while using recent regime statistics to avoid understating demand or overstocking for the old low-demand regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 7 (much larger than the Jan samples). On-hand=285 + in-transit=684 gives strong pipeline coverage but demand regime since P7 is the correct basis for forecasting. Observed concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods when arrivals occurred; no sustained evidence of longer or lost lead time currently. Therefore keep L=default (promised=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N covering the current high-demand regime (N=13, Periods 7\u201319) so the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the elevated demand and variance while the cap limits excess ordering given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): on-hand=360, in-transit=606. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 7; the most relevant recent stable window is Periods 12-20 (9 samples) with mean demand well above historical pre-spike levels. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent elevated demand/volatility, set L via calculate (avg observed lead times = 4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (captures Periods 12-20 demand behavior). This balances higher target base-stock to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand regime shifted up sharply starting Period 7 (sustained high weekly demand through Period 21). Pipeline (on-hand 438 + in-transit 442 = 880) is healthy versus recent weekly demand, but elevated demand regime persists. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=15) to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 7 onward (regime length ~15 periods), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=15) to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices keep service high under the new regime while avoiding excessive ordering driven by older low-demand samples.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 and a sustained high-demand regime earlier, but current on-hand (454) plus in-transit (515) = 969 units is ample vs recent weekly demand (100\u2013250). No evidence of new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in the last 3+ periods. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across historical samples; this avoids overreacting to recent spikes while the pipeline remains large and holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has settled well above historical pre-spike levels: last 8 demands (P16-P23) average ~143 units/week. On-hand=489 + in-transit=369 = 858 units total pipeline; with promised lead time=4 and current weekly demand ~143, (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*143 \u2248 715 expected demand over review+lead, so pipeline currently covers ~1.2\xd7 that, providing a modest buffer. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; no new lead-time delays. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (consistent with observed confirms). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher-demand regime (stable over many periods) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated mean over the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility for appropriate safety stock, limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained large weekly sales) but observed lead times have repeatedly been 4 periods (multiple concluded messages). On-hand=551 + in-transit=234 gives ample coverage versus recent weekly demand (~100-250 range); no currently overdue shipments visible. I set L=calculate to lock to observed average lead time (confirmed=4). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical sample mean and volatility as baseline; this balances service level given confirmed L while avoiding overfit to recent spikes given existing large on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and no new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint. Current position: on-hand=514, in-transit=283 (total pipeline+on-hand=797) \u2014 ample cover vs recent weekly demand (~70-200). To avoid excess holding cost while the lead time remains 4, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses historical sample mean/variance; this is conservative given high inventory and no new sustained signal.

Demand has fallen from the extreme spike earlier and settled into a lower, variable regime\u2014I bias the forecast toward recent observations using an EWMA (gamma=0.3) to emphasize latest weeks while retaining some memory. For volatility I use recent_N=10 to capture current demand spread. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to recent demand declines while the large on-hand + pipeline reduces ordering urgency, limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Demand has been elevated vs the 2019-Jan historical baseline and stabilized after the large spike earlier in Apr\u2013May; on-hand=555, in-transit=157. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (no new evidence of loss). I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the full sample history, which balances service level (given sustained higher demand) against holding cost with no new confirmed regime change since prior insights.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has moderated to ~65-85 units/week (Periods 26-28: 67,85,65) after the large spike earlier in the year; lead time evidence in concluded history consistently shows 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving with W=4). On-hand = 490, in-transit = 290 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample versus recent demand but we must still plan for (1+L) review+lead coverage. I set L to default (use promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm a 4-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-spike stabilized demand regime and avoid contamination from the early low-demand history pre-spike. I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the recent, higher mean demand while keeping service-level sizing grounded in recent variability; they also avoid overreacting to the early small-sample historical means or the isolated large spike periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has returned to moderate levels after the early high-spike regime; last 4 observed demands = [67,85,65,40], avg ~64.25. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent stable lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 4 periods; set sigma_hat using recent_N on last 4 periods to capture current volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock vs. using the long-run or spike-era mean, lowering holding cost while keeping enough pipeline for (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence. I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat=recent_N (N=8) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8) to base the replenishment target on the most recent demand regime (avoiding early low-sample January data and the transient spring spike), so the OR backend will compute a base-stock appropriate to current demand and recent variability while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has stabilized well below earlier spikes: last 5 demands = [85,65,40,43,39], recent mean \u224854.4. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; no new evidence of loss. On-hand (525) + in-transit (236) = 761 units provides healthy coverage but demand remains elevated versus the 2019-Jan samples, so I use a recent-window forecast to reflect the current regime while keeping promised lead time. Selected L=default to trust the promised 4-period lead time (backed by many observed 4-period arrivals). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L) by the recent mean demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating demand from early extreme spikes and keep orders aligned with current observed demand and low holding cost.

Historical data show a sustained higher-demand regime in recent weeks: recent 5-week mean demand \u224845.8 vs long-run ~10.6. Lead times observed in concluded messages have consistently been 4 periods. To capture the recent regime and short-term volatility while respecting confirmed lead time evidence, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 samples (recent_N N=5). This biases orders to cover the elevated recent demand (improving fill rates) while sigma based on recent variability prevents extreme safety stock given holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=19, holding=1).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has settled around ~40-50 units/week (last 5 periods: 40,43,39,42,50; mean ~42.8). On-hand=669, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock cover for multiple weeks, no outstanding arrivals overdue. Actual lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use promised/default lead time to keep model aligned. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime and lower volatility, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures current mean over the last 5 weeks) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures recent variability). This raises the backend base stock to meet current demand while the large on-hand inventory limits additional ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07 (Period 35). Recent demand has stabilized well above the original historical baseline: last 8 periods (P27\u2013P34) average demand \u224850.25/week. On-hand=631, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover now but we must anchor forecasts to the recent higher-demand regime. Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent demand regime (most recent 8 periods) to reflect the sustained higher mean/volatility and avoid understocking if demand persists. This balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) by increasing target base-stock to meet higher realized demand while capping orders via the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg demand P27\u2013P34 = 50.25 vs historical mean \u224810.6 (+\u2248373%), sustained over 8 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=613, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals); no new missing-shipment signals. Inventory is ample vs recent demand, so keep demand forecasting broad (use all samples) while letting backend compute base-stock with high service-factor (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95). Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, avoiding overfitting to short-term noise and relying on existing large on-hand stock to meet near-term demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes: last 8 observed demands (P29\u2013P36) average ~37.75 units/week versus historical pre-spike mean ~10.6; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To balance service and holding cost given high on-hand (581) and 153 in-transit, I use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecasts based on the most recent regime (recent_N=8) to capture the current moderated-but-elevated demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces over-ordering from older high-spike periods while maintaining service for the current elevated demand level and accounting for the 4-period pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=558, in-transit=153. Recent demand (P31\u2013P37 = 39,42,50,38,18,32,23) averages ~34.6/week, much lower than earlier spikes and consistent for 7 periods. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; use promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime while capturing recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covers the last 7 observed demands, (1+L) factor applied by backend). This keeps orders aligned to current demand and avoids excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): on-hand=545, in-transit=153. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; pipeline looks healthy (total available 698) and recent finished-period demand has been low (P35\u2013P38 = 18,32,23,13). I select L by calculation to reflect observed lead-time evidence. To keep orders aligned with the recent lower demand regime while still responsive, I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (capture last 4 demand observations). These params reduce excess ordering vs long-run averages while the backend caps orders; no new sustained lost-shipment or regime-change insight to record.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead-time evidence: concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time across multiple orders \u2192 use observed average. Recent demand has declined from earlier spikes; last 7 concluded demands (Periods 33\u201339) = [50,38,18,32,23,13,16], mean \u224827.7, so set demand forecast based on these recent periods to reflect the current lower regime. On-hand=529 and in-transit=153 provide ample coverage; choosing recent-based \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 prevents overreacting to earlier spikes while allowing OR backend to compute a service-level oriented base stock given profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Recent demand (P35\u2013P40 = 18,32,23,13,16,15) shows a sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier spikes; lead-time history consistently shows 4 when arrivals occur. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and recent lower demand, keep L = promised (default) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent 6 demand observations (captures current lower regime and reduced volatility). This reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=652, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 34 (P34\u2013P41 demands: 38,18,32,23,13,16,15,15) \u2014 no new sustained spike. Many past periods showed regime shifts (recorded in carry-over), but current short-term demand is low. Given large on-hand inventory (covers many weeks at current demand) I choose to keep promised lead time and base forecasts on the recent short-window to avoid further over-ordering. Methods: L=default to use promised lead time (4); mu_hat recent_N uses last N=8 periods to reflect current lower demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. This reduces ordering relative to long-run/high-spike regimes and balances service vs holding cost given high on-hand stock.

To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised/confirmed lead time default and base stock computed from a recent-window demand estimate. Selected L=default to reflect confirmed 4-period lead; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent lower-demand regime while providing modest safety stock.

Current recent demand has returned near historical levels and existing inventory is very high; therefore use default demand/volatility stats so OR backend scales orders down. Choices: L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This avoids adding more inventory given large on-hand+pipeline and balances service vs holding cost.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overordering given large on-hand, keep promised lead time and use recent demand stats (last 11 periods P36\u2013P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts the current low-demand regime and reduces replenishment.
