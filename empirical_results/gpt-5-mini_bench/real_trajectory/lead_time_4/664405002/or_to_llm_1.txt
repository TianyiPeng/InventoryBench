  "rationale": "Lead time inference: actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed historically). Inventory: on-hand=1, in-transit=406 => pipeline+on-hand=407 units. Demand view: OR recommends 83 but uses long-run history; recent longer-term regime shows demand down vs historical and past months support lower demand; there was a one-off large spike (308 in Period 42) likely promotional/holiday. Decision logic: with L=4 we must cover current period plus next 4 periods. Ordering now would arrive in Period 50 and be added to pipeline; given large existing pipeline (407) and holding cost equal to profit ($1), incremental units carry full period holding cost and reduce profit per unit if excess. Risk balance: avoid adding inventory given substantial in-transit stock and equal profit/holding (critical fractile 0.5). Action: do not place new order (0 units) to avoid overstock and holding cost; monitor upcoming concludes to confirm arrivals and revise if pipeline shortfalls appear.",
