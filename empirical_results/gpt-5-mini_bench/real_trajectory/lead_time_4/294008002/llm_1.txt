Product is a regular-season viscose jersey top; demand should follow recent weekly sales.\nb) Demand regime analysis: Historical weekly sales for SKU 294008002: 2019-01-07:43, 01-14:55, 01-21:46, 01-28:53, 02-04:59. 5-period average = 51.2 units/week. Most recent realized observation (Period 1 label) = 47, consistent with this range. No evidence of a sustained regime shift.\nc) Lead time / orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time.\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Because arrivals occur after a 4-period lead and current period demand still occurs after ordering, plan to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the 5-period avg demand (51.2) yields target pipeline = 51.2 * 5 \u2248 256 units. Minimal safety stock is appropriate given stable recent data and holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit.\ne) Final order logic: Place order to cover 5 periods demand \u2248 256 units. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during 4-period lead) with holding cost; adjust in future periods when arrival/conclude messages reveal actual lead time or demand shifts.",

No concluded arrivals => cannot confirm actual lead time or lost orders (need concluded evidence, and rule requires 3+ periods of consistent signal for durable updates). Inventory assessment: On-hand=0 so we will stockout this period and cannot satisfy demand regardless of any new order (new orders arrive after 4 periods). The in-transit 300 will cover several future weeks if they arrive as promised (300 vs recent weekly demand 66\u201388 implies ~3\u20135 weeks coverage). Risk: demand may be elevated but evidence is limited. Ordering decision: Given long lead time, substantial in-transit inventory, and holding cost ($1/unit/period) that penalizes excess ending inventory, avoid placing additional orders now to reduce risk of overstock if shipments arrive.
