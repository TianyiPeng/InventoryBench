Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Product is a seasonal garment; recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable volumes (mean=51.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates: L default to promised (4), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (covering L+1 periods) with low holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 .. 2019-02-04) have mean 51.2 units and std \u22486.57. No concluded arrivals yet (Period1 order of 63 not arrived in Period1 conclude), so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=63 which is well below the (L+1)-period demand; use default lead time and default demand stats to let OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding over-committing given limited evidence of lead-time shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~51.2 units/week; recent concluded periods (P1,P2) show ordered=63,68 but arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet. On-hand=0 and in-transit=131 (equals sum of prior orders), so shipments are outstanding but actual lead time cannot be inferred with only two conclude messages. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=4) and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This is conservative given limited evidence of lead-time or demand regime change and lets the engine apply its capped ordering rule while avoiding premature regime adjustments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=215 (orders from P1-P3). No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3; this is concerning but promised lead time is 4 and we only have 3 periods of non-arrival\u2014insufficient to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Historical demand mean=51.2 (5 samples). Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently, avoiding premature adjustments given limited evidence.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples: [43,55,46,53,59], mean=51.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=299 units. No concluded arrivals in any prior period so actual lead time is unconfirmed; shipments may be delayed but not yet proven lost. Using default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility preserves the backend's statistical forecast: (1+L)\xd7mean covers ~5 weeks = 256 units, and current pipeline (299) modestly exceeds that, so no aggressive increase needed. Defaults balance service level (prevent stockouts while in-transit inventory is sufficient) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed arrival: Period 5 concluded that the order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=301 units (large pipeline). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5): [66,88,70,77,64], mean \u224873 \u2014 materially above the older Jan samples. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4 signal. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current, higher-demand regime across the last 5 periods when choosing the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variability; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend builds a base stock appropriate for the confirmed lead time and the elevated recent demand while the large in-transit inventory will cap net ordering via the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=63 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=323. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = promised 4 (arrivals from P1\u2192P5 and P2\u2192P6). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20136) averages 73.33, substantially above the older sample mean 51.2 (2019-01 samples). I detect a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 1 (6 periods of higher demand). Therefore: keep L as default (use promised lead time=4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent regime to capture the higher mean; choose N=6 (regime length=6, capped rules). For volatility use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent variation. These choices raise base_stock to meet higher demand across the review+lead period while using recent volatility to keep safety stock appropriate and limit excess holding given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: historical sample mean=51.2 (Jan samples) \u2192 recent Periods1\u20136 mean=73.33 (+43%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=315 (orders from Periods 4\u20137: 84+65+90+76). Observed concluded arrivals show lead time = 4 for three successive orders (Periods 1\u21925, 2\u21926, 3\u21927); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (will be 4). Demand has shifted up and sustained: recent Periods1\u20136 mean demand = 73.33 vs historical sample mean 51.2 (+43%) \u2014 use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the new regime. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base stock to cover the longer-observed demand level while accounting for confirmed lead time and current pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=2, in-transit=327. Actual lead time confirmed = 4 (arrivals from P1\u2013P4 concluded as LT=4). Recent demand has shifted up and been sustained (6 periods). To reflect confirmed LT and higher recent demand, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 demand observations (captures the new higher-demand regime and limits influence of older low-Jan samples). This balances service (higher mu_hat) versus holding cost by using a recent-sample estimate rather than full-history average.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift (recent avg \u224873.3 > historical 51.2). On-hand=11, in-transit=355 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple lead cycles but some past orders were delayed then arrived with 4-period lag. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the new higher-demand regime (N=6 chosen = recent regime length), which helps the OR backend size base-stock to meet higher service needs while capping orders given existing pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Demand has shifted up and been sustained for 6 periods (recent mean ~73.33 vs historical 51.2). To reflect confirmed lead time use calculate (average observed =4). To capture the new higher-demand regime use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine stocks for the elevated demand while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Observed actual lead time = 4 (confirmed by concluded arrivals P5\u2013P11); demand has shifted up and remained elevated for 6 recent periods (recent mean \u224873.3 vs historical 51.2). On-hand 32 + in-transit 273 provides cover; using L=calculate to lock in observed lead time, and using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost impact explicit via sigma_hat.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime vs. historical Jan mean. On-hand=28 + in-transit=295 provides multi-period coverage, but pipeline will arrive with 4-period lag so parameters must reflect elevated recent demand. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime observed in the most recent 6 periods (keeps forecast and safety stock responsive). Sigma set recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given 4-period actual lead time) while keeping holding cost in mind by limiting horizon to the recent regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=30, in-transit=327. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand has shifted upward and sustained (recent Periods 1\u20136 mean=73.33 vs historical Jan mean=51.2). To reflect the confirmed L=4 and the recent higher-demand regime, set L to the promised/default and forecast using the most recent regime (N=6) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine raises target base-stock to maintain service (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a high target service level) while limiting excess inventory by using recent samples rather than all historical data.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=396. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history and recent demand shows a sustained upward regime (recent mean \u224873.33 vs historical 51.2). To protect service level under the higher demand regime while keeping holding costs reasonable, use the promised/default lead time and base demand on the recent regime. Therefore: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat based on the most recent N=6 samples to capture the regime shift, and sigma_hat based on the most recent N=6 samples to reflect increased volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand but keeps cap controls via the OR engine.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=506. Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (confirmed). Recent demand has risen materially; last 6 period demands = [37,108,100,91,121,126], mean=97.17. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actuals. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, aligning stock to the elevated demand while avoiding overstating long-run variance. With (1+L)=5, recent demand coverage \u2248 5\xd797.17=485.8, which is roughly equal to on-hand+in-transit (506), so pipeline is appropriate; using recent stats keeps safety stock responsive to the new regime and limits holding cost growth.

On-hand=0, in-transit=487 (covers multiple future periods). To capture the recent higher demand, I use recent_N methods (last 6 periods) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the upshift; keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals confirm it. This balances service (higher mu_hat raises base stock) against holding cost by limiting change to recent data only.

Recent demand (Periods 13-18) shows a higher regime: last 6 demands avg \u2248118.2 units. To align ordering with the elevated recent demand while respecting promised lead time, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to target (1+L)-period demand under the current high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capturing current high demand) against holding cost given sizable pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=494. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages). Recent demand is materially higher than early-Jan samples; last 6 demand observations (Periods 14\u201319) average ~131.8 units/week, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I choose L by 'calculate' to capture the empirically observed lead time (avg of observed lead times \u22484). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 to target the most recent sustained regime (1+L=5 review+lead coverage will be applied by backend). I use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock consistent with the confirmed higher demand while letting the capped order logic limit excessive orders given pipeline inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=21, in-transit=564. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime vs. the small Jan sample. Pipeline (564) is large relative to one-cycle demand so risk of excess stock exists, but service requires accounting for confirmed L=4. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime detected in recent periods (focus model on latest 6 observations to capture regime and limit dilution from small early sample). These parameters bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while keeping volatility estimates local to recent behavior, helping the OR backend balance service level vs. holding cost given the large pipeline.

Use promised lead time (default=4) and capture the recent elevated demand by using recent_N for forecast and volatility with N=6 (most recent 6 demand periods cover the confirmed regime). This raises base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime while sigma_recent increases safety stock for variability; using recent_N limits influence of older low-demand samples and helps backend balance service level vs holding cost given strong pipeline.

Historical data shows a sustained demand regime increase (recent mean \u224873.33 over last 6 recent periods). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concldues. To reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N=6 for demand forecasts so mu_hat reflects the last 6-period average scaled by (1+L). sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. L left as default (promised 4) since concluded history confirms 4. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher recent demand while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety stock and avoids overstock given a large on-hand+in-transit buffer.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Historical Jan sample mean=51.2 but recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 1\u20136 recent mean=73.33, +43%) and actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand=217, in-transit=383 (pipeline total=600) \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains elevated. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT=4.

These parameters ensure the OR backend sizes base stock for (1+L) periods using the elevated recent demand and adjusts safety stock for the higher observed variance, balancing service level against holding cost given high per-unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=442, in-transit=37 \u2014 inventory is ample vs. recent demand. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained). Recent demand has moderated vs. early spike; last 6 demand periods (P21\u2013P26) avg \u224859.3 units, so I focus forecasting on this recent regime. Set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time average (4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable regime, reducing overstock risk. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-variance periods. These choices keep service for current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 22\u201327 = 52,68,39,74,44,65) suggests a moderate post-peak regime; I use a recent_N window to capture current mean/volatility rather than the older January samples. L kept as promised (default=4) to match observed arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) to adapt to the most recent demand regime and balance service level vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=350, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed). Demand has been in a higher regime recently (sustained higher mean over recent periods). To keep service high while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time and base mu/sigma on the recent elevated demand window. L set to default (promised=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (reduces risk of understock during review+lead window). This balances higher profit per unit ($19) against $1 holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand rather than long-run lower mean.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=306, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in prior conclude messages). Recent demand (Periods 25-29) = [74,44,65,64,44] \u2192 mean\u224858.2; prior sustained higher regime noted earlier but last 5 weeks show moderate demand. I keep L at promised/confirmed value to match observed arrivals. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to weight the most recent regime (captures short-term demand while allowing one extra period), and sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will tell the OR engine to target a base-stock tuned to recent demand while avoiding excess holding given large on-hand inventory (on-hand already covers several weeks of demand), reducing likelihood of unnecessary large orders.

On-hand=281, in-transit=23 \u2014 ample cover vs. expected demand but avoid excess holding. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use inferred lead time. Set L via calculate to lock 4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align forecasts with the sustained higher-demand regime and limit influence of older low-demand samples; this tightens service-level sizing while controlling holding cost given already-large on-hand.

Recent weekly demand (last ~6\u201310 weeks) is roughly at historical baseline (~50 units/week) after prior mid-year spike; no new sustained changepoint (needs 3+ periods of consistent shift) is evident. Several recent orders placed (Periods 30\u201333) have not yet concluded but are within the confirmed 4-period lead time, so no evidence of lost shipments beyond expected. Given confirmed lead time and no new sustained demand regime, use default population estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock with full-sample mean/STD scaled by (1+L), balancing service level and holding cost conservatively.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=119, in-transit=353. Promised L=4 has been repeatedly confirmed by concluded arrivals (consistent 4-period arrivals). Recent analysis: earlier carry-over identified a sustained demand regime shift (regime length = 6 periods). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent shifted regime (N=6). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean reflecting the higher recent demand and matching recent volatility for safety.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime vs. historical Jan samples; on-hand=185 and in-transit=277 (total pipeline=462) which comfortably covers several periods. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L to calculate (average observed lead time = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the confirmed higher recent regime (6-period regime), and sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the higher demand while the large current pipeline limits new order size and holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime vs the old Jan baseline. On-hand 304 + in-transit 149 = 453 units, which provides cushion vs forecasted demand over review+lead. I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current higher-demand regime (focus on most recent 6 weeks rather than long-run Jan samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base stock tuned to the new regime and limit excess holding by not using long-run low-demand mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=434, in-transit=8. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201339) is low (demands: 16,18,13,10,9,11) indicating a sustained down-shift vs earlier high-season volumes. To avoid excess holding cost while covering near-term demand, use the promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the recent 6 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Confirmed lead time=4 from prior concluded messages and on-hand=430, in-transit=0. Demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime (Periods 1\u20136 recent mean=73.33, ~+43% vs historical Jan mean). To capture the sustained higher demand I use recent_N=6 for demand forecast and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime; L uses promised (default) since lead time is confirmed as 4 and no evidence of further change. Choosing recent_N=6 (regime length=6, within allowed bounds) biases orders toward service (higher \u03bc\u0302) while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-11-25 (Period 42). Current on-hand=422, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand in the history (Periods 30\u201341) is low (~8\u201325/week) compared with the Jan training samples; carry-over previously confirmed actual lead time=4 and an earlier demand regime shift from the Jan samples. Given large on-hand (422) and zero pipeline, placing more stock would increase holding cost with limited incremental sales. Use default promised lead time to align with supplier promise and historical observed LT=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from the full sample set, avoiding overfitting to short recent noise and preventing excess inventory buildup.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=406, in-transit=38. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P arrivals with W=4). Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime (recent Periods1\u20136 mean=73.33 vs historical Jan mean=51.2), so I use a recent-window forecast. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4 signal. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime length=6; N = max(min(6,20),3)=6) so the backend targets the higher recent demand and adjusts safety stock accordingly while limiting cap through its capping rule. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given large on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=389, in-transit=38 \u2014 very large stock relative to recent weekly demand. Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (no change vs promised). Recent demand (last ~6 weeks) is markedly lower than mid-year peaks, so I bias the forecast to the recent low regime to avoid additional inventory. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and reduce ordering given high on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=379, in-transit=38. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained increase over earlier baseline). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (confirmed =4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to capture the higher demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=6 (recent regime length=6 periods of sustained higher demand as noted) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 samples, which raises target base-stock to improve service while the capped order limit prevents excessive over-ordering given current pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods in historical concludes; use calculated L to reflect observed lead times. Recent demand has dropped sharply in Dec (last 6 concluded demands: 8,16,17,10,26,17; sustained low level), so set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid excess replenishment given high on-hand (374) + in-transit (52). Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost by lowering forecasted demand during the current low season while keeping lead-time estimate grounded in observations.
