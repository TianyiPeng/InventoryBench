Demand outlook: recent sustained regime (Periods 38\u201344) shows a decline to ~47 units/week, but Period 45 spike (102) and calendar date (2019-12-23, pre-Christmas) imply elevated short-term demand risk. Requirement: cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the conservative recent regime (47/wk) \u2192 5-period demand \u2248 235 units, so pipeline+on-hand is short by ~101 units. OR recommended 163 (uses longer-horizon historical mean and promised L) which would overshoot given the recent sustained decline but would protect against a holiday spike. Decision: place an order of 100 units \u2014 this fills the ~101-unit gap to cover five weeks under the recent low regime while limiting excess holding through the holiday week.
