Historical demand (weekly samples): 2019-01-07:31, 01-14:60, 01-21:70, 01-28:64, 02-04:68 -> recent mean \u224858.6/wk with upward stabilization after the low 31. No concluded arrival messages available yet, so actual lead time is unknown; supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Decision logic: With promised lead time L=4, we must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). Using a conservative forecast of 60 units/week (rounded from ~58.6) to protect service level, required coverage = 5 * 60 = 300 units. Holding cost equals profit, so avoid large overstock; 5-period cover balances service vs. holding given lack of pipeline. Therefore place order for 300 units.",
