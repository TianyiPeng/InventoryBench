{
  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from carry-over (P1\u2192P5 etc.). Inventory: on-hand=49, in-transit=300 \u2192 pipeline total=349. Requirement: need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand after ordering. Use conservative demand estimate = historical weekly mean 53.6 (carry-over notes a past downshift but recent holiday spikes are transient). 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd753.6 = 268 units. Pipeline 349 > 268, so no new order is needed and placing one would only increase holding costs (holding cost = profit = $1/unit). OR recommended 0; I follow that to avoid excess holding cost while meeting expected demand with current pipeline. Action: order 0 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 on-hand+in-transit (349) comfortably exceed 5-week conservative demand estimate (~268), and holding cost equals profit so avoid excess inventory.",
