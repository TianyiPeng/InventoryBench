Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is seasonal apparel (women's skinny trousers) with historical weekly demand samples (64,46,43,52,63). No arrive/conclude messages yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0) and no evidence of lead-time deviation or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and aggregate historical samples: select default L and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost given symmetric profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Product is seasonal apparel but no holiday signals in mid-February. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~53.6 and recent observed demand in Period 1 = 45. An order of 70 placed in Period 1 has not concluded (arrived=0), so there is no evidence actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. No sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected. Use defaults so the OR backend applies the promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics to compute base-stock while keeping policy simple given limited new data and potential in-transit uncertainty.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand weeks (historical samples 64,46,43,52,63 and recent concludes 45,60) show no sustained regime shift\u2014demand ~50\u201360. Both orders placed in P1 and P2 have not concluded; no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Keep L at default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to focus on the most relevant historical weekly samples (stabilizes forecast around current level). Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. On-hand 0 + in-transit 138 appears sufficient short-term but uncertain until arrivals conclude; chosen params balance service level vs holding cost by using a recent mean for demand and standard backend volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods show steady weekly demand samples (45,46,43,52,63 from history) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=206. Orders placed earlier have not concluded yet; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time so use promised lead time. Use default demand estimates to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). No explicit adjustment for overdue shipments because no concluded arrivals provide concrete lead-time evidence.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent observed weekly demand samples (historical) average \u224853.6 units/week (samples: 64,46,43,52,63). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. No concluded arrivals in periods 1\u20134 is expected given promised lead time mechanics (arrivals for orders placed earlier will be visible only in later conclude messages). No sustained changepoint in demand or confirmed lead-time shift (insufficient evidence). To let the OR backend apply its base-stock calculus using the promised lead time and full historical demand stats, I select default methods for L, mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Historical sample mean = 53.6/week (samples: 64,46,43,52,63). Concluded arrival shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 -> observed lead time = 4. On-hand 7 + in-transit 215 = 222 units currently in pipeline. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg observed = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples, which yields a 5-week demand forecast and standard deviation consistent with history. This balances service level (use confirmed lead time and full-sample forecast) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory; if future concludes show delayed or lost shipments I'll switch to recent_N or explicit estimates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order placed Period 1 arrived Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent on-hand=30, in-transit=213; two concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4. Recent demand (Periods 1-6) shows a higher mean (~58.8) than the older 5-sample historical set. Use observed lead time (calculate) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 6 periods to capture current demand regime and avoid underordering ahead of confirmed 4-period lead time. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 for 5-period coverage) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~53.6/week. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1,P2,P3 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=15, in-transit=197 provides significant pipeline coverage. I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times (average of concluded lead times = 4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which aligns the base-stock policy with the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise or the large current pipeline; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (P5=63,P6=45,P7=83,P8=96) but carry-over shows a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=208 (sizable pipeline). I choose L=default to trust the promised/confirmed lead time, mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=5; this balances service level given profit=holding cost and the existing large pipeline while avoiding overreacting to short noisy spikes. No explicit parameter values provided so backend computes base_stock and cap consistently with confirmed LT and historical stats.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=286 (covers several future periods). Demand history (seed samples 64,46,43,52,63) gives mean\u224853.6. I choose L by calculation to lock in the observed lead time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasting grounded in the full historical sample while the confirmed lead time ensures orders cover the full review+lead horizon and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=23, in-transit=234 covers multiple weeks but arrivals will only be visible next period. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean ~53.6. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed lead time of 4. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical sample set (stable pre-period seasonality) and avoids overreacting to recent variability while accounting for the 5-period review+lead horizon.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and demand samples (weeks in history) have mean 53.6. On-hand (31) + in-transit (220) = 251 vs default 5-period forecast ~268 (5\xd753.6) \u2014 a small shortfall (~17 units) but pipeline is large and lead time is stable. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies the long-run sample mean/variance (no recent regime change detected) and the 50% critical fractile (profit=holding) which balances service vs holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent conclude history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period 1\u21925 etc.). On-hand=72, in-transit=179 \u2192 total pipeline=251 units. Historical weekly sample mean=53.6 (samples: 64,46,43,52,63) \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248 268 units target; pipeline is slightly below that target but evidence is limited to the five historical weeks so I use default statistical aggregations. I therefore use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand variance assumptions to let the OR backend compute base_stock and capped order quantity using full-sample stats.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods) and no sustained demand regime shift; on-hand=117, in-transit=125. I keep L at the promised/default (4) consistent with observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit=holding => q=0.5) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise given healthy pipeline.

Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and on-hand=64 with in-transit=150. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) show mean ~53.6; with L=4 we protect (1+L) periods. Using default methods lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full history; this leverages all samples and the confirmed lead time to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 and high in-transit (182) with on-hand 0 after a large demand spike last period (demand=109). Use promised/confirmed lead time and aggregate historical demand (no recent sustained demand regime change). Choose default methods so backend uses L=4 and (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (stable estimate) while sigma uses full-sample volatility; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost = $1.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1->P5, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=235 units (large pipeline). Demand history shows no sustained regime change; no strong calendar spike in early June for this SKU. Use promised/default lead time so OR engine uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) because there is no demonstrated sustained demand shift and the in-transit volume already provides coverage. This balances service (maintain coverage given observed lead time) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts without evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=268. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 etc.), so set L by calculation to reflect observed data. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on all samples scaled by (1+L) because historical weekly mean (\u224853.6) is representative and no confirmed demand regime change meets the 3+ period sustained threshold. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for the observed 4-period lead time and avoids underordering or excessive holdings given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=4, in-transit=260. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in prior periods). Demand historical samples (Jan 2019 weekly: 64,46,43,52,63) will be used as baseline. I choose default L (promised lead time=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all samples to compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std. This leverages full-sample stability given no recent sustained demand regime shift, and with large in-transit inventory the policy will cap ordering to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent concluded history shows consistent observed lead_time = 4 (confirmed earlier) and weekly demands historically average ~53.6 (samples: 64,46,43,52,63). Current on-hand=19 + in-transit=220 = 239 units, which is slightly below the (1+L)-period demand estimate (~268), so pipeline is marginally short and a replenishment is appropriate. I keep L at the promised/default (4) since observed lead time has been stable; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the built-in cap handle order size vs. risk/holding tradeoff.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=120, in-transit=132. Historical demand samples (seed) show weekly mean ~53.6; lead time confirmed as 4 periods from prior conclude. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised/observed lead time and steady historical demand, use default L and default demand/volatility aggregations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This favors service (covers L+1 periods) while letting the OR cap limit excessive ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent sales history shows moderate weekly demand with historical sample mean ~53.6/week. On-hand=94, in-transit=108 (total pipeline=202) which covers ~3.8 weeks vs (1+L)=5 weeks of review+lead demand \u2014 some shortfall vs. expected demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; therefore use standard/default demand estimates so the OR backend (which knows promised L=4) computes base stock and caps appropriately. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps estimates anchored to long-run samples while letting the backend increase orders to replenish the observed shortfall.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=69, in-transit=135. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in carry-over). Profit and holding cost equal ($1 each) imply q=0.5 so target service level is moderate; use conservative, overall-history demand estimates. I select default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history and lets the backend apply its capped ordering policy given pipeline inventory to balance service vs. holding costs.

Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=46, in-transit=181. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 (recorded in carry-over). Pipeline + on-hand (227) comfortably covers multiple weeks of typical demand. Use conservative/default estimates so OR backend uses promised lead time and full historical demand moments: set L=default to keep consistent with observed lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using full-history mean) vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has averaged roughly mid-40s to 60s per week with no sustained regime shift; on-hand=3, in-transit=205 (pipeline ample). Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time (previously recorded), so use promised/default lead time and population-based demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat keep forecasting anchored to all available samples and avoid overreacting to noise while the large pipeline covers near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent conclude history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier) and strong pipeline: on-hand 7 + in-transit 219 = 226 units. Historical sample mean from provided series (~53.6/week) and no sustained recent demand regime change detected. Given high pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods and equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the large pipeline de-risks stockouts.

Recent demand history shows typical weekly demand in the 40\u201370 range (sample mean 53.6).

Pipeline plus on-hand is large relative to recent weekly demand, so I will use the promised/confirmed lead time and let the backend compute base_stock from full-sample statistics. Methods chosen (default) keep forecasting stable, avoid overreacting to recent demand noise, and limit extra holding given holding cost = profit.

=== Period 38 Summary ===
573937001: ordered=39, arrived=83 units (ordered on Period 34, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=83, demand=67, sold=67, ending on-hand inventory=16

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Demand history shows stable weekly sales with lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods (Period 6 conclusion). Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=179 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand, so no need to inflate forecast. I will use the promised/confirmed lead time and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical samples (default) so the base-stock is set by the engine's profit/holding tradeoff and historical demand variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals matching promised L=4). On-hand=3, in-transit=197 \u2014 strong pipeline coverage. No sustained demand regime shift detected; recent weekly demands fluctuate but align with historical mean. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and avoid overreacting to noise, use default lead time and default demand estimates so base stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages full-sample stats, maintains service with current large pipeline, and avoids unnecessary extra safety stock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Historical weekly mean demand ~53.6 (samples 64,46,43,52,63). On-hand=0, in-transit=212 which is below the (L+1)-period expected demand (~268 for L=4). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history so use default promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using full-sample statistics while respecting the confirmed L=4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=226. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand history appears stable without a recent sustained regime shift. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, holding=$1) implying a service quantile q=0.5; use conservative default statistics so OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/SD and confirmed promised lead time. Using defaults avoids overfitting to short-term noise and lets the backend cap orders appropriately given pipeline inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent conclude shows a one-period extreme demand spike (305 in Period 42) likely a single event (Black Friday/Promotions) not sustained; on-hand=0, in-transit=226. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). I choose to let the backend compute lead time from observed data and use default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples to set base-stock and caps; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1) and avoids overreacting to the single large spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weeks show two large spike demands (Periods 42=305, 43=157) likely holiday-driven but not yet a sustained regime (only 2 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=222 supports future demand but arrivals have consistently shown 4-period actual lead time historically. I therefore keep promised lead time and default demand stats: L=default to use promised (and matches observed actual LT=4), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (conservative vs. short-lived spike), sigma_hat=default to use overall volatility. This balances service (uses historical mean) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit and recent spike isn't yet confirmed sustained.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed). Recent demand shows a holiday spike (Periods 42-44 include very large sales: 305,157,51). To capture the elevated short-term demand while relying on confirmed lead time, set L to promised (default). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 weeks (captures the holiday uplift and recent variability) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while limiting excess from older low-demand periods. This choice balances service (avoid stockouts during holiday spike) against holding cost by using a short recent window.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=16, in-transit=491. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). No new sustained demand regime change detected that would justify deviating from defaults. Use promised lead time to keep alignment with concluded evidence; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost symmetry.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5). Demand baseline from provided samples has mean 53.6 units/week; with promised lead time 4 we apply default forecasting. Current on-hand=12 and in-transit=452 (ample pipeline). Use default L and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service (large pipeline) against holding costs without overriding observed lead-time or risking overreaction to recent spike/noise.
