  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas week) \u2014 elevated holiday demand risk but historical shown spikes already (P42=305, P43=157) then return to ~50 (P44\u2013P45=51,51). Demand regime: recent two extreme spikes are not yet a sustained regime (need 3+ periods). Lead time / pipeline: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals match). Current state: on-hand=36, in-transit=363 (supplier pipeline large). Risk assessment: holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit, so carrying extra inventory reduces reward unless needed to avoid large stockouts. Forecast: baseline weekly demand ~50\u201370 with occasional spikes; given large pipeline (363) plus 36 on-hand, coverage for many weeks even if demand elevated. Order decision: do not order this period to avoid extra holding cost and because existing pipeline sufficiently covers upcoming demand and holiday uncertainty.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30, immediately after major holiday shopping (Black Friday/Cyber and pre-Christmas) \u2014 explains the large short-lived spikes in P42\u2013P43. Demand analysis: recent demands P42\u2013P46 = 305,157,51,51,43. Outside the 2-period holiday spike, demand has returned to ~50 units/week (P44\u2013P46 avg = 48.3). Lead time and pipeline: carrier lead time confirmed = 4 periods per history; in-transit = 313 (multiple shipments observed arriving with 4-period lag). Inventory assessment: on-hand 43 + in-transit 313 = 356 total supply. Coverage requirement: with L=4 need to cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand; expected demand ~50/wk => need ~250 units. Risk: holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit, so excess inventory is costly. Decision logic: no new orders required \u2014 current pipeline already exceeds 5-week coverage by ~106 units; avoid ordering to reduce holding cost while maintaining service level.",
