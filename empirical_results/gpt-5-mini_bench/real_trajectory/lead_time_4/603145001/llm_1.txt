  "rationale": "Date=2019-12-30 (holiday season). Historical lead time confirmed = 4 periods (carry-over). Recent demand: P41\u2013P46 = [11,21,9,7,76,97] \u2014 two-period spike in P45\u2013P46 likely holiday-driven but not yet a sustained regime change. Longer recent low-season regime (Periods 25\u201344) averaged ~20\u201330 units. With confirmed L=4, decision must cover (L+1)=5 future periods. I use a conservative blended demand forecast \u224830 units/period (balances recent holiday spike and prevailing low-season demand) => 5-period requirement \u2248150 units. Current coverage = on-hand 0 + in-transit 100 = 100, so place order for remaining \u224850 units. Ordering 50 will bring pipeline close to 5-period cover when it arrives (subject to confirmed arrivals). No evidence (>=3 periods) of a sustained demand regime change, so no carry-over update.",
