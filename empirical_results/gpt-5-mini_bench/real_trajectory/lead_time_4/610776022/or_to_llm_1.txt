Compute stats: mean \u03bc\u0304=176.4, sample sd \u03c3\u0304\u224881.8. OR uses (1+L)=5 horizon: \u03bc\u0302=5\xd7176.4=882, \u03c3\u0302=\u221a5\xd781.8\u2248183.

Lead-time inference: no concluded arrivals yet (Period1 start), so cannot contradict promised L=4; assume promised lead time until evidence. Inventory/demand judgement: recent demand shows a sustained increase starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 weeks avg=232.3 vs prior 2-week avg=92.5), indicating higher demand regime. However, holding cost equals profit (high carrying penalty), so over-ordering beyond OR's capped recommendation risks large holding-cost drain. Strategy: accept OR's capped recommendation (311 units). It already balances 95% single-period service with the lower safety target implied by q=0.5 and prevents the large pipeline order (882) that would incur heavy holding costs. Monitor concluded arrivals and early periods for lead-time or lost-shipment signals and adjust if arrivals confirm higher sustained demand or lead-time deviation.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Promised L=4. Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for the order placed in P1; that does NOT prove loss (arrival would be observed at P1+L conclude = P5 conclude). However the pipeline shows 311 in-transit and on-hand=0. Demand outlook: carry-over insight already records a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21. Using the recent 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 average demand \u2248232.3 units/week, the (L+1)=5 period demand forecast = 5\xd7232.3 \u2248 1,161 units. To cover 5 periods at that mean we'd need \u22481,161 units; current pipeline+on-hand = 311, leaving a shortfall \u2248850 units. OR recommended 327 units (uses promised L and historical samples); that would leave total supply \u2248638, well below the 5-period demand and risks lost sales if the in-transit shipment fails. Tradeoff: profit=$1 and holding=$1 per unit-period imply critical fractile q=0.5 and no safety stock in OR's idealized model, but given confirmed higher-demand regime and the risk of lost/delayed shipments, I will partially hedge by adding to OR\u2019s recommendation rather than fully matching the 5-period cover (to limit holding cost exposure). Final action: order 500 units. This raises total supply to 311+500=811, covering \u22483.5 expected periods of demand (811/232.3 \u22483.49). This reduces stockout risk if the in-transit 311 arrives or if some portion is lost, while avoiding the heavy holding-cost exposure of ordering the full 850+ needed for 5-period coverage.

OR recommended 263 based on promised L and historical demand. Strategy: I will not place an order this period (order=0). Rationale: with substantial pipeline (811) already en route and no confirmed lost shipments, adding inventory now risks high holding cost (holding cost = profit so critical fractile = 0.5 \u2192 limited safety stock justified).

OR recommended 302 (uses promised L=4 and historical averages), but that understates recent realized demand. Policy decision: aim to better cover the (L+1)=5 period exposure while avoiding excessive extra holding given holding cost equals profit. A conservative uplift to OR is warranted to reduce stockout risk given three high-demand weeks. Calculation: expected 5-period demand \u22485\xd7299\u22481495; current pipeline 811 leaves a shortfall \u2248684. Rather than ordering full shortfall (which risks excess if some in-transit arrive sooner or some are lost), I increase OR's 302 to 400 units to partially close the gap while limiting holding cost and the risk of over-ordering against uncertain arrivals and lead-time.
