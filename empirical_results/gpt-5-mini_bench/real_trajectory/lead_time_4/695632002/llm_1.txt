Historical demand (weekly samples provided): 162, 139, 126, 85, 138 \u2192 mean \u2248130 units/week; some short dip (85) but otherwise stable around ~130. Lead time & pipeline: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals exist yet, and In-transit = 0, so treat promised LT=4 as operative until contradicted by future conclude messages. Decision rule (per instructions): ensure order + on-hand + in-transit covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand because current period demand occurs after decision and lead time is 4. On-hand + in-transit = 0, so target coverage = 5 * forecast_mean \u2248 5 * 130 = 650 units. Holding cost is high (Holding=$1/unit/period equals profit), so avoid overstocking beyond the (L+1)-period cover; maintain minimal safety since no evidence of sustained regime change.

Thus during Period 34 demand resolution we will effectively have ~80 units arriving (but this arrival happens after our decision and will satisfy Period 34 demand).
