Carry-over recorded a sustained higher regime from Periods 30\u201334 (avg ~179.4). OR recommends 211 using promised L and historical data; OR tends to cap orders and uses no recency weighting.

Demand evidence: recent periods show high variability (periods 39\u201346 demands: 135,166,164,862,227,131,157,83) with a large one-off spike (P42=862) likely seasonal/promotional; more typical recent weekly demand \u2248100\u2013200.

Cost trade-off: profit =$1 and holding cost =$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.5 implies no safety stock premium; holding cost equal to profit makes excess inventory costly.
