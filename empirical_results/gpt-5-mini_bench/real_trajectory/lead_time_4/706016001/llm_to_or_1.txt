Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time; promised L=4 used. Historical weekly demand shows a mild upward trend across 5 samples (694\u2192774); use recent_N=5 to capture current level for (1+L)-period demand. sigma left as default to use full-sample volatility. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=808 (ordered Period 1) but arrival not yet concluded -> no confirmed lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show a stable level (~689 mean). Given lack of concluded arrivals and no sustained demand regime shift, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample demand estimate) with holding cost conservatively until we see confirmed arrivals or sustained demand changes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=1601 (matches orders 808+793). Two concluded periods show zero arrivals but do not provide lead-time observations (no arrived records tied to order dates), so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments yet. Demand history (samples provided) yields a stable weekly mean ~689. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting conclusive arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=2383 (orders placed P1=808, P2=793, P3=782). No arrivals recorded in any conclude messages so far (Periods 1\u20133 conclude show arrived=0), so shipments are delayed but actual lead time is not yet observable. I choose L=default to retain the promised lead time (avoid overreacting until a conclude proves a different lead time). Demand history (five weekly samples: 694,576,685,715,774) is used via defaults: mu_hat=default uses (1+L)*mean of all samples to capture the review+lead demand; sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to reflect observed volatility. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost while remaining conservative about lead-time changes given only delayed-but-unconfirmed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (total 2383 units) remain in-transit with arrived=0 at Period 3 conclude \u2014 3 consecutive periods of no arrivals for these shipments, suggesting sustained delivery delays (possible lead time >= promised or risk of lost shipments).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded periods show no visible arrivals yet, but given promised lead time = 4, orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 would only become visible after Periods 5\u20136 concludes; current lack of conclude arrivals is not yet definitive evidence of extended lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=3173 covers multiple weeks of historical weekly demand (historical samples mean \u2248 688). To avoid overfitting to incomplete arrival information, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level against holding cost while we await conclusive arrival evidence in future conclude messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8552.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent conclude shows Period1 order arrived in Period5 => observed lead_time=4, matching promised lead time; prior multi-period no-arrival was consistent with L=4 rather than loss. On-hand=340, in-transit=2773; pipeline + on-hand covers several weeks of demand so I keep a conservative forecast. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to capture confirmed evidence (calculate -> 4). Use default demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because historical weekly samples (694,576,685,715,774; mean\u2248688.8) are reliable and no sustained demand regime change detected. These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost while reflecting the confirmed lead time and available pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). On-hand=631, in-transit=2394 (pipeline ample vs. expected demand). I choose L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirms 4). Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical samples given no sustained demand regime change. This balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4 and sizable pipeline) against holding cost by letting OR engine set base-stock using profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Current inventory: on-hand=902, in-transit=2061. Historical concludes show orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7 with observed lead_time=4 periods each \u2014 consistent evidence to use the observed average lead time. Select L via calculate to lock in actual observed LT=4. Demand history (samples provided) used with default demand aggregation: mu_hat default => (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture the 5-period demand window; sigma_hat default => sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) for volatility. These choices align the backend base-stock calculation to the confirmed 4-period lead time while keeping standard statistical demand estimates to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concludes show four consecutive orders (P1\u2013P4) arriving after 4 periods, confirming actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=1132 and in-transit=1735 (pipeline covers ~3.3 weeks of typical weekly demand); demand history (weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) has mean=688.8. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a stable base-stock anchored to historical mean while the confirmed lead time reduces under-ordering risk. This balances service level (profit/hc ratio high \u2192 higher fill target) versus holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has softened after a spring peak: last 5 period demands = [502,511,560,335,269], current on-hand=1350, in-transit=1748. Lead-time observations are consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show 4). To be responsive to the recent downward shift, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to capture the recent regime. Sigma also based on the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock tied to current realized lead time and a recent-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while preserving service given large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent on-hand=1663 + in-transit=1293 = 2956 units. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5\u201312) averages \u2248405.6 units/week, so (1+L)=5 \u2192 2028 units demand over review+lead; current pipeline comfortably covers this. Historical long-run samples (Jan weeks) show higher mean but recent regime has lower demand; lead time has been observed as 4 periods consistently. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period lead time), and I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts/volatility to the most recent 8 demand observations (periods 5\u201312). This balances service (using recent lower demand) while avoiding excess holding by not relying solely on older high-season samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent conclude history shows consistent arrivals with observed lead_time=4 for many past orders and on-hand=1950, in-transit=765. Pipeline + on-hand (2715) comfortably covers several weeks of historical weekly demand (~689 mean). Given confirmed lead time=4 in concludes, use lead-time estimate from observed data (calculate). Use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to anchor forecasts to full sample history (no recent demand regime shift detected). These choices keep the OR base-stock stable given strong on-hand, limit extra ordering while preserving service with promised lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=2068, in-transit=943. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P5 through P8\u2192P12). Pipeline contains recent arrivals on schedule; no new prolonged losses. Use promised/default lead time and demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock from long-run samples. Default mu/sigma will smooth across available historical samples and avoid overreacting to recent fluctuations, balancing service level (profit$19 vs holding$1) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=1693, in-transit=1087. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5..P8\u2192P12 observations). Recent single-period zero arrival (Period 15) is not evidence against confirmed LT=4. To balance service vs holding cost I use the backend defaults: keep promised/confirmed lead time, and use full-sample demand mean and std (default mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine leverages all historical demand data and the capped ordering rule to limit overshoot.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple observed arrivals with W=4). On-hand=1618, in-transit=964 \u2014 ample coverage but demand in recent 5 periods has been volatile and higher than the early-sample mean (recent demands: 339,241,189,375,533; mean \u2248335). To reflect confirmed LT=4 I request lead-time be inferred from observations, and to focus mu_hat on the most recent regime I use the last 5 demand samples (captures recent higher/volatile demand) while keeping sigma_hat from full-sample variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts with L+1 periods coverage) against holding cost by increasing forecast to recent demand levels while retaining conservative volatility from all data.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=1167, in-transit=964. Historical conclues show a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5..P8\u2192P12 observations). Demand regime shifted down from Jan (~690/wk) to recent weeks (~400-560/wk); to capture the recent lower demand I use a recent-N forecast. Set L via calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time from concludes. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 samples, which balances service level against holding cost given confirmed L=4 and lower recent demand.

Demand history sample mean (provided) ~688.8/wk; with promised/observed L=4 I use baseline (default) forecasting: set L to promised (4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent conclude history shows consistent 4-period arrivals for many orders (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ..., P8\u2192P12, and later confirms), so actual lead time is stable at 4. On-hand=693, in-transit=1881; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers upcoming demand but some past gaps occurred and some orders briefly showed arrived=0 before later concluding. I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period pattern). For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical weekly samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend uses the full-sample demand estimate and service-level/q tradeoff; this is conservative given confirmed lead time and avoids overreacting to short blips. These settings balance service (profit $19 vs hold $1) while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock from short-term noise.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead times (many P\u2192P+4 confirmations) and on-hand=881, in-transit=1693. Pipeline + on-hand covers multiple weeks of demand; no new sustained demand regime detected. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers the observed average lead time (effectively 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a neutral forecast that balances service level and holding cost given stable demand and confirmed lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=828, in-transit=1858. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. To match observed lead time and recent demand pattern I set L explicit=4. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 demand observations (captures current summer demand regime and recent lower weekly sales vs. early-year levels). This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost by sizing forecast and safety stock to recent demand rather than full-year mean.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=1282, in-transit=1106 (total pipeline=2388). Historical weekly mean demand ~689 (samples provided), so (1+L)=5 weeks demand \u22483445 \u2014 pipeline+on-hand is below the 5-week expected requirement, so maintain conservative forecasting using the promised/confirmed lead time and population-level demand stats. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base_stock based on all samples and L=promised (4), allowing its capped order to balance service level vs. holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

I select L=default to keep promised lead time (4) which matches observed confirmations. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples; this is appropriate because there is no clear sustained demand change and current inventory+pipeline comfortably covers several weeks of demand, balancing service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time; several earlier shipments experienced temporary delays but subsequent concludes confirm L=4. Demand history seed (Jan 2019 samples) yields weekly mean \u2248688.8. Given stable confirmed lead time and no strong recent sustained demand regime change, use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand stats. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon while letting the OR engine cap orders to control risk from in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=419, in-transit=1652. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; use promised/default lead time to align with backend. Recent demand has moderate variance with a recent uptick (last 5 demands: 381,493,432,396,740) so I set demand forecast from the most recent 5 samples to capture the current regime. I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. Profit/holding implies a target service quantile q=19/(19+1)=0.95, so the backend will compute a high base-stock; using recent data avoids over/under-stocking if demand regime shifted. This balances service level vs holding cost given high profit relative to holding cost and current healthy pipeline.

Use default lead time (promised 4) so OR backend uses full observed lead-time assumption. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to leverage full sample set (1+L=5 multiplier) and let the backend compute safety stock balancing profit($19) vs holding($1).

P8\u2192P12); no new evidence of a lead-time change. Recent demand has risen (late Aug\u2013Sep spikes, last 8 concluded demands avg \u2248706.5/week), so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the higher recent regime while keeping lead time at the promised/confirmed level. Using recent_N for sigma captures recent volatility. These parameters instruct the OR engine to size base-stock to the recent higher demand (improving service) while letting sigma reflect recent variability to limit excess holding.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has risen and is volatile (last 5 demands: 708, 707, 1428, 748, 606). On-hand=125, in-transit=3439 \u2192 pipeline total=3564 which covers ~5 periods at older mean but may be short vs recent demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. I choose L by default (promised=4). To capture the recent higher mean and volatility, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the recent regime including the 1428 spike) and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect elevated variability. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given confirmed 4-period lead time while sigma_hat recent_N informs safety stock to balance holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=277, in-transit=4094. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with 4-period lag (many confirmed P1\u2192P5 ... P8\u2192P12 and repeated confirmations through Period 36). No new sustained change in demand mean/variance (recent demand volatile but no 3+ period regime shift). In-transit + on-hand comfortably cover (1+L) periods with L=4. To keep OR backend calibrated to promised behavior and avoid overfitting to short-term volatility, I select default lead time and default demand moments so the engine uses its full-sample estimates.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Demand history shows stable weekly demand pattern from provided samples and concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 in past periods. Current on-hand=332 and in-transit=3396 (total pipeline+on-hand=3728) comfortably covers a 5-period demand forecast using historical mean. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (4) since concluded messages confirm it; mu_hat=same-period default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for a stable baseline; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the OR backend anchored to historical demand while avoiding overreacting to transient noise; current pipeline is sufficient so no aggressive inflation of forecasts is needed.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows consistent observed lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P1\u2192P5 ... P8\u2192P12). On-hand = 435, in-transit = 2630; pipeline + on-hand heavily stocked vs baseline weekly demand samples (mean=688.8). To keep the OR backend aligned with confirmed logistics and historical demand, use default lead time and demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves the backend's statistical base-stock calculation while reflecting the sustained L=4 evidence and avoids overreacting to transient fluctuations, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirmations through Period 13 and onward) and no new sustained disruptions. Pipeline + on-hand currently healthy vs recent weekly demands. I choose to infer L from observed lead times to confirm the operational reality, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies the (1+L) scaling to the long-run sample mean and std.

Inventory + pipeline comfortably covers several weeks of demand; profit/holding (19/1) implies a high target service level. I therefore use default/passthrough estimators so the OR backend (which knows historical demand samples and promised L=4) computes base_stock and caps appropriately: L uses promised lead time, mu_hat and sigma_hat use full-sample defaults to reflect long-run demand estimates and let the backend balance high service vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a persistent actual lead time = 4 in many concluded deliveries, but the last two concludes (Periods 41\u201342) showed arrived=0 while in-transit=1900 \u2014 flagging possible delayed arrivals or partial/lost shipments. Demand had an isolated large spike in Period 42 (3100) consistent with a seasonal/promo event (Black Friday week) but not yet a sustained regime shift. On-hand=0 + in-transit=1900; using the promised lead time keeps alignment with observed long-run behavior (L=4) and avoids overreacting to a single spike or temporary delivery gaps. I therefore use default methods so the OR backend computes base stock from the full-sample mean and variance, which balances service level against holding cost given the historical demand series and confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=2875. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving after 4 periods (multiple confirmations P1\u2192P5 through P8\u2192P12 and later periods), so actual lead time aligns with the promised 4 periods. Recent large demand spike in Period 42 (3100) appears isolated; overall demand history is stable around several hundred/week. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and use full-sample demand statistics (robust to intermittent spikes) I select default methods: use promised lead time=4, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (uses full-history mean) against holding cost and avoids overreacting to a single extreme week while the pipeline (2875) partly covers upcoming demand.

Demand recently elevated (Periods 40-44 show high weekly demand vs. long-run mean), so I use a short recent window to capture the current high-demand regime. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (4) confirmed historically; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service during the current high-demand window while sigma_hat ensures safety stock accounts for observed variability, balancing profit-driven service level (q\u22480.95) against holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has been volatile with several high spikes (e.g. Period 42 demand=3100) but overall historical replenishment/arrival pattern matches promised L=4. I therefore keep L at default (promised=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the long history while letting the backend cap orders to avoid excess ordering given the large existing pipeline.
