  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas). Product is women's skinny denim\u2014seasonally steady, but Black Friday/Cyber/holiday can spike demand (observed P42=3100 on 2019-11-25). Historical regime: P30\u2013P35 had elevated demand (~823/week) noted earlier. Recent weekly demand (P43\u2013P46) = 674, 680, 657, 475 (avg \u2248 622). Lead time: confirmed at 4 periods from concluded history (multiple confirmed arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=345, in-transit=3200 => total supply available \u2248 3545. Required coverage target = forecast_demand*(L+1). Using conservative forecast 700/week (upper recent obs) => 5-week cover = 3500 units. Current supply (3545) already meets/exceeds this target. Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs. profit ($19), avoid overstocking. No evidence of lost orders. Decision: place no new order this period.",
