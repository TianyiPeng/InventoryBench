Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to contradict promised lead time. Forecast & coverage target: require coverage for (L+1)=5 periods (current period demand occurs after decision), so target inventory = 5 * 134 = 670 units. Order decision: place order to bring pipeline + on-hand to target = 670 units (no in-transit to offset). Balance: equal profit and holding cost ($1/unit profit, $1/unit/period holding) argues against large excess; using demand average is conservative until we observe lead-time deviations or demand shifts.",
