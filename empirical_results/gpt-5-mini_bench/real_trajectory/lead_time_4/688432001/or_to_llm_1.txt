Recent periods 5-7 show a sustained drop (~\u221221.6%) to ~99.7/wk; P8 had a 159 spike but not yet a sustained reversal. Recent 4-period average (P5\u2013P8) =114.5/wk, implying 5-period demand \u2248572\u2013636 (depending on baseline vs. recent). 4) OR baseline: OR recommends 161 units (capped base-stock) using promised L and older mean. Following OR (161) would raise total available to 580, which provides strong service but increases holding cost given evidence of lower recent demand. 5) Decision rule applied: because lead time is confirmed at 4 and recent demand appears materially lower (~20% down), I scale OR down moderately to avoid excess holding cost while still protecting service over L+1 periods. 6) Final action: order 130 units for 688432001.

Pipeline (181) falls short by ~109 units IF weekly demand stays at 58, but recent weeks show high volatility (one large spike 140 in Period 42) that appears event-driven. Ordering more now (OR's 144) would raise inventory to ~325 units and substantially increase holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period and profit margin modest. Given sizeable pipeline (128 in transit) and evidence demand has been lower long-term, I avoid additional ordering this period to reduce holding cost risk while monitoring arrivals and demand next periods.

Current on-hand = 16; in-transit = 128 (this corresponds to the Period 43 order and will arrive after decision in the next few periods, consistent with L=4). Demand assessment: recent five-week demand (P41\u2013P45) = [22,140,86,18,37], mean = 60.6; longer-run carry-over insights show sustained downward shifts earlier in the year (most recent stable regime is lower than the initial historical mean). Risk balance: profit = $4, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8 (OR uses this and promised L). OR suggests 143 units, but that uses older demand and promised L only. Given confirmed lead time = 4, significant in-transit stock (128) arriving soon, recent lower demand with a noisy spike (P42=140) and relatively high holding cost, I reduce OR's order to avoid excess ending inventory. Calculation: expected 5-period demand \u2248 303 (using recent mean 60.6\xd75) but this recent mean is inflated by a one-off spike; adjusting downward for sustained downward regime and to limit holding cost, I target a conservative top-up to supplement the 128 in-transit: desired incremental receipt \u2248 100 units (provides additional coverage without dangerously increasing holdings).
