Variation moderate (weekly values range 98\u2013155). No sustained upward or downward shift visible. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals in history to infer actual lead time or lost orders; cannot confirm a different lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 future weeks of demand from new order. e) Order logic: Forecast 5-week demand = 127.2 * 5 = 636 units. To protect against variability and a small Valentine uplift, add ~10% buffer \u2192 target \u2248 700 units. Place order now so stock arrives in time given 4-period lead time. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit $4/unit and holding $1/unit/period.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 \u2014 end-of-year/holiday lull just passed; historical early-Jan weeks (periods at start of dataset) show higher demand (~120\u2013155) but recent Dec weeks show lower demand and one large Black Friday spike (period 42 demand=140). Demand regime: recent 5-week avg (P42\u2013P46) \u224859/wk; last several Dec weeks are low (18,37,13) except the Nov spike. Lead time & pipeline: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand 72 + in-transit 280 = 352 units in pipeline. Planning horizon must cover L+1 = 5 weeks. Using conservative forecast ~60/wk \u2192 5-week need \u2248300 units. Inventory assessment: on-hand+in-transit (352) comfortably exceeds 5-week demand; ordering risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit is $4/unit. No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time shift. Final order logic: place no order this period to avoid additional holding costs while pipeline already sufficient to cover expected near-term demand and potential early-Jan uptick.",
