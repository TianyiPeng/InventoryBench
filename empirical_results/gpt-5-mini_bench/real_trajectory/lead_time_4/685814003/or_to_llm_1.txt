Guidance requires ensuring order + on-hand + in-transit covers (L+1) periods of demand; with only 125 in pipeline we would be severely understocked (covers ~1.6 periods of expected demand). The Period 1 order shows in-transit=125 but no concluded arrivals yet, so we cannot assume earlier-than-promised lead time or that shipment is lost. Because profit equals holding cost, the critical-fractile is 0.5 and the optimal policy is to restore expected demand over lead+review (base stock). Therefore I override OR's capped recommendation and order the uncapped quantity of 265 units to bring pipeline + order up to the target base stock of 390 units, covering expected demand for the next 5 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple P orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Inventory: on-hand=548, in-transit=129 \u2192 pipeline total=677. Decision timing: orders placed now would arrive in P51 (4 periods later) and only be visible in P52, so we must cover (L+1)=5 future periods with current pipeline. Demand outlook: recent regime shifts show elevated demand since Period 39 (avg ~185 in P39\u201341) but weekly demands since P42 have been volatile (404,73,129,137,111); using a conservative high-case of ~185/week, 5-week demand \u2248925 \u2014 but that extreme average was short-lived and not yet sustained beyond 3 periods. Given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), there is no benefit to speculative inventory: excess inventory directly erodes reward. OR recommended 0 units; given confirmed lead time, large current on-hand, and high holding cost, I will follow OR and order 0 now to avoid unnecessary holding cost while existing pipeline covers near-term demand. Monitor arrivals and sales next periods for any sustained demand increase before ordering.",
