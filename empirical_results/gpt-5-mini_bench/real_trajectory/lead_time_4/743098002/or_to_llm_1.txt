OR base-stock math (using its parameters) implies a large target but its cap limits new order to ~58, producing undercoverage versus expected 5-period demand. Decision rule applied: ensure on-hand + in-transit + new order \u2248 (L+1)-period expected demand because current/new orders will only arrive after L periods and we must cover demand until then.

Action: place 131 units to bring pipeline+order close to expected 5-period demand. Risks and reasoning: this overrides OR's capped recommendation because OR's cap leaves us exposed to large expected demand over the lead-time window; we accept additional holding cost ($1/unit/period) to avoid stockouts that lose $4 profit per unmet unit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (observed earlier). Inventory & demand: on-hand=237, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been volatile: P43-46 demands = [10,12,73,70]; the large spikes in mid-Dec are likely short-term holiday surge rather than a new higher long-run regime (no sustained >3\u20135 period increase beyond earlier summer surge which was already recorded). OR recommends 87 using promised L and historical averages; that recommendation assumes additional pipeline is needed to cover 5-period demand. Given (a) confirmed LT=4 so any order placed now will arrive after the New Year, (b) current on-hand 237 already provides substantial coverage for near-term demand and would incur holding cost $1/unit/period if we overstock, and (c) recent high demand may be transitory (holiday), I will not add inventory now to avoid excess holding cost and risk of overshoot. Action: order 0 units for 743098002.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Declined OR's 87 units because on-hand 237 already provides ample coverage and confirmed 4-period lead time means new stock arrives after holiday demand peak; avoid extra holding cost on likely transient surge.",
