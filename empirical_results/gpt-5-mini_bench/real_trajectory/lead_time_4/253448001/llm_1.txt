Lingerie/push-up bras typically see a short-term uplift around Valentine's Day, so near-term demand may be elevated. Historical demand (weekly samples): 51, 39, 58, 70, 62 -> mean = 56 units/week. Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet so treat actual lead time as unknown but plan for the promised 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so current-period demand cannot be met by a new order unless lead time = 0 (no evidence). Inventory policy: cover (L+1)=5 weeks of expected demand to protect service level against the 4-period pipeline. Using base demand (conservative vs. an uncertain short Valentine spike) = 56 units/week -> target = 5 * 56 = 280 units. Tradeoff: holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit $4/unit, so this quantity balances service vs. holding risk given lack of lead-time evidence and no in-transit stock. Order 280 units now to replenish pipeline; any confirmed lead-time or demand regime shifts will be updated when conclude messages arrive.",

Demand analysis: recent weeks show elevated demand: P42-46 = [58,20,45,65,71], recent average \u224852/wk; latest two weeks (65,71) suggest a short spike but not a sustained new regime. Lead time & pipeline: carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=217 (matches orders P43=177 + P45=40). Decision rule: cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Forecast 5-period demand \u22485\xd755=275 units (using conservative uplift from recent weeks). Coverage shortfall = 275 \u2212 217 = 58 units. Order to bring pipeline up to target while limiting holding cost: place 60 units (round up slightly to avoid stockout if demand a bit higher).",
