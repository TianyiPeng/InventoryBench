Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed, so actual lead time cannot be inferred\u2014use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 91.6 units/week; with promised L=4 the review+lead period is 5 weeks, implying (1+L)*mean \u2248 458 units. Given no recent changepoint or shipment evidence, use defaults to let OR backend compute base_stock and cap from full-sample stats while avoiding overreaction to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed weekly demand samples (mean \u224891.6) from Jan\u2013Feb used as baseline; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unknown and promised lead time (4) retained. Current on-hand 0 + in-transit 109 covers ~1.19 weeks of demand (109/91.6) but arrivals not yet concluded; use default demand/uncertainty computations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service vs. holding cost conservatively given missing arrival confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=222. Two recent orders (Periods 1-2) have not concluded yet; this is concerning but below the 3+ period threshold to confirm lost shipments or a lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) have mean \u224891.6. Promised lead time remains the default (4). To avoid overreacting to only two elevated observed demands and to let the OR engine use its standard pooling over the review+lead period, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the backend uses promised L=4 and (1+L)-scaled historical mean and std.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=405 which equals sum of orders placed P1-P3 (109+113+183). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected (orders placed will only conclude at P5+). Historical weekly demand mean \u224891.6 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). No sustained changepoint or confirmed lead-time shift (need concluded arrivals to infer). Use default promised lead time and default demand stats so backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=644. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~91.6 units/week. No concluded arrivals exist to contradict the promised lead time (4), so keep promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples. This keeps policy anchored to historical baseline while avoiding premature adjustments for shipments that may still be in-transit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized customer demand (Periods 1-5) shows a sustained, large upward shift vs. historical sample mean. Observed concluded arrivals: Period 5 confirms an actual lead time of 4 for the Period 1 order, so no evidence to change promised lead time. To respond to the sustained higher demand (5 periods: 106,207,260,254,278; avg=221) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new regime while keeping L=default so the OR backend uses the promised lead time. This raises the base-stock and safety stock to improve service while acknowledging some in-transit inventory (605) and potential lost shipments; using recent statistics helps the capped-order cap remain calibrated to current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical sample mean=91.6 (5 samples) -> recent 5-period avg=221 (+141%), sustained for 5 periods (Periods 1-5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift: recent 5-period average demand \u2248221 (carry-over noted). Arrival history confirms observed lead times of 4 periods (orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=4). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (consistent with observed 4). For demand, I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). For volatility, use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias the base stock upward to meet the sustained higher demand while using recent data to avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples; they also account for confirmed lead time so pipeline coverage is aligned with actual arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1-P3 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=971 which is large but arrival confirmations are lagged; maintain lead time estimate from observations. Demand has shifted up vs. historical (recent 5-period avg elevated), so forecast demand using recent 5 periods. Chosen params: L via calculate to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the new higher regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for elevated demand while letting OR cap limit exposure to holding cost given high in-transit pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded history shows large, sustained demand rise (consecutive high demands in Periods 5-8: 278,312,423,609) and observed lead times all equal 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=1152 covers part of expected pipeline but demand regime has clearly shifted upward. I set L to default promised lead time (4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 5 observed demand samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock (raising service) while keeping variability estimates responsive to recent spikes to avoid underordering given pipeline uncertainties and potential lost shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Observed a sustained, large upward demand regime vs historical baseline (recent weekly demands: 106,207,260,254,278,312,423,609,442). Actual observed lead times from concluded messages = 4 periods (consistent). On-hand=0, in-transit=1698 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals occur after L). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empirically observed 4. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=9) to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 9 periods' mean across review+lead), and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while reflecting current lead-time reality so the OR backend will size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime and account for higher variance.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Observed sustained high demand in recent periods (demands: 106,207,260,254,278,312,423,609,442,422) and large in-transit stock (1362). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently. To align the OR backend with the recent high-demand regime and measured lead time, set L via calculate (lets backend use observed lead times), set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the last 10 realized demands, and set sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility. This reduces stockouts given the clear upward regime while keeping holding cost visible to the optimizer; large in-transit inventory will be reconciled by the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: orders P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher since Period 5 (demands: 278,312,423,609,442,422,535 over Periods 5-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1331 (covers multiple upcoming periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages; use calculated L=4. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (7 most recent post-changepoint samples: Periods 5-11). These parameters prioritize meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate ordering, reducing risk of over-ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has shifted up and remained high: recent 5-period average ~221 vs historical mean 91.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=1533 (covers multiple periods given L\u22484). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirms 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5 chosen because the recent high-demand regime length=5). These parameters prioritize service (reduce stockouts) given profit=holding cost, while relying on pipeline (1533 units) to avoid excessive new orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has shifted materially higher vs. historical (recent weeks' demands ~422\u2013544); carry-over already confirmed a sustained regime change. On-hand=201 + in-transit=1555 provides ample coverage vs. expected demand, but we must set parameters to reflect the new high-demand regime and confirmed lead time. Set L=calculate to use observed lead-time data (observed = 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current elevated mean/variance and limits influence of old low-demand samples). This balances service (higher base stock for much larger demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Demand has sustained a higher regime since Period 1-5 spike detection (carry-over: recent 5-period avg ~221 vs historical 91.6). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in conclude messages. To reflect the sustained higher demand, use recent_N for demand mean and volatility over the most recent 5 periods (captures current regime while limiting noise). Keep L as default (promised 4) since observations confirm it. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to meet elevated demand while relying on observed lead time to avoid excessive pipeline adjustments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand is well above historical Jan samples: last 5 concluded weekly demands = {535,544,415,478,472}, average \u2248 488.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=2099 (large pipeline covers multiple future periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To reflect the sustained higher demand regime and recent variability, set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the last 5 weeks, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances higher service needs (avoid stockouts given strong demand) with holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded demands are elevated versus historical: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 12-16) = [544, 415, 478, 472, 382], avg \u2248 458.2/week. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in history. On-hand=240 and in-transit=1822 provide large pipeline (\u22482062 total) vs. expected weekly demand ~458; this supports using a recent-demand forecast to capture the new higher regime while keeping lead time at the promised/default. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean to the latest high-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher demand while sigma from recent data tightens safety stock to observed variability; the large existing pipeline reduces urgency to over-order.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=520, in-transit=1413 \u2014 pipeline ample vs. recent weekly demands (P13-17 = 415,478,472,382,358). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history; no new lost-shipment signal. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 5 demand observations and their volatility) so the backend base-stock and cap reflect current regime and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods and recent demand has shifted much higher vs. original samples. On-hand=773 + in-transit=1010 gives strong pipeline. Set L to default (use promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent regime; use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the OR backend on the current high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting old low-demand samples.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=732, in-transit=975 (total pipeline=1707). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical: last 5 periods demands = [472,382,358,322,305], avg \u2248 367.8/unit per period. With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 so 5-period demand \u2248 1839 units; current pipeline (1707) is slightly short (~132). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To align forecasting with the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the recent higher mean and realized volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms it.

Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher demand regime vs the 5-sample historical baseline; on-hand=863, in-transit=762 which provides substantial coverage versus forecasted (L+1)-period demand. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend aligns with supplier promise; use default demand sizing so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the full sample set (backend will apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This keeps ordering conservative given large on-hand + in-transit and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service level under confirmed LT=4.

Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained elevated mean); use recent-demand estimation to capture current run-rate. I set L=default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=17 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (long enough to be stable but limited to recent behavior).

Demand has softened over recent weeks (last 5 demands: 305,214,175,139,116) \u2014 use a recent-5 estimate to capture current lower regime. Set L to calculate to lock in observed LT=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand level and volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given high current inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand peaked then cooled; on-hand=1105, in-transit=517 so pipeline well-stocked and no urgent replenishment. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history\u2014use observed-average to confirm. Use default demand/volatility aggregation (backend uses all historical samples provided) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect (1+L) scaling with full-sample mean/std. This keeps orders conservative given high inventory and equal profit/holding ($1/$1).

No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint in the most recent concluded periods; inventory is ample so avoid aggressive forecasting tweaks. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation and cap, avoiding ad-hoc reductions that might understock if demand reverts.

Recent realized weekly demand has fallen to ~50-90 units (last 5 periods demand = 81,76,85,84,57; mean \u224876.6) while on-hand inventory is very high (1239) and in-transit is 14 (total pipeline 1253). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods historically; use promised/default lead time. To avoid overstock given heavy inventory, set demand forecast to recent behavior: use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures current low-volatility regime). This reduces ordering compared with using older high-demand samples and balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Current on-hand=1180, in-transit=14 (pipeline=1194) which is large versus recent demand. Recent demand has fallen sharply vs earlier spikes; last 6 periods (P25-30) avg demand=73.67. Promised lead time is 4 and historically confirmed as 4; keep L=default to align with supplier promise. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (we forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce orders relative to earlier high-demand regime, lowering holding costs while maintaining service for the current lower demand environment and accounting for the 4-period review+lead window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: recent 6-period avg=73.67 (Periods 25-30), sustained for 6 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=1108, in-transit=14 \u2192 ample coverage vs recent demand (~60\u201385/week). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in history; no evidence of new LT shift. Demand regime since Period 25 has been lower (recent avg ~73.7 over Periods 25\u201330/31). I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime (regime length \u22487 periods: P25\u2013P31) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices keep target base-stock small enough to avoid excess holding given high on-hand while preserving service for expected demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has fallen to a lower regime: Periods 25-32 demands = [81,76,85,84,57,59,72,62] (recent 6-period avg used = ~73.7 from Periods 25-30 per carried insight). On-hand=1046, in-transit=14 \u2014 ample coverage vs ~70/wk demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence. I select L=default to keep promised lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the lower post-changepoint regime (sustained 6 periods). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to the earlier high-demand regime, lowering holding cost while preserving service against the current lower-demand pattern.

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=934, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 25 (recent 6-period avg=73.67). I therefore keep lead time at the promised value and set demand forecast using recent data from the post-change regime to avoid overstocking. Chosen L: default (use promised 4). Chosen mu_hat: recent_N with N=9 to capture the most recent stable regime (Periods 25-33). Chosen sigma_hat: recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters reduce target base stock to match the lower-demand regime and limit additional inbound inventory given no in-transit units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has settled well below earlier high peaks; last 6 demands (Periods 30-35) = [59,72,62,126,39,35], recent mean=65.5 units/week. On-hand=860, in-transit=0 so current inventory is ample relative to recent demand; no overdue arrivals beyond the known confirmed 4-period lead time. I choose L=default to trust the confirmed promised lead time (4) used historically. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the lower recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples will scale demand across review+lead). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility including the one outlier (126) without diluting with old high-variance periods. These settings reduce ordering toward the new lower demand while keeping safety for observed variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 25 (recent 6-period avg ~73.7). On-hand=813, in-transit=0 \u2014 large on-hand stock already covers many weeks; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in history. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to forecast (1+L) demand using the most recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture recent variability. This keeps the base stock aligned to current low demand and avoids unnecessary new receipts that would increase holding cost given already high on-hand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): recent demand has been in the low 30s\u2013120s range; last 6 demands (P32\u2013P37)=62,126,39,35,47,70 (mean\u224863.17). On-hand=743, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample versus current demand, so use a recent-6 demand estimate reflecting the lower regime and keep promised lead time. Set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed lower-demand regime and recent volatility; this avoids over-ordering given high on-hand and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=685, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime (~60\u201380/week since Period 25 with recent weeks around mid-60s to 70s). Promised lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand, keep promised lead time and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime using the last 8 weeks to capture current trend. L set to default (promised=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=8 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 8 demands, reducing future order quantities and aligning service vs. holding cost tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 31-39: 72,62,126,39,35,47,70,58,61; excluding the single 126 spike the recent run centers ~60-75). On-hand=624, in-transit=0 \u2014 this comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand if L\u22484. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed concluded lead times (will return ~4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (focus on Periods 31-39), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and avoids the earlier high-demand regime. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to reflect reduced recent volatility. This configuration tells the OR backend to target safety stock for the current low-demand regime while respecting the confirmed lead time and avoiding unnecessary replenishment given ample on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=572, in-transit=0. Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 25 (recent 6-period avg\u224873.67) and lead time previously confirmed as 4. Use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the recent 6-period regime to reflect current lower sales; volatility also from the same recent 6 periods. With (1+L) coverage from recent demand, this avoids over-ordering and limits holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has settled well below earlier peak (last 6\u201317 weeks average ~60s; Period 41 demand=41). On-hand=531, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory vs current demand; no overdue arrivals. Lead time historically confirmed as 4. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime since Period 25, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (regime length ~Periods 25\u201341 \u224817). L kept as default (promised 4). This biases the OR backend toward a lower base-stock (reducing holding cost) while still sizing safety stock from recent volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a single large spike (Period 42 demand=431) on top of a long low-demand regime (~35\u2013130). Observed lead times historically equal promised 4 periods. To avoid overreacting to a one-period spike and given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> z*=0), use the promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend computes a stable base-stock: L kept as promised to match observed arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default to use all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) which balances service vs holding without overfitting the single spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (order placed Period 43). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. Recent two periods show large spikes (P42=431, P43=250) but not a sustained regime shift. To avoid overreacting to a short spike and because lead time is confirmed, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample statistics and caps. This balances service vs. holding cost given holding cost equals profit.

On-hand=0, in-transit=976 (sizable pipeline arriving per confirmed LT=4). Use promised/default lead time to keep alignment with supplier contract and historical confirmed LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this balances service vs. holding given the large in-transit volume and avoids overreacting to a brief spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand volatility with a large Dec spike (Periods 42-45 demands = 431,250,34,239) and moderate pre-spike levels (Periods 40-41 = 52,41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1035 which currently covers ~ (1+promised L) demand at elevated recent mean. Lead time historically confirmed as 4; use promised lead time to keep OR engine consistent. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the new higher-december regime while limiting dilution from older low-demand weeks: recent_N N=6 (Periods 40-45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases base-stock higher to avoid stockouts during the confirmed December spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability. Keeping L=default prevents the backend from mis-estimating arrival timing given confirmed 4-period behavior.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=1035. Historical base sample mean=91.6 (weekly). Recent 5 demands (Periods 42-46) = [431,250,34,239,117], recent mean=214.2 which indicates elevated/volatile holiday-season demand vs long-run mean. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; no strong evidence to change promised LT. Set L=default to use promised 4. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher short-run mean across the review+lead window (1+L=5). For sigma, use recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated recent volatility and ensure safety stock responds to current variability. These choices bias orders upward to cover holiday surge while letting the OR backend cap orders per its policy to limit overstock risk given holding cost = profit.
