The order of 240 placed in Period1 has not yet concluded (arrived=0 in Period2 and Period3 concludes) and currently shows as In-transit=240. No concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time >=3 and possibly equals promised 4; shipment could still arrive. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0 but in-transit=240 should cover multiple weeks if it arrives.
