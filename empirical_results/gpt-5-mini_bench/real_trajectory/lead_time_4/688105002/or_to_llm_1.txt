OR recommended 112 (based on older historical average); I reduce it because the large in-transit pipeline already covers most of the 5-period demand and profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5 (no safety stock premium). No evidence of lost shipments or new regime shifts requiring extra buffer. Final action: order 46 units to bring expected available inventory in line with 5-period demand while minimizing holding cost.",
