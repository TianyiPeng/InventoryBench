  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end). No clear holiday-driven upswing for this denim mini-skirt beyond earlier Nov/late-Nov spikes; recent weeks show modest demand. Demand analysis: recent observed demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [144*, 38, 57, 58, 38] where P42 had a stock-constrained spike and subsequent weeks average \u224846/week. Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead time confirmed as 4 periods from history; in-transit = 295 units (sufficient pipeline). Inventory impact: holding cost = $1/unit/period equals unit profit, so excess inventory directly reduces objective. Decision logic: with L=4 we need coverage for L+1=5 upcoming periods; estimated demand \u224845\u201350/week \u21d2 required coverage \u2248225\u2013250 units. In-transit 295 already exceeds that; to avoid unnecessary holding cost, place no new order this period.",
