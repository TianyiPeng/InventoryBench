Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly sales show a sustained uptick starting 2019-01-21 (125,150,153) vs prior weeks (0,24). To react to the new higher-demand regime while using promised lead time, I keep L as default (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand weeks so the OR engine raises replenishment to meet the new demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg increased from 12.0 (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) to 142.67 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=168 (order placed P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised/default lead time. Historical demand shows sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples 125,150,153). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-sample regime to reflect the higher mean and recent volatility (N=3 per regime detection rules). L left as default to avoid falsely shortening/lengthening lead time without concluded evidence. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the new higher demand while keeping sigma aligned with recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent weekly demands: 125,150,153; prior weeks much lower). On-hand=0, in-transit=352 and prior orders have not concluded yet but no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time, so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to let backend assume promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (mean of last 3 samples \u2248142.67) scaled by (1+L) in backend. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples; keeping L=default avoids prematurely assuming lost or lengthened lead times given lack of concluded arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=520 (matches orders from P1-P3); no concluded arrivals so cannot confirm actual lead time \u2014 use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) = [99,102,75]; no new sustained changepoint since prior carry-over insight. To be responsive to the most recent observed demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (captures current weekly demand average) and set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 for recent volatility. Keep L as default (promised 4) because no concluded arrivals to justify changing lead time. These choices ensure the OR backend targets inventory for the recent observed demand while not overstating lead time given missing arrival confirmations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent realized weekly demand has been high (period demands: 99, 102, 75, 82) consistent with the earlier detected regime shift starting 2019-01-21. On-hand=0, in-transit=520 (matches orders placed in P1\u2013P3), and no concluded arrivals yet so do NOT infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) so backend uses L=4. For demand I use recent_N over the last 4 observed demand periods to capture the post-shift regime (N=4 = available recent sample count). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service (given profit=holding cost so q=0.5) while avoiding premature lead-time adjustments despite outstanding in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows a confirmed lead time observation: an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4). On-hand=99, in-transit=352 (pipeline adequate vs. expected demand spike from Jan regime shift). I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times average (matches promised 4). For demand I use default mu_hat which applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples (captures the elevated regime from 2019-01-21 onward embedded in sample set). sigma_hat default uses all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults keep target base-stock aligned with measured demand/variance while acknowledging shipments now confirm promised lead time and existing pipeline stock reduces urgent ordering need.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-177.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Demand regime shift captured earlier: recent high-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) persists (samples: 125,150,153). Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). On-hand 230 + in-transit 168 provides coverage; no lost shipments detected. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (use last 3 high-demand samples). Match sigma to same recent_N=3 to reflect volatility in the current regime. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher recent mean while keeping variability estimation aligned, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=125, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20133 all arrived with lead_time=4 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed. Demand samples show a sustained upward regime beginning 2019-01-21 (recent samples: 125,150,153). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (captures the post-changepoint high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast reflects the higher recent mean and volatility. This raises target base-stock to protect service during the 4-period lead; using recent data limits overstock from older low-demand samples. No in-transit units\u2014policy should replenish to cover (L+1) periods of recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived in P5\u2013P7; observed lead_times=4).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand regime (shift noted from 2019-01-21) and confirmed lead time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=334 (these in-transit units likely correspond to recent order placed in P8). Use L estimate from observed lead-time history to match actual arrival behavior. For demand, use a recent window to capture the post-shift higher mean and current volatility: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 4\u20138) average ~120.6/week; multiply by (1+L) in backend. Use same recent window for sigma to reflect current variability including the large spike in Period 7. These choices aim to secure service (cover review+lead demand) while avoiding excessive holding cost given high holding=$1 matching profit.

Lead time observed repeatedly =4 so use observed-average for L. Use recent demand (N=5) to set mu_hat to capture the new higher regime while keeping sigma_hat default to reflect overall variability for the (1+L) horizon.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=602. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent P1\u2013P3 arrivals); promised L=4. Demand regime shift occurred starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean); recent periods (P3\u2013P10) show elevated demand. I set L to calculate (backend will confirm avg observed lead time\u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (covering the post-changepoint regime P3\u2013P10) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean over the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit=holding, equal) by sizing base stock from the confirmed higher-demand regime while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given long pipeline (602 units) and potential lost shipments evidence earlier.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (recent 5-period demands: 273,126,66,88,137; mean=138). On-hand=0, in-transit=602 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but likely short of cover for the (1+L) review+lead window given elevated demand. Lead time has been observed as 4 in concluded history; use observed-average. Set L via calculate to lock to observed lead-time behavior. For demand, use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean_recent). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the higher demand while recognizing current pipeline before ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=236, in-transit=356; pipeline plus on-hand provides coverage but recent demand has been volatile with a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21. Lead-time observations in concluded history consistently show 4 periods (orders P1\u2013P3 arrived in P5\u2013P7 and P8 arrival confirms). I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 5\u201312 demands: 69,53,273,126,66,88,137,98) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher, volatile regime rather than the older low-demand samples. This biases base-stock upward to protect service during higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N inflates safety stock for observed variability; that balances profit vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

To respect confirmed lead time I'll let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). For demand I focus on the post-shift regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (captures 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 regime). This raises forecast and variability to maintain service while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=362, in-transit=88; recent concluded history confirms actual lead time=4. Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean). To capture the post-shift demand and recent variability I use recent_N with N=8 (focus on the latest 8 demand observations) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. L set explicitly to 4 to lock in observed lead time so pipeline coverage (1+L) matches reality and avoids under-ordering despite delayed/previous lost shipments. This raises target base stock to preserve service given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=276, in-transit=220; no arrivals were concluded for recent orders so pipeline looks intact and there are no overdue/lost shipments. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21. To keep the OR backend aligned with the promised lead time and long-run sample statistics, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand moments so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (given confirmed higher mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent weeks show sustained moderate demand (most recent demands ~61\u201398 per week) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 from prior concludes. On-hand=270, in-transit=132 (pipeline=402) \u2014 ample coverage versus expected demand. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to base mu_hat on the most recent regime (captures post-shift demand pattern and avoids diluting with early low samples). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) so variability matches the recent regime. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the higher sustained demand while avoiding excess safety stock given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=216, in-transit=175 (pipeline=391) which covers ~5 periods of recent demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4; recent demand (last 5 sales: 61,81,86,94,54) averages ~75.2/week -> (1+L) demand ~376. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time and recent-5 demand/volatility for base stock sizing so the OR backend adapts to the current lower post-spike regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over recorded). On-hand=173, in-transit=175; pipeline plus on-hand is ample but lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history. I set L to default (promised lead time) to keep OR backend aligned with contract lead time. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus estimates on the recent high-demand regime (captures recent 8 demand observations after the regime shift) so base_stock reflects current higher mean and recent volatility; this balances service (profit=$1) vs holding cost ($1) by grounding forecasts in the recent regime while avoiding overreaction to single-week noise.

Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm LT=4; demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders P1\u2013P3\u2192arrivals P5\u2013P7 etc.), so use calculated lead time from observations. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained higher weekly demand through recent periods); to capture the current regime I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent high-demand behavior. With profit=holding, service target is 50% (z\u22480) so setting mu_hat from recent demand avoids understocking given a long pipeline; sigma_hat from recent demand captures current variability. No new missing-shipment signal observed beyond previously confirmed LT=4.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has persisted at a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (weekly demands frequently ~80\u2013140). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 \u2014 with promised L\u22484 this pipeline roughly covers several weeks of demand but we still need the OR to target multi-week coverage. I set L=calculate to use observed lead-times (confirmed ~4). For mu_hat I choose recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (capture current mean over recent weeks and scale by (1+L)). sigma_hat left as default to let backend use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings prioritize service (reduce stockouts given confirmed higher demand and in-transit inventory) while keeping holding cost consideration via backend cap.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Recent weekly demand has been elevated and stable over the last 10 periods (Periods 14\u201323) with mean \u224897 units/week; (1+L)=5 \u21d2 target review+lead demand \u2248485. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; pipeline (440) roughly covers ~4.5 weeks of demand but on-hand=0 so maintain coverage. I choose L=default (promised=4) because concluded history supports LT=4. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current sustained higher-demand regime (10-period mean ~97 and corresponding volatility) so the OR backend sets base-stock to meet the elevated demand while limiting overstock given high holding cost equal to profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent weeks show sustained high demand (~100\u2013140/week since 2019-01-21). On-hand=24, in-transit=350 (large pipeline arriving in future weeks). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use calculated average to reflect that. To keep the OR engine responsive to the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent demand regime using recent_N=12 (captures ~3 months of weekly demand including latest volatility). This balances service (high recent mean) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=121, in-transit=274 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4, matching promised. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent weeks remain variable but elevated. To keep service high while avoiding excess holding (profit=$1, holding=$1), I use the promised lead time (default=4) and focus forecasts on the most recent 20 periods to capture the post-changepoint regime and current volatility. recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat makes the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while capping orders via the OR engine reduces over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning 2019-01-21 and confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals consistent with L=4). On-hand=181 + in-transit=275 provides coverage vs. (1+L) demand but we still base forecasts on the post-change regime. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual = 4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to estimate (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent sustained regime (cap N at 20). These choices align the OR backend's base-stock with the higher recent demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=131, in-transit=330. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4 (matches promised). Demand regime shift occurred starting 2019-01-21 and has remained the new baseline; recent demand is best captured by recent samples. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained post-changepoint regime using the most recent 20 demand observations (captures current mean/volatility and limits older pre-shift influence). This balances service (by sizing base stock to recent higher mean) against holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand regime is the higher level that began 2019-01-21 and has persisted; no new seasonal events. On-hand=108, in-transit=288 => pipeline+on-hand=396, which covers multiple weeks of recent demand (no overdue/lost shipments visible; historical concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=4). I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history consistently shows 4 and there is no new evidence to change it. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; using 20 samples balances recency and variance estimation to align base-stock with service/holding tradeoff (profit=holding, so target z\u22480). This keeps orders conservative given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent weekly demand has been variable but centered ~60\u2013140; on-hand=173, in-transit=240 (pipeline=413) which covers multiple weeks of demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead times. I set L via calculation (use observed lead times) to reflect confirmed lead_time=4. For demand I use an EWMA (gamma=0.3) to emphasize recent weeks while retaining longer-run stability given variability. Sigma left as default to let backend scale volatility from full history. These choices keep safety stock responsive to recent demand changes while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=257, in-transit=119, promised L=4 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (no new evidence of change). Recent weekly demand has moderated vs earlier spike; last 12 concluded demands (Periods 19\u201330) average lower (~70s) and less volatile than the full history, so I bias forecast to recent data. I therefore use default lead time (promised) and recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std. This reduces excess holding while preserving service for the nearer-term demand pattern and accounts for the current healthy on-hand + in-transit buffer.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has settled to low/steady weekly sales (~37 units for the last 3 weeks) after earlier regime shifts in Q1; on-hand=282 + in-transit=124 provides ample coverage vs near-term demand. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence. To adapt to the recent low-sales regime I use a short recent window (3 weeks) to set demand estimates so OR reduces excess inventory while preserving service. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute a much smaller (1+L)-period demand forecast; L left as default (promised 4) since concluded history supports the promised lead time and there are no missing shipments now.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent demand has settled well below the early 2019 spike (recent weeks ~30\u201370 units). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use promised lead time. To make the forecast responsive to the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent demand regime (captures current mean); set sigma_hat likewise to reflect recent volatility. On-hand (253) + in-transit (121) is ample vs. short-term demand, so no explicit upward correction for lost shipments is needed.

Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4. To capture the recent demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with promise, I set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 9 weeks shown above; (1+L) scaling is handled by backend). This balances service (using recent lower mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding so we avoid excess stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Current on-hand=170, in-transit=67. Historic data shows a sustained demand regime shift in early 2019 and lead time previously confirmed at 4 periods; recent weeks exhibit lower stabilized weekly demand (~30-90 range). No evidence of new demand or lead-time changepoints in the last several periods. To be conservative and consistent with confirmed promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This balances service (using full-sample stats after the confirmed regime) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=183, in-transit=167. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Demand since mid-year has settled well below the initial Jan spike; recent weekly demand (last ~8 concluded periods) averages roughly 50\u201360 units with moderate volatility. Pipeline + on-hand currently provides strong coverage, but to avoid overstock while maintaining service with promised L=4, I use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the lower recent regime. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time = 4; mu_hat=recent_N to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward current lower-demand reality, reducing holding cost while preserving service level given observed lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been much lower and stable versus the early 2019 spike; current on-hand=136 and in-transit=167 (total pipeline=303) which comfortably covers several weeks of demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I therefore set L using calculated observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the latest (lower) regime: this reduces \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 relative to the early high-demand regime and prevents over-ordering given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has settled lower (~30\u201360 range) compared to the early 2019 spike; on-hand=81, in-transit=167 (coverage ~4 periods). Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms LT=4 and arrivals are regular. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent stable demand regime (last 8 weeks) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to match current lower-demand regime while limiting extra holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods (carry-over). Current on-hand=10 + in-transit=169 provides coverage vs. upcoming demand but some arrivals may still be in-transit; no recent lost-shipment signals. Recent demand has settled below the high early-2019 spike; last 8 demand samples show a moderate sustained level (~30\u201390, recent weeks ~47\u201371). To reflect the recent regime (more stable, lower than initial spike) I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime, letting the OR backend compute (1+L)-period demand mean and scaled std. This balances service (using recent demand to avoid overstock from earlier spike) against holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=125, in-transit=87. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a persistent higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21. No recent evidence of lost shipments or new changepoints; inventory is healthy (on-hand + in-transit covers several weeks of demand). I therefore use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the long-run observed regime while the OR engine's cap limits order size to control holding cost given profit=holding (service quantile ~0.5). No explicit adjustments needed for missing shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=90, in-transit=248 (total pipeline=338). Promised lead time=4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4; keep default LT to align with backend. Recent weekly demand has been ~30\u201370 units; to capture the current regime (post-Jan shift and recent stability) use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the last 10 weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts given 5-period coverage) against high holding cost (equal to profit) by using recent demand stats rather than long-run averages.

I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance over (1+L) periods\u2014this balances service level (covering current + L periods) against holding cost given profit=holding cost. Defaults also avoid overreacting to short-term noise while existing pipeline (248) plus on-hand provides coverage.

Recent demand has settled below the early-2019 spike; last months show moderate weekly demand with occasional spikes (e.g., P42=144). To keep the OR backend responsive to the recent regime while letting it account for the 5-period review+lead window, I use recent_N=12 for both demand mean and volatility (captures ~3 months of recent behavior) and default lead time (promised 4, consistent with observed concludes). This balances service (use recent demand evidence) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly demand mostly in the 30\u201360 range; historical regime shift in Jan 2019 noted earlier but no new sustained demand or lead-time changes. Inventory on-hand=47, in-transit=265 (total pipeline 312) \u2014 sufficient to cover multiple weeks given recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid over-ordering with large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics; this balances service level vs holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent demand has been moderate (~30\u201360/week) with one large spike (144 on 2019-11-25) likely an outlier. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=151 and in-transit=203 (total 354) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at recent demand levels, so no explicit upward correction to L is needed. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the recent lower-volatility regime while diluting the single spike; this adapts the base-stock to current demand and keeps inventory/holding cost balanced against service. No evidence of new sustained regime or lost shipments since last insights.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=93, in-transit=203 (pipeline=296). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Given elevated pipeline and recent weekly demand variability (including a one-time large demand of 144 in P42) I target recent demand to set forecast and volatility so the OR backend reacts to the most recent regime. Set L to promised (4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 7 weeks of demand and recent holiday volatility while avoiding overweighting older winter/early-year regimes. This balances service (capture recent spike risk) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=159, in-transit=101 (total pipeline=260). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand (last 12 concluded weeks P35\u2013P46) averages ~56.8/week => (1+L)=5 implies 5-period demand \u2248285. Pipeline (260) is slightly below that forecast, so I choose a recent-window forecast to capture the current lower, stable regime and keep service without excessive holding. L kept as promised (default) since observed lead time =4 is confirmed; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to reflect the most recent demand regime (N=12) and reduce overweighting of early high-Jan spike. This raises replenishment targets modestly to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost given profit=holding cost.
