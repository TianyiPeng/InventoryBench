The SKU is a women's necklace, which is Valentine-relevant and likely to see a short-term spike around this date. b) Demand analysis: historical weekly samples for this SKU (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show values [33,32,51,28,20], mean \u2248 33 units/week with a one high week (51) and recent dip to 20. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals in history to contradict this; in-transit=0 and no evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=0 so current-period demand will go unmet. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 5 (decision now is Period 1; arrival during Period 5), so we must plan for demand covering L+1 = 5 upcoming periods. e) Order logic: Use historical mean \u224833 units/week as baseline and plan to cover 5 periods => 33\xd75 \u2248165 units. Although holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period) which penalizes excess inventory, we lack pipeline and must stock to capture demand after the lead time. Given the Valentine spike occurs within the next few days and cannot be served by new arrivals (lead time 4), I place an order to cover expected demand over the next 5 periods (165 units) to avoid prolonged stockouts once shipments arrive. Monitor arrivals/concludes to update lead time and adjust future orders.",

Demand analysis: recent 8-week demand has declined (P37\u2013P44 = 89,77,65,54,68,63,26,17) with a 8-week average \u224857/week and most recent 4-week average \u224834/week (P41\u2013P44 = 68,63,26,17 -> avg 41.0, but last two weeks are very low). Lead time & pipeline: historical CONCLUDE messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed Pn arrive at Pn+4). Current stock: on-hand=137, in-transit=170 \u2192 total available 307 units. At recent demand ~57/week this covers ~5+ weeks; even under moderate holiday uplift this pipeline provides coverage through the near term. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory is costly. Ordering now would arrive after 4 periods (too late for immediate Christmas spike) and would increase holding cost. Final decision: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost given adequate coverage and long lead time.",
