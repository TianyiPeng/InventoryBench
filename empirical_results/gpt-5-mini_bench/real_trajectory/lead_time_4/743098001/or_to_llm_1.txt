{
  "rationale": "Observed lead time confirmed = 4 (carry-over). Current on-hand = 115, in-transit = 33 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 148. Recent demand (Periods 41\u201346 = 68,63,26,17,66,53) average \u2248 48.8 units/period. With lead time L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after ordering: expected 5-period demand \u2248 48.8\xd75 = 244. Required order = max(0, 244 \u2212 pipeline 148) = 96. Holding and profit are equal ($1), so overstock beyond expected sales nets zero or negative incremental reward; therefore order exactly the shortfall to meet expected demand. OR recommended 133 (higher) but that would raise holding cost given our pipeline; I reduce to 96 to match expected 5-period demand given confirmed lead time and recent demand levels.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 133\u219296: pipeline (115+33=148) covers part of the 5-period demand (~244), so order only the 96-unit shortfall to avoid excess holding given profit=holding.",
