Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 743098001 (necklace). Historical weekly demand mean = 32.8 (samples: 33,32,51,28,20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (L+1) periods of demand. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet, so use promised lead time. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so target service quantile is 0.5; using default demand estimates provides a neutral starting base-stock. Methods chosen: default lead time (promised 4), default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Product is low-cost necklace; historical weekly samples show mean demand ~33+32+51+28+20 = 164/5 = 32.8 \u224833. Period 1 conclude shows ordered=52 arrived=0 and demand=20; on-hand=0, in-transit=52. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed\u2014could be promised 4 or delayed/lost. I use default lead time (promised L=4) because there is no sustained evidence of a different lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given modest profit=holding and available in-transit 52 that should cover several periods. No new confirmed changepoints.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded history shows no arrivals yet for orders placed in P1/P2 but that is expected with the promised lead time=4 (orders placed will arrive in P5). Demand history (weeks to 2019-02-04: 33,32,51,28,20) gives mean=32.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=102 covers several periods of demand but arrivals are not yet observable. No evidence of a lead-time or demand regime shift; use default calculations to let the OR engine apply the promised lead time and full-sample demand stats.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand samples (weekly Jan data) have mean ~32.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=148. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (52,50,46) have no concluded arrivals after three periods\u2014possible delayed or lost shipments, but no concluded lead-time evidence yet. I will use the promised lead time (default) because actual lead time cannot be confirmed from concludes. Use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost while avoiding premature manual overrides given uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (52,50,46) have not concluded after 3 periods; possible delayed/lost shipments\u2014monitor for confirmation in subsequent concludes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=148; orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 still have not concluded (possible delayed/lost shipments). To protect service while shipments remain uncertain, I extend assumed lead time slightly above promised to increase coverage of uncertain pipeline. Set L explicit=6 (conservative), keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all historical samples (mean=32.8) scaled by (1+L) to compute required base-stock and volatility. This raises target inventory to balance lost/delayed arrival risk vs. holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent conclude (Period 5) shows arrival of Period 1 order with lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. Current on-hand=42, in-transit=128 \u2192 pipeline=170 which roughly matches (1+L)*mean demand. I therefore set L via observed average ('calculate') to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this keeps orders aligned with historical demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise or prior delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent on-hand=85, in-transit=78; two past orders confirmed lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). Historical weekly samples (Jan) mean=32.8 but last 6 observed demands (P1-P6) = [20,23,16,8,10,7], recent mean=14, a sustained downward shift. Expect (1+L)=5 review+lead period. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new, lower demand regime and lower volatility, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit. This balances service vs holding by lowering target base stock to match recent demand while pipeline plus on-hand currently provides coverage for several periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent 6-period avg demand=14 vs historical avg=32.8 (\u221257%), sustained over Periods 1\u20136.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Demand regime has shifted down and been sustained across Periods 1\u20136 (recent 6-period avg ~14 vs historical ~32.8). On-hand=72, in-transit=32 -> ample immediate coverage. To match observed lead time and recent lower demand, set L by calculation from observed lead times and set demand estimates using the recent 6-period regime (captures the sustained lower mean and recent volatility). This reduces order targets vs historical averages, lowering holding costs while preserving service for current lower demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent history shows a confirmed lead time of 4 periods and a sustained demand regime drop (recent 6-period avg demand \u224814 vs historical \u224832.8). Current inventory: on-hand=22, in-transit=32. With L confirmed=4, I reduce forecast reliance on long-run historical mean and use the recent 6-period regime to set demand forecast and volatility. This keeps ordering aligned with the lower realized demand, lowering holding costs while preserving service. Chosen methods: L estimated from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=22, in-transit=64. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9). Demand has shifted: low regime P1\u2013P6 (avg\u224814) followed by higher demand in P7\u2013P9 (59,50,32). I set L by calculate to lock actual observed lead time=4. For demand I target the most recent regime (P7\u2013P9) using recent_N with N=3 so mu_hat reflects the current higher demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture current volatility. This balances avoiding stockouts given recent spike while limiting holding cost by using a short recent window rather than full-history smoothing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand P7\u2013P9 = 47 vs avg P1\u2013P6 = 14 (+236%)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: last 6 demands (P5\u2013P10) = [10,7,59,50,32,25], recent-6 mean = 30.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=134 (covers multi-period demand but some shipments recently concluded consistent with L=4). Lead time has been observed repeatedly as 4 periods (several concluded messages); use calculated L to reflect observed history. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher/volatile demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand periods. These settings keep the OR base-stock responsive to the post-changepoint demand spike while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding cost given holding/profit parity ($1/$1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=153. Past concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9). Demand regime shifted up at Period 7 (P7\u2013P9 avg \u224847 vs prior avg \u224814) and has persisted through Period 11. To reflect the confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' for L. For demand forecasting I use recent data from the post-changepoint regime (most recent 5 periods, Periods 7\u201311) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5; this keeps inventory targeted to the higher recent demand while capping orders via the OR engine to control holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand regime is the higher regime that began at Period 7 (sustained elevated demand P7\u2013P12). Actual observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=0, in-transit=194 \u2014 pipeline appears large but some earlier shipments were delayed then confirmed; use inferred L=4 (calculate) so the OR engine uses observed lead times. To reflect the post-Period-7 higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=6 periods: P7\u2013P12) so the forecast and volatility reflect current demand. This balances service (capture higher mean) vs holding cost by limiting lookback to the current regime rather than older low-demand data.

Historical concludes show actual lead_time=4 consistently since Period 5; demand regime shifted up starting Period 7 (P7\u2013P13 demand avg \u224834.6). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time (avg of observed =4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 7\u201313) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; this yields (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility that better balance service level vs holding cost given current on-hand + large pipeline. No evidence of new lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand regime is elevated and volatile since Period 7 with large spikes (Periods 13\u201314: 33,78) and current period high (47). On-hand=23, in-transit=75 (pipeline adequate but recent high demand warrants using recent data). Lead times have been observed consistently as 4 periods (confirmed in history P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9, P9\u2192P13, P10\u2192P14). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent regime (captures the spike starting Period 7 and most recent variability), balancing service-level need against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=127. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4). Recent demand has shifted upward since Period 10 (demands P10\u2013P15 = 25,28,19,33,78,156) \u2014 latest regime appears elevated and volatile. I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent 6 periods (captures current elevated regime while limiting noise). These parameters prioritize service (profit=holding, so 50% critical fractile) while using recent demand to avoid underordering given the recent surge and long lead time. Current pipeline (127) plus any order will cover part of the (1+L) demand but based on the elevated recent mean the backend will size orders to maintain service without excessive extra cap via sigma capping.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded orders). Demand has markedly increased in the most recent regime (large spikes Periods 14\u201316). I set L to calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime observed across the last 6 periods, so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility and avoid diluting with much older low-demand data. This balances service (avoid stockouts given big recent spikes) versus holding cost by using a focused recent-sample forecast rather than all-time mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (e.g., P1\u2192arrived P5). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 13 (demands P13\u2013P17 = 33,78,156,165,153). I set L to reflect observed lead time (calculate) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 periods). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the current high mean and elevated volatility while using in-transit inventory (400) to avoid excessive additional ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand P13\u2013P17 = 117.0 vs prior avg ~47 (+149%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been volatile with a confirmed high-demand regime from P13\u2013P17 (avg ~117) but P18 dropped to 38; overall recent 5-periods (P14\u2013P18) reflect this volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=570 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed evidence. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the latest regime (captures the P13+ demand surge while including the P18 dip) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the review+lead horizon under current demand regime while capping orders via its cap to limit excess inventory given high in-transit volume.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=12, in-transit=519. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders observed with lead_time=4), and demand has been elevated since Period 13 though with some variability. Pipeline (519) plus on-hand covers multiple future periods; however promised lead time remains 4 and has been confirmed. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Demand forecasting uses a recent-demand regime (Periods 13\u201319 high-volume run) so I use recent_N with N=7 to target the most recent regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat; this balances service (avoid stockouts during high recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 but volatile week-to-week (recent demands: P16\u2013P20 = 165,153,38,59,57). On-hand=99, in-transit=375 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=474. Promised lead time 4 is confirmed by past concludes; use default L to keep OR backend aligned. To capture the recent high-but-volatile regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (N=5) so the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast reflects current elevated demand while sigma uses recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock near current pipeline (avoids over-ordering) while allowing safety for observed variability.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=4); recent demand has shifted sharply higher \u2014 recent 6-period demands (P18\u2013P23) avg = 75.33 vs earlier lower regimes. To prioritize service during this sustained higher-demand regime, keep L at the promised/confirmed 4 and forecast using the most recent demand window. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand average across the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This focuses stocking on the new demand regime while relying on observed lead-time consistency to avoid underordering despite past missing shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been high and stable since the regime shift noted earlier (P13\u2013P17 and sustained thereafter). On-hand=75, in-transit=201 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (last 5 weekly demands = 57,93,97,108,101) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility similarly uses recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit stock limits aggressive ordering, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been high and stable compared with earlier regimes: last 6 observed demands (Periods 20\u201325) = [57,93,97,108,101,71], avg \u2248 88.3. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=4 and in-transit=325 (large pipeline) so avoid aggressive ordering; let OR cap handle net order. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current high-demand regime while (1+L) scaling is done by backend. This balances service level against high holding cost given sizeable pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Promised L=4; historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in prior periods). On-hand=12, in-transit=346 \u2014 pipeline is well above (1+L)-horizon demand, so we should not increase forecasted demand or inflate safety stock. Use default lead time (promised), default mu_hat (uses all samples) and default sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute base stock; given current large pipeline the capped policy will yield little or no new order, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been elevated vs early-year baseline: last 7-period avg demand \u2248 93.9 units (P21\u2013P27), while historical sample mean = 32.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=255 (covers multiple future periods). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect confirmed reality. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (reduces underordering risk). These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock matching current demand while keeping cap constraints to limit excess inventory given holding cost=$1/unit same as profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has rebounded sharply (recent weeks: P24\u2013P28 demands = 101,71,82,105,137) after prior regime shifts; on-hand=0, in-transit=351 (covers multiple outstanding orders). Historical concluded messages consistently show lead_time=4 (many P->P+4 arrivals). To protect service during the current high-demand regime while capping excessive holding cost, I set L to be inferred from observations, and use recent demand (N=6) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the current higher mean and volatility rather than long-ago low-demand periods. This favors higher ordering to avoid stockouts given substantial in-transit but zero on-hand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and large in-transit pipeline (366) with on-hand=1. Demand has been volatile with recent high peaks, but pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover multiple weeks. Several previously delayed shipments have concluded and lead time stability is confirmed, so use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean/variance) to avoid overreacting to recent spikes and to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=255, promised L=4. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (many concludes show W=4), so infer lead time using observed data. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (carry-over notes avg P13\u2013P17=117 and subsequent high weeks); recent demand (Periods 25\u201330 = 71,82,105,137,123,132) averages ~108, clearly above long-run historical mean. I use L calculated from observed lead times to confirm actual lead time; for demand I use recent_N with N=6 to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast on the current high-demand regime. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the current high-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand data; they also let the OR engine cap orders per its policy given the large in-transit position.

Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 13; to capture the recent high-mean regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (uses last 20 demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std.

Recent demand regime is the higher regime (Periods 29\u201334 average \u2248105.5/week); use recent data to set forecast and volatility over that regime (N=6). These choices keep the OR base-stock tuned to the current high-demand regime while recognizing confirmed L=4 and existing in-transit stock to avoid excessive additional ordering.

To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=6) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the recent demand pattern. Current on-hand(91)+in-transit(299)=390 vs recent (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*102.2 \u2248 511 \u2014 this signals the backend may still order to top up pipeline if needed. Methods chosen balance service under the sustained high-demand regime while using observed lead time stability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows actual lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods; demand has had multiple regime shifts historically but most recent sustained shifts already recorded in carry-over. Current inventory: on-hand=194, in-transit=238 (ample pipeline). Given promised lead time=4 and confirmed historical LT=4, use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; with profit=holding cost (q=0.5) the backend will center base stock at the mean and cap orders appropriately. This is conservative given large on-hand + in-transit; avoids overreacting to recent spikes while preserving service level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=113, in-transit=230 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; keep promised/default lead time. Demand has been elevated in recent months; use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the current higher regime (N=8 covers recent weeks while avoiding too-short noise). Use default sigma_hat to let backend use long-run volatility scaled by (1+L). This choice keeps orders responsive to the recent higher demand while avoiding additional inventory given already-large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been elevated versus early-period lows; on-hand=36, in-transit=330 (sufficient pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4. To keep the OR backend responsive to the most recent demand regime while respecting the promised lead time, I use default lead time and recent-N demand estimates based on the most recent 6 demand observations to capture current demand level and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts) with holding cost given large pipeline.

Profit=Holding, so service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) -> base_stock equals mu_hat; with substantial pipeline I avoid increasing forecast or volatility adjustments. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from history). This prevents additional ordering pressure while honoring observed LT=4 and recent demand regimes recorded in carry-over.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=79, in-transit=189. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use calculate to let backend confirm average lead time=4. Recent demand (Periods 36-41 = 46,89,77,65,54,68) shows a stable higher regime vs earlier history; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling uses the most recent regime to avoid overreacting to older low-demand periods. This balances service (cover upcoming 5-period demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so moderate safety stock from recent variability is appropriate.

Recent demand (last several concludes) sits ~60s per period vs older samples; to reflect current regime I set demand estimates using recent data (recent_N=6) so base-stock and cap adapt to the higher recent mean and volatility while honoring promised L=4. No evidence of new sustained changepoint since prior insights.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly demand has recovered from mid-year lows and appears around ~50\u201370 units/week over the last 6 periods. On-hand=126 and in-transit=195 (healthy pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently equal promised 4 periods; earlier delayed/lost concerns were resolved when late shipments arrived. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4). To reflect the recent higher-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand weeks, I set mu_hat using a recent_N window (N=6) to capture the current demand level across the review+lead horizon. Volatility remains well-captured by the long-run estimate, so sigma_hat stays default. These choices provide the OR backend a base-stock tuned to the recent demand spike while relying on default variability and the confirmed promised lead time, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=131, in-transit=173. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. Demand has had multiple regime shifts earlier but most recent periods (P40\u2013P44) show lower/volatile demand; therefore use recent_N=6 to focus mu/sigma on the latest regime and avoid stale long-run averages. This balances service (cover short-term holiday uncertainty) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* = 0.5 quantile; recent-based mu/sigma reduce risk of overordering from older high-demand spikes. No overdue/lost shipments currently (in-transit present and past arrivals consistent with L=4).

Recent demand (Periods 42\u201346 = 63,26,17,66,53) shows a higher short-run mean vs long-run baseline; to reflect current regime while limiting holding, I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent demand over the review+lead window.
