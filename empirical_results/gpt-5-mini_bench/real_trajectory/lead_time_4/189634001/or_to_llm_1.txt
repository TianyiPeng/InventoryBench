Risk trade-off: Profit $4 vs holding $1 (critical fractile q=0.8) favors stocking up, but the spike is currently a single-period event (not yet sustained for 3+ periods) so we should not fully assume a new long-run regime. Adjustment decision: increase OR recommendation to provide a buffer for a possible multi-week holiday uplift while avoiding extreme overstock.
