Incoming pipeline provides 1,186 units (arriving this period), leaving an estimated shortfall \u2248 399 units for the next 5 weeks. Risk: possible holiday spike, but holding cost equals profit so excess inventory is costly. Action: place a conservative top-up to cover shortfall with minimal safety stock. ",
