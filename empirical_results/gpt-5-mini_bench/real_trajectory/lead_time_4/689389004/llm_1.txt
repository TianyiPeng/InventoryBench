Product is a women's blouse \u2014 modest seasonal sensitivity (spring transition), no immediate holiday drivers in mid-February besides Valentine's Day (could slightly increase apparel demand, but effect uncertain).

Promised lead time = 4 periods; with ordering now, arrivals won't occur until Period 5 arrival resolution (you will only observe in Period 6 conclude). There is no on-hand or in-transit stock, so current and upcoming demand will be unmet unless we cover pipeline.

Use forecast ~100 units/week \u2192 target pipeline \u2248 100\xd75 = 500 units.
