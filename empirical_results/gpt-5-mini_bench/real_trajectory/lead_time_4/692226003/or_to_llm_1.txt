For review+lead (1+L=5) OR computed \u03bc\u0302 = 5\xd7114.2 = 571 units (\u03c3\u0302 \u224873.5). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so pipeline_inventory=0. OR recommended 169 (its cap constrained the uncapped base-stock of ~692 down to ~169). Decision logic: With profit=$19 >> holding=$1, the critical fractile is 0.95 and service is important; moreover there is zero on-hand and zero pipeline, so we would face large stockouts over the next 5 periods if we only ordered OR's 169. The checklist guidance recommends covering (L+1) periods of demand with order+on-hand+in-transit. Therefore I order the full expected demand over the horizon: 571 units to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) at the historical mean, accepting holding costs because profit per unit far outweighs holding cost and there is no evidence shipments are lost or lead time reduced. Strategy: place a one-time order of 571 now; monitor concluded arrivals in future periods to adjust if actual lead time differs or demand regime shifts.",

Among these periods one observed demand (period 8) was censored by stockout (demand reported 215 but sold 127), indicating upside risk. Profitability favors avoiding missed sales (profit $19 vs holding $1); shortfall to cover (5-period target using recent mean) \u2248 714\u2212661 \u2248 53 units. Decision: place a modest replenishment to cover this gap while avoiding large excess that increases holding cost and ties up pipeline. I therefore order 54 units (rounding up to reduce stockout risk). This minimally increases pipeline to ~715, which should cover ~5 periods at the recent realized demand level.

Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit, so excess inventory severely penalizes reward if we over-order.

This avoids additional holding cost and risk of further overstocks given the sustained low demand and large on-hand buffer.
