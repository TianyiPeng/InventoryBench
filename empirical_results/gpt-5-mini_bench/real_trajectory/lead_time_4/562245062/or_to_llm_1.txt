I increase OR's capped recommendation modestly to 170 units (+8.3% vs OR 157) to provide extra coverage for the upward trend while limiting excess holding (profit and holding cost equal).

Required coverage for (L+1)=5 periods using conservative recent average (\u224855) \u2248275 units. Current pipeline (459) comfortably exceeds 5-period demand even under higher recent-5 average (124.8 \u2192 demand5\u2248624, but this is driven by one extreme stockout period; using that as persistent would be overly reactive).
