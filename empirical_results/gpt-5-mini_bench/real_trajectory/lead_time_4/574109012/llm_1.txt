Recent mean = ~78 units/week but median ~60; the 198 observation appears to be a single-week spike/outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time and no in-transit inventory. Treat promised LT=4 but remain cautious about lost/delayed shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so current cover is zero. With LT=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given high holding cost equal to unit profit, avoid overstocking to reduce holding penalties; use conservative demand estimate (median ~60/week) rather than mean influenced by spike. e) Final order logic: Order to cover ~5 weeks \xd7 60 units/week = 300 units to meet expected demand over lead time while limiting excess holding cost.
