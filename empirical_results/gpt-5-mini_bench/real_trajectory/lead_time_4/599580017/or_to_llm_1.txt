Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward pattern in recent weeks (61 \u2192 98 \u2192 152), so short-run demand likely above the long-run mean that OR used. OR recommended 170 (its capped base-stock using promised L and full history). Reasoning: need (L+1)=5 periods cover after ordering. OR's cap restrained the uncapped base-stock (\u03bc\u0302 from full-history =311) down to 170; given the recent upward trend I increase exposure moderately to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost (profit=holding so overstocks are costly).

Demand analysis: recent realized demands are volatile but the most recent concluded period (P26) demand=176; earlier weeks showed very high peaks (up to 771) but those peaks were satisfied or stock-limited and created large ordering upstream. With Profit = Holding = $1, the critical fractile is 0.5 so safety stocking is minimal; holding inventory is expensive relative to incremental profit. OR suggests ordering 122 units based only on historical mean and promised L, but it cannot see that we already hold 1,497 units and that there are no pipeline arrivals. Decision: place no order (0 units). Rationale: avoid additional holding cost because current on-hand inventory already covers multiple future periods even if demand returns to recent high levels (1,497 units would cover ~2\u20133+ high-demand periods); ordering now would only increase holding cost without clear need.
