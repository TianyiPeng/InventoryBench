Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand mean = 266.4 (5 samples). No evidence of changepoint or lead-time drift. Use defaults so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std to balance service vs holding given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (historical weeks Jan 7\u2013Feb 4) average ~266 units/week; Period 1 concluded demand=287 (not yet a sustained shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=310 (order placed but not yet concluded as arrived). No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Use default lead time (promised L=4) so backend uses promised LT; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample history while the pipeline (310) covers part of the (L+1) demand horizon; defaults balance service vs holding cost until we observe sustained changes or concluded arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=621; two recent concludes show ordered units have not yet arrived (Period1 arrived=0, Period2 arrived=0) but this is only 2 periods of non-arrival\u2014insufficient to confirm lost shipments or a lead-time shift. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting. Demand shows a recent spike (Period2 demand=548) but limited evidence for a sustained regime change; to balance responsiveness and stability, forecast using the last 5 demand samples (captures Jan historical weeks plus the two recent weeks) so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5. Keep sigma_hat as default to reflect overall historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This choice raises target stock to cover the observed spike while remaining conservative about lead-time reliability and avoiding overcommitment given potential lost arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1135 equals sum of prior orders (310+311+514). No concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised (promised L=4); orders placed in P1\u2013P3 would not conclude by P4. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean=266.4 and std\u224823.29; using default formulas with L=4 yields mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. Using defaults balances service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff while respecting promised lead time and current in-transit stock (no premature adjustment for lost shipments).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=1628. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) avg ~266 units. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have concluded as arrived=0; however, per rules this is expected while promised lead time=4 (we will only see arrivals in concludes after the arrival period). No concluded arrivals yet and no 3+ period evidence of a changed lead time or demand regime, so retain promised lead time and use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. This balances service (use historical mean across review+lead) while avoiding overreacting to possibly delayed shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Observed one concluded arrival: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5 \u2192 actual lead time = 4, matching promised. On-hand=58, in-transit=1664. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average \u2248266.4 units. I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses promised L=4 and the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std). This is appropriate because lead time is confirmed at 4 and there is no sustained demand regime shift in the short history; using defaults balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (ordered on Period 1 arrived on Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand samples average ~266/week (historical samples: 231,255,302,272,272). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1\u21925, Period 2\u21926). Current inventory: on-hand=40, in-transit=1559 (large pipeline). To let the OR engine apply its calibrated policy using full-sample statistics and the promised/confirmed lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise given the very large in-transit balance and preserves service while limiting extra holding.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=139, in-transit=1362. Concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 confirm actual lead time = 4. To reflect confirmed lead time, set L method to calculate. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-7) shows elevated mean (~367/week); to capture current regime I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (scale by 1+L) and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Parameters aim to keep pipeline+on-hand sufficient for (L+1)=5 weeks of demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded periods show steady high weekly demand (demands in concludes: 252,329,415,382) and on-hand=250 with in-transit=1398; prior samples (Jan) mean=266.4. Carry-over confirmed lead time=4. Use L=default (promised=4) to respect confirmed observation. Use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures baseline demand across review+lead). Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreaction to short-term variability given large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has increased versus older samples: last 5 realized weekly demands = [252,329,415,382,322] (mean=340) vs earlier historical mean ~266. On-hand=274, in-transit=1375 (pipeline=1649) \u2014 ample coverage but demand regime has shifted upward so forecast should use recent data. Lead time observed repeatedly = 4 periods, so use promised/default L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility in the last 5 periods, improving service while avoiding excess holding given high pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=62, in-transit=1450, profit=$19, holding=$1. Lead time was confirmed at 4 periods in history; demand history (samples mean=266.4) shows no recent sustained regime shift. To keep the OR engine aligned with confirmed lead time and the long-run demand sample, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This preserves service (high pipeline) while avoiding unnecessary manual overrides given large in-transit stock.

=== Period 12 Summary ===
372860001: ordered=462, arrived=529 units (ordered on Period 8, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=591, demand=438, sold=438, ending on-hand inventory=153
Daily Profit: $8322.00, Daily Holding Cost: $153.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $8169.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history shows consistent demand (period demands ~252\u2013438) and lead time confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand=153, in-transit=1383 \u2014 pipeline is ample vs promised L=4. I select default methods so the OR backend uses promised lead time (4) and all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This is conservative given large pipeline and high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), letting the backend target a high service level while capping orders via its cap formula.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals from Periods 1-9). On-hand=209, in-transit=1533 => pipeline+on-hand=1742 units, which comfortably covers several weeks of demand. Historic sample mean = 266.4 (from provided samples); with promised lead time 4 I use default statistical aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. Using defaults keeps parameters tied to long-run data while the large pipeline mitigates stockout risk and avoids excess new ordering given holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent observed demand has been higher and more variable than the early Jan samples (recent week demands: 382,322,308,427,438,267,275), while on-hand=215 and in-transit=1496 (strong pipeline). Lead time has already been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude. To keep enough coverage of the (1+L) review+lead window while reflecting the recent demand regime, I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 demand observations; this reduces risk of understocking from elevated recent demand while the large pipeline limits holding-cost exposure.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Current on-hand=184, in-transit=1455. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline is large and covers multiple cycles; no overdue/lost shipments evident. Use promised/confirmed lead time to let OR backend compute (1+L)-horizon demand and safety stock from full sample history: select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend applies its calibrated base-stock and cap given profit/holding tradeoff.

On-hand=276, in-transit=1316 \u2014 pipeline plus on-hand comfortably covers expected demand over lead+review. Demand history (samples mean ~266.4) appears stable so use aggregate defaults.

Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep forecasting consistent and avoid overreacting. Select default demand estimates so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples; this balances service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) while avoiding excess safety stock given large pipeline.

This balances service (using confirmed L=4) with holding cost by letting the engine compute the safety stock given profit/holding parameters.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=404, in-transit=1232. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed Period 6). Demand history shows stable weekly demand patterns. I use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand/std estimation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history and the confirmed LT=4 to produce base-stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Defaults also keep the capped order conservative given large pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). SKU 372860001 has on-hand=455 and in-transit=1167; promised lead time=4 and prior concludes consistently show actual lead time=4 (confirmed in Period 6). Demand historical samples (5 weekly observations from Jan\u2013Feb) will be used as baseline. To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting the backend set safety stock via the profit/holding ratio. No evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time regime that requires deviating from defaults.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weeks show steady weekly demand (~250-430 historically) and current inventory is high: on-hand=459, in-transit=1109. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods. To be conservative and leverage full history I select default settings so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against low holding cost ($1) given large pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-08-26 (Period 29). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with many concluded arrivals at lead_time=4 (consistent deliveries from Periods 5\u201328). On-hand=517 + in-transit=1051 provides strong coverage vs expected demand; no overdue/lost shipments observed recently. I keep L at the promised lead time to match confirmed pattern and use default demand/volatility estimation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
2019-09-02: demand in recent months has been stable/seasonal around ~250\u2013350 weekly; on-hand=554 and in-transit=1072 (healthy coverage). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. To reflect the stable recent demand regime while leveraging rich recent history, use promised lead time and recent-N demand estimates (captures latest mean/volatility) so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=288, in-transit=1218. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed at Period 6 and repeatedly thereafter). Inventory coverage is ample from pipeline. Use promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand statistics: set L to default (promised = 4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all. This keeps the OR engine aligned with observed stable demand and the confirmed lead time, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=432, in-transit=1100. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in history). Demand history shows stable weekly demand around mid-200s\u2013300s. I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time and leverages full-sample stats while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=499, in-transit=1062. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Inventory pipeline (499+1062) is ample vs recent demand, so use standard/default estimates to let OR backend compute base stock from full-sample demand stats and promised lead time. This favors service (high profit $19) while relying on backend cap to limit over-ordering and contain holding cost.

Demand history shows stable weekly demand (historical samples cover Jan\u2013Nov with no sustained regime change). Given confirmed LT=4 and no evidence of recent demand shift, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using full history) and holding cost (avoids overreacting to noise).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3463.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent concluded history (through Period 41) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed at Period 6 and every subsequent conclude). On-hand = 527 and in-transit = 1050 provides strong pipeline cover versus typical weekly demand (historical sample mean ~266.4 per week); with promised/observed L=4 I will use defaults so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/std. Using defaults keeps the backend's statistical estimate and service-level tradeoff (profit $19 vs holding $1) aligned with stable historical demand and confirmed lead time. No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments in recent concludes, so no explicit adjustments.

Product profit/holding ratio implies a high target service level (q\u22480.95). I keep L as default (promised 4) and use default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this leverages the long-run demand data and the confirmed lead time to achieve high fill while the low holding cost tolerates larger safety stock.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been stable with no new changepoint; on-hand=602, in-transit=1038 (healthy pipeline). Prior concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = promised 4 periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with stable demand and confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this balances service level vs holding cost given high pipeline and steady demand.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows no sustained regime shift\u2014weekly demand mostly in 200\u2013400 range with some seasonal variation but no multi-period spike. I therefore use the promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4, and default demand/volatility calculations so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps the policy stable given ample pipeline inventory while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using full-sample statistics.
