No major positive seasonal driver for basic T-shirt; post-holiday winter period typically sees softer demand for basics. b) Demand analysis: historical weekly demand for SKU 717490001 shows a downward pattern over the 5 samples (2019-01-07:100, 01-14:66, 01-21:70, 01-28:62, 02-04:53). Recent 3-week average \u224861 units/week; recent variance moderate. c) Lead time & orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals in history to contradict promised lead time. d) Inventory/pipeline assessment: With promised L=4, decision must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand (current week included) because arrivals happen after the decision and demand occurs this period. e) Order logic: Use conservative forecast ~60 units/week \xd7 5 weeks = 300 units to cover expected demand and avoid stockouts given long lead time. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit, but service is prioritized because stockouts over a 4-period lead time will be costly. Therefore place order for 300 units.",

Historical demand (Periods 43-46): 42, 39, 50, 33 => avg \u224841 units/week. Promised lead time = 4 (confirmed repeatedly in conclude messages). Pipeline today: on-hand=376 + in-transit=205 => total supply=581. Required cover for (L+1)=5 upcoming periods using forecasted demand 41 \u2248 205 units. Inventory (581) far exceeds 5-period requirement; holding cost = $1/unit/period makes excess inventory costly. No evidence of lost orders. Therefore place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and allow inventory burn-down over low-demand holiday weeks.",
