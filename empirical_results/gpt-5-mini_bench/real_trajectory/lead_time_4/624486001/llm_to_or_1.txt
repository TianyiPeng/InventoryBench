Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) L=4. Historical weekly samples (55,60,66,88,108) cover recent demand; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Profit=Holding => critical fractile q=0.5 (balanced service vs holding). This conservative default covers the review+lead period while avoiding overreaction to limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb): 55,60,66,88,108 (mean=75.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=112 (order from P1 not yet concluded; promised L=4 so arrivals expected later). No concluded arrivals yet \u2192 no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Demand shows upward trend but only 5 samples; not yet 3+ period sustained changepoint. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes L=4. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand based on available history. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability across the (1+L) horizon. These conservative defaults let the OR engine size orders recognizing current pipeline (112) is below the (1+L) demand forecast (~377), prompting replenishment while avoiding overreaction to a short recent rise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-02-25. Recent observed concluded periods show no arrivals (Period1 ordered=112 arrived=0; Period2 ordered=116 arrived=0) but this is within promised lead time window so actual lead time cannot be inferred yet. Demand has shown upward pressure (historical Jan samples 55\u2192108; recent concluded demands 98 then 162) so I bias the demand forecast toward recent data using EWMA to react to the increase while avoiding overfitting. I keep L at default (promised) because we have insufficient concluded evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. sigma_hat left as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices raise the base-stock moderately to protect service level given rising demand while not overly increasing holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent historical weekly demand samples show an upward trend (55,60,66,88,108) but no clear regime change yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=419 which equals the sum of prior orders (no concluded arrivals yet) \u2014 not evidence of lost shipments because promised lead time is 4 and those orders would only conclude after Period 5/6. Be conservative: use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples to set base stock while keeping pipeline coverage aligned with promised lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent realized weekly demand (periods 1-4) = [98,162,134,111], mean=126.25 vs historical sample mean=77.4 \u2014 a clear upward regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer a lead-time change, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent demand surge, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (recent_N, N=4). L kept default (promised) so the OR backend computes (1+L) multiples correctly while recent_N demand inputs raise target base-stock and safety stock to reduce stockouts given the sustained higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 conclude: mean increased from 77.4 to 126.25 (+63%) over 4 most recent periods

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded arrival (Period 5) confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (Period1\u2192Period5). On-hand=0, in-transit=520 (pipeline present). Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime over the last 4 periods (recent mean 126.25). To capture the confirmed lead time I use calculate for L (backend will average observed lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to focus the forecast on the new higher regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises base_stock to meet higher demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand data; using recent volatility preserves service-level calibration while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=547 (large pipeline). Recent demand has shifted up (carry-over notes +63% over last 4 periods). To capture the new regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (focus on the 4 most recent demand samples) while keeping L at the promised/default value. This increases mu_hat to reflect the higher recent mean and uses recent volatility for sigma_hat so the OR backend raises the base-stock to improve service while the large pipeline limits additional ordering risk.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand has risen sharply (Period4-7 demands = 111,123,182,205) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=497 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals are lagged). Observed concluded lead times (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times. For demand, I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher regime (uses last 4 demand samples across review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the OR backend on the elevated recent mean and variance so base-stock increases to reduce lost sales while capping orders to control holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Observed sustained demand increase starting at Period 1 conclude: recent 4-period mean (~126.25) is ~63% above earlier long-run mean. All concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Periods 1-4 arrivals in 5-8). To capture the new higher demand regime I set L to calculated (use observed lead times) and use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend bases base_stock on the most recent higher-demand regime and the confirmed lead time. This preserves service through the lead time while avoiding overstating older low-demand data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=764. Concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for five observed orders (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9) so L should reflect observed lead time. Demand has shifted up since early periods; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5-9) = [123,182,205,221,186], indicating a sustained higher regime. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time (confirmed=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine targets a larger base-stock while respecting holding cost tradeoff. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time) vs holding cost by using recent demand mean/variance rather than long-ago low historical samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (recent weekly demand ~205). On-hand=0, in-transit=774 \u2014 pipeline looks large but likely insufficient for (1+L) periods at the new regime. Observed arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 weeks). For sigma I use recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping variance estimates focused on the recent regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and long lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10)

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has risen sharply: last 4 observed weekly demands = [221,186,206,267], mean \u2248220 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=862 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover multiple weeks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in conclude messages, so use promised lead time. To reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the 4-period regime (N=4). Volatility also should reflect recent variability, so set sigma_hat recent_N with N=4. These choices make the backend target a base-stock sized to recent higher mean demand while the sigma estimate captures current variability; using recent data avoids diluting the shift with older low-demand samples and helps balance service level vs holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=105, in-transit=762. Observed lead time has been stable at 4 periods (confirmed historically). Pipeline + on-hand currently covers multiple upcoming periods but demand recently elevated and volatile (recent demands: P7..P14 = 205,221,186,206,267,229,128,171). To capture the recent higher mean while letting OR backend compute safety stock, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to reflect the last 8 demand observations (captures current regime). Use recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window and reduces stockouts given sustained higher demand while letting backend cap orders per its policy.

I set L to default (promised 4) to match confirmed lead time and avoid underordering if shipments delayed. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (most recent 4 demand samples: P12-P15 mean=176.5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean and captures the higher current demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit = holding cost) by aligning base-stock to the observed higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excess safety stock.

Historical concludes show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime in recent periods (recent demands: P13-16 = 128,171,178,239).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-10: recent demand has risen substantially vs. historical seed samples\u2014last 8 demands show a sustained higher regime (recent weekly demand ~170\u2013239, avg \u2248 ~196.8). On-hand=97 + in-transit=599 = 696 units (covers multiple weeks of demand and pipeline); no new evidence of lead-time change (confirmed LT=4 in history). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture recent elevated mean/variance. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 4) because observed conclues consistently match promised LT. These parameters increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to balance holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=100, in-transit=719. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5 ... P14->P18). Demand regime increased starting Period 5 (carry-over): recent demand is materially higher than early samples. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (use the last 4 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), which keeps target base-stock responsive to the sustained shift while avoiding overreaction to single-period noise. This balances service (profit per unit = holding cost) by sizing safety stock to recent variability and using the confirmed L to align pipeline coverage.

Pipeline + on-hand already cover several future periods. I set L to default (promised lead time=4) consistent with observed confirmations. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher recent mean/volatility (recent periods show repeatedly elevated weekly demand ~150\u2013239), so the OR backend will size base stock to meet the new regime while accounting for current large pipeline to avoid excessive additional ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=836 \u2014 strong pipeline but no available inventory today. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand regime shift was observed starting at Period 1 conclude and persists (higher recent demand vs original sample). I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (regime from Period 5 onward, 16 concluded periods available) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 16 demand samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=16 to capture current volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned to the sustained higher-demand regime while the recent-N volatility narrows service-level surprises and avoids excessive holding given a large pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=79, in-transit=711. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has risen: last 4 concluded demands = [151,197,196,172], mean=179, indicating the higher-demand regime noted earlier. I therefore keep L at promised/confirmed lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture the current elevated mean and volatility (recent_N N=4). This aims to align base stock to the new regime while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has settled above earlier baseline (sustained higher weekly sales since Period 5); on-hand=199, in-transit=542 (healthy pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while focusing on the most relevant recent weeks, I use L=default (promised 4). For demand across review+lead (1+L=5), I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the last 8 concluded weekly demands (captures recent mean ~180s and recent variability) so mu_hat and sigma_hat respond to the current regime without overreacting to single-week noise. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high pipeline usage) against holding cost by anchoring on recent demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=219, in-transit=590. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4. Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period 5; recent week-to-week variability has moderated but remains elevated. To match the confirmed L=4 while capturing the recent elevated demand regime, I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using the last 8 observed demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This keeps orders responsive to the recent higher mean and recent volatility while not overreacting to single-week noise. No evidence of new lost shipments beyond the previously recorded patterns.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand 260, in-transit 503. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 21-24 = 172, 154, 120, 130) shows a downward shift vs earlier high-volume periods; I target the recent regime to avoid overstock. Set L to promised (default) since observations confirm 4. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend's (1+L) scaling reflects the latest lower mean and volatility, reducing excess holding while preserving service given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=300 + in-transit=377 = 677 units in pipeline. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. Pipeline (~677) covers roughly 5 periods of recent demand, so maintain conservative forecast using the post-changepoint regime. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (changepoint at Period 5, regime length \u226520). Use recent_N N=20 for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher mean while using observed variability to limit overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-08-12. Recent demand regime (noted earlier) is higher and sustained since Period 5; current on-hand=351, in-transit=500 so pipeline is ample vs recent weekly sales. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes consistently confirm LT=4, so use default lead time. To align forecast with the recent high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness, I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent weeks (captures current mean/variance without overreacting to single-week noise). This keeps base_stock tuned to recent demand and limits excess orders given significant on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=483, in-transit=312. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime beginning early periods (previously noted). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). To keep forecasts responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while leveraging many recent observations, I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 20 demand samples \u2014 this balances higher service (to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost since on-hand is already large. These choices acknowledge confirmed lead time, react to the sustained demand increase, and let the OR engine cap ordering appropriately given pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=508, in-transit=268 (large pipeline). Promised lead time 4 has been consistently observed in history; no new lead-time evidence. Recent weekly demand (last ~8 concl.) has been much lower (~50-90) than earlier spring peaks, so use a recent-window demand estimate to avoid excess stocking given current high inventory. Set L=default to keep promised lead time=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current lower-summer demand regime and reduced volatility, which reduces the base-stock target and holding risk while preserving service given pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 26-29: 54,56,59,61). On-hand=447, in-transit=268 \u2014 ample pipeline relative to recent demand; no new evidence of lead-time change (lead time previously confirmed=4). Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to anchor the (1+L) forecast to the latest low-demand regime and reduce excess holding. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect current low volatility. This balances service against holding cost given high inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent on-hand=646, in-transit=40; promised lead time=4 and historical concludes repeatedly confirm LT=4. Demand has fallen markedly in the last several periods (P25\u2013P30: 86,54,56,59,61,29), indicating a new low-demand regime. I set L to default (use promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent low-demand regime ((1+L)-period demand mean and volatility computed from the last 6 samples), which reduces ordering relative to older high-demand data and limits holding cost given already-large on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 25: avg demand over P25\u2013P30 = 57.5 vs prior multi-period averages ~150\u2013200 (\u2248-62%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has fallen sharply and persistently starting Period 25 (P25\u2013P31: 86,54,56,59,61,29,38 \u2014 sustained low regime). On-hand=608 + in-transit=40 => large pipeline (covers many weeks of current low demand), so we should base demand forecast on the recent low regime. Lead time observed historically = 4; use calculated avg lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the new low-mean, lower-volatility regime (N chosen to cover the full recent regime P25\u2013P31). These parameters will reduce ordering to avoid high holding costs while preserving service for the lowered demand level.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=620, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 observations). Demand has shifted down starting Period 25 (P25\u2013P32 demand series: 86,54,56,59,61,29,38,28), a sustained low-demand regime (regime length=8). To reflect confirmed lead time and the recent low-demand regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the last 8 weeks. This reduces ordering to match lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given high holding=$1/unit/period and current large on-hand stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=588, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted down starting Period 25 (P25\u2013P30 avg=57.5, then P31\u2013P33: 38,28,32) \u2014 a sustained low-demand regime. Lead time observations from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (multiple P arrivals confirm). To avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand balance and sustained lower demand, keep lead time estimate based on observed history and use a recent-sample demand forecast focused on the low-demand regime (last 6 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower mean/volatility and reduce recommended replenishment. These parameters align the OR backend to favor much smaller orders versus using the older high-demand history.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=551, in-transit=0; no arrivals scheduled (recent orders absent). Historical concludes confirm promised lead time=4. Recent demand has moved to a lower regime: last 6 demands (Periods 29\u201334) = [61,29,38,28,32,37], avg=37.5. To avoid excess holding cost while covering review+lead demand, I set L=default (promised 4). I set mu_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime ((1+L) multiplier applied by backend). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base_stock to match the new lower demand level and limit additional replenishment since on-hand inventory is already high.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted again starting Period 29: avg demand P29\u2013P34 = 37.5 vs prior P25\u2013P30 = 57.5 (\u221234%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 29; last 7 demands (P29\u2013P35) = [61,29,38,28,32,37,21], mean \u224835.1. On-hand=530, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory already >> (1+L)*mean, so likely no replenishment needed. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised = 4) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (regime length=7). These parameters inform the OR backend to target a base stock reflecting the low recent mean while the large on-hand will drive orders to zero under the capped policy, avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=497, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled into a low regime since Period 29; last 8 demands (P29\u2013P36) average \u224834.9 units/week, well below earlier seasons. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and sustained low demand, use promised lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 8 periods to reflect the new low-demand regime so the OR backend reduces target base-stock accordingly.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (recent weekly demands: 61,29,38,28,32,37,21,33,42). On-hand=455, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage versus low recent demand; avoid excess holding cost. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 (no change), so use promised lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (regime length=9) to capture the sustained lower mean/variance and reduce target base stock accordingly. This reduces unnecessary ordering and holding while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=431, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 repeatedly; recent demand regime is the low-demand regime that began around Period 29 (weekly demands ~20\u201360). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the low-demand regime (periods 29\u201338, regime length=10) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to measure volatility in the same recent regime. These choices keep safety stock aligned with the sustained low demand and avoid excess holdings while preserving service given the confirmed lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand regime is low and sustained since Period 29 (weekly sales mostly in the 20s\u201360s, recent weeks ~24). On-hand = 407, in-transit = 0 so current inventory is ample vs low demand; no overdue arrivals in history. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. To avoid overstock while meeting low current demand, keep promised lead time and base demand forecasts on the full recent low-demand regime. I set L using the default promised lead time, mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Period 29\u201339, length 11) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std; this tightens orders to current low demand and reduces holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=385, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs. current low demand (recent weeks ~20\u201340 units). Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=4 previously; recent sustained low-demand regime starting around Period 29 continuing through Period 40. To avoid overstock while matching recent demand, use lead time = promised (default) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 12 periods to capture the low-demand regime (reduces \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 vs older high-demand data). This keeps base-stock responsive to current low sales and limits holding cost given high current inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 29 (demands: P29\u2013P41 = 61,29,38,28,32,37,21,33,42,24,24,22,18; sustained low demand for 13 periods). On-hand=367, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage for the low-demand regime, so avoid large replenishment. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded LT observations confirm 4; use default promised L. For demand forecast use recent_N over the 13-period low-demand regime to capture the new mean; match sigma to same recent window. These settings reduce target base_stock to reflect the sustained lower demand and limit holding costs while preserving service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand is 339, in-transit 0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 29 (P29\u2013P42 demands: 61,29,38,28,32,37,21,33,42,24,24,22,18,28) \u2014 sustained low-demand regime for 14 periods. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the current low-demand regime (N = regime length, between 3 and 20). This biases the OR backend toward much lower replenishment quantities to avoid high holding costs given profit=holding cost and large on-hand stock.

Lead time historically observed = 4 periods (confirmed in history). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (P29\u2013P43) so mu_hat reflects the reduced mean over the review+lead window. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=15 so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices lower target base-stock vs long-run averages to avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand and prolonged low demand.

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods previously, so keep promised L. To avoid ordering into already large stock while matching the new low-demand regime, set demand estimates using the recent 6-week regime. Choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent low-demand samples; this reduces target base stock and caps ordering given the high on-hand inventory, balancing service vs holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new late/lost shipments observed. Demand has been at a lower sustained level from P29\u2013P46 (typical weekly demand ~15\u201338). To avoid overstocking I keep promised lead time and base forecasts focused on the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (promised=4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (regime length P29\u2013P46 = 18 periods) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand samples, reducing order quantity and holding cost exposure while maintaining service given observed regime.
