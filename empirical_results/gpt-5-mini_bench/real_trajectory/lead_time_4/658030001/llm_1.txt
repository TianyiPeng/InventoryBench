This balances service (avoid stockouts given the sharp recent rise) against holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $19).

Demand regime analysis: Recent demands (Periods 41\u201343) = 44, 48, 17 \u2192 avg \u224836.3/week, which is ~49% below the prior ~71/week regime (Periods 36\u201339). This is a sustained 3-week low signal. Lead time / pipeline: Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; in-transit = 0, so no pending arrivals. Inventory assessment: On-hand = 374 units, which covers ~10.3 weeks at the recent avg (374 / 36.3) or ~5+ lead+current periods (need to cover L+1=5 periods). Ordering decision: Given confirmed LT=4, zero in-transit, a marked drop in demand sustained for 3 periods, and high on-hand inventory (covers >5 periods even under moderate demand), do not place an order to avoid holding cost drag. Action: order 0 units.",
