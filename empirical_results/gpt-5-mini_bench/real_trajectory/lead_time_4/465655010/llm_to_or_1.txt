Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples available: [175,46,37,127,216] (last sample 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods and no missing-shipment signals observed. Use default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a neutral base-stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=250 (ordered P1 but arrived=0 in P1 conclude), so no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 points, mean=120.2) show no confirmed recent regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base_stock and caps from full-sample stats while accommodating the current pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=485 (orders 250+235). No concluded arrivals yet (no observed lead times), so cannot infer actual lead time or changepoints. Use promised lead time (default) and historical demand samples (2019 weekly samples provided) for forecasting. Default mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean of all samples to cover review+lead period; default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This keeps OR backend conservative given large in-transit balance and absence of confirmed delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) mean ~120.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=485 (orders P1=250, P2=235) but no arrivals observed in concludes through Period 3. I will use default promised lead time (no concluded arrivals to infer a different L). Using default demand/volatility methods lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence to change estimates. Noted pipeline (485) is below the default (1+L) demand forecast (~601), so the backend may order to replenish.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/missing arrivals: orders placed P1=250 and P2=235 remain unarrived through Period 3 conclude (3 consecutive periods with no arrivals) \u2014 potential prolonged lead-time or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent demand spike (147 in Period 4) and historical weekly mean \u2248120.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=485 (orders from P1=250, P2=235) have not concluded through Period 4 conclude \u2014 shipments are overdue beyond promised L=4, suggesting prolonged lead time or partial loss. To be conservative I set lead time explicit=6 to force larger pipeline coverage. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (leveraging full history) which balances service (given recent spike) versus holding cost under the extended lead-time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=60, in-transit=384. Arrival in Period 5 shows order from Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4; Period 2 shipment still in-transit. Given confirmed lead_time evidence but limited lead-time samples, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times). Demand recently volatile but not a sustained 3+ period regime shift, so use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overfitting recent spikes. These choices let the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with observed lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats for stability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=117, in-transit=208. Historical concludes show orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6 with observed lead_time=4; shipments previously delayed are now confirmed as 4. To reflect confirmed lead time and use full historical demand, set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times =4). Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), producing forecasts that cover the full review+lead window (L+1 periods) and balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand: P5=190, P6=178, P7=59; historical samples available from Jan\u2013Feb. Current inventory: on-hand=58, in-transit=421. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=4). No other sustained regime change detected. To reflect confirmed lead time and use full-sample demand estimates, set L via calculate (average observed lead times =4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use confirmed L) with holding cost neutrality (profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand history shows intermittent spikes (samples: 175,46,37,127,216) with recent weekly demands: P5=190, P6=178, P7=59, P8=17; on-hand=41, in-transit=460 (these include two concluded arrivals confirming lead time=4). Two earlier orders experienced multi-period delay but P5/P6 confirms actual lead time=4. I choose L=calculate to use observed lead-time data (captures confirmed 4-period lead), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set. This balances service (using full-sample demand mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given profit=holding, relying on backend caps to limit order size versus pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-88.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-15 (Period 10). Current on-hand=139, in-transit=311. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 4-period arrivals (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->arrived P6), and recent demand samples include a large 190/147 week but overall samples produce stable baseline. Promised lead time=4 is confirmed; use L default to let backend use promised lead time. With profit=holding, service vs. holding tradeoff is balanced by backend base-stock using full-sample stats, so select mu_hat default and sigma_hat default to let OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to single spikes while ensuring inventory cover for (L+1) periods given current pipeline.

No new sustained demand regime change confirmed. Use calculated lead time (average of observed =4) so the backend accounts for true transit. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast given mixed recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=240, in-transit=205. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 periods (orders placed P1..P7 that concluded all indicate 4), and no current prolonged missing shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (matches promised 4). Demand/volatility show no clear recent regime shift; use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run mean and avoids overreacting to recent variability, balancing service level (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weekly demand has been variable but generally elevated after Period 5 (examples: 190,178,51,134). On-hand 263 + in-transit 184 = 447 units covers multiple weeks given confirmed lead time of ~4. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent demand regime: apply recent_N over the last 8 demand observations (Periods 5\u201312) to capture the post-arrival demand level and its variability. These parameters increase service (higher \u03bc\u0302) while \u03c3\u0302 from recent data captures current dispersion, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=178, in-transit=184. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1,P2,P5,P6,P7,P8 all arrived after 4 periods). No currently overdue unarrived shipments. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand history, use lead time inference from observations and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full-sample mean over the entire history) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* = 0.5; default dispersion captures historical variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=163, in-transit=244. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently; two earlier prolonged non-arrivals resolved when lead time=4 was observed. Demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) produce a stable baseline (mean \u2248120.2/week). No new sustained demand regime or lead-time change in recent concluded periods. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand-volatility methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, which balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost without overreacting to transient fluctuations.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has varied but historical sample mean (weeks in Jan) is 120.2; current inventory on-hand=303, in-transit=114 (healthy buffer). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (will produce ~4). For demand I use mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd7120.2 = 601) to keep the base-stock tied to long-run sample mean given no strong sustained regime shift. sigma_hat=default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (profit=holding cost so q=0.5) and inventory given current ample on-hand/pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has moderated: last 8 demands = [51,134,37,16,85,33,8,8], mean \u2248 41 units/week. On-hand=313 + in-transit=96 gives strong coverage relative to (1+L) demand. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (orders arriving after 4 periods) so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent lower average and reduced variability versus the full-history sample, use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a leaner base stock while preserving service. No new sustained regime changes to record.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=304, in-transit=96 \u2192 ample coverage versus recent low weekly demand (last 4 weeks: 33,8,8,9). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; earlier delayed arrivals were resolved and multiple orders show lead_time=4. To keep policy aligned with observed operations while letting backend compute required base-stock from historical sample mean/variance, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation. This avoids overreacting to short recent dip in demand and leverages confirmed LT=4 for replenishment sizing.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been low (last periods: 9,1,8,8,33,85,16,37,134,51 etc. with earlier spikes), current on-hand=381 + in-transit=18 provides strong cover vs. typical weekly demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 (observed arrivals: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so set lead time by calculated average. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to leverage all samples and smooth sporadic spikes; this balances service (high inventory given 1:1 profit/holding) while avoiding overreacting to recent noise.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24. Recent history shows stable low weekly demand (many weeks with single-digit sales) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from prior concludes. On-hand = 398, in-transit = 0 so no incoming arrivals expected. To reflect confirmed lead time and rely on long-run demand stats, set L by calculation (average observed lead times = 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given profit=holding cost and avoids overreacting to recent low sales while keeping safety stock for lead time coverage.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=297, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, and subsequent arrivals all with W=4). Recent demand shows a jump in the most recent 5 periods (demands: 8,9,1,1,101) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the latest regime while keeping L informed by observed lead times. I select L=calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (confirmed =4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to weight the last 5 demand observations (covering the review+lead horizon of 1+L=5 periods) so the OR engine raises base-stock to cover the recent spike but limits inventory with the backend cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent high demand) versus holding cost given sizeable on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Recent demand has a sharp uptick (last 5 demands: 9,1,1,101,274) so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the regime shift/volatility while keeping lead time estimate driven by observed arrivals.

Recent demand has risen markedly (periods 20-22: 101, 274, 225) vs earlier samples, so I bias mu_hat to recent data using recent_N with N=10 to capture the higher recent mean over the (1+L) review+lead window. sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to raise base-stock to cover the elevated recent demand while relying on observed lead-time behaviour to avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=373. Recent demand has risen sharply over Periods 20-23 (101,274,225,145) vs historical mean ~120, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 20\u201321. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N based on the detected changepoint: regime length=4 so N=4 to capture the new higher mean ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 4 samples). Volatility also uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the longer-run higher demand while keeping sigma responsive to recent variability; this helps the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed LT=4 and elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand increased from ~120.2 (historical sample mean) to 186.25 (Periods 20-23 mean) (+55%)

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 21: Periods 20-23 demands = [101,274,225,145], mean=186.25 (\u2248 +55% vs historical). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in prior concludes. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=688 (pipeline substantial but covers future demand partly). I set L=default to use the promised/observed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=4 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=989. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier), so keep promised lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up starting around Period 20 (periods 20-25 demands = [101,274,225,145,209,154]); I use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher regime. I select recent_N with N=6 (covers Periods 20-25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new higher mean and volatility; L uses default (promised). This biases the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while the recent_N sigma captures increased variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting ~Period 20 (Periods 20-26 demands = [101,274,225,145,209,154,71], elevated vs. historical mean). On-hand=201 + in-transit=717 => pipeline ample (918 units) but recent high demand warrants increasing target stock. Use L=default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (captures the new high-demand regime from Period 20\u201326). For sigma use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base_stock upward to protect service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma from recent data sets safety buffer; ample pipeline reduces urgency to order aggressively this period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals at W=4) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 21 (periods 21-27 show materially higher demand). On-hand=102, in-transit=616 (large pipeline). To capture the higher recent demand while keeping the OR engine aware of elevated variability, set L to promised (4) and compute demand and volatility from the most recent regime. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised lead time (promised=4, historically confirmed); mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect mean demand over Periods 21-27 (captures the +55% uplift); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the new higher demand while the large pipeline and confirmed lead-time limit over-ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks (Periods 20-28) show a sustained higher-demand regime (avg ~186 over P20-23 vs historical ~120). On-hand=226 + in-transit=496 = 722 units available. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I select L=default (promised 4) given confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 20-28) to capture the new higher regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias base_stock upward to maintain service during the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent samples to avoid overstating variability and excess holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=347, in-transit=346 \u2014 no currently overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set L using calculate to lock in observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 21\u201329) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean and volatility and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=277, in-transit=570 (no obvious lost shipments outstanding). To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default methods so backend computes L=promised, mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time, uses all available demand history to capture the recent regime shift implicitly, and balances service level vs holding cost under the engine's capped ordering policy.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand increased sharply starting Period 21 and has remained elevated; use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (consistent with observed 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 21\u201331 inclusive = 11 samples) to reflect the higher post-changepoint mean and volatility, which balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows consistent observed lead_time=4 in concluded messages and available pipeline (on-hand=414, in-transit=375). Demand has had a sustained uplift earlier (recorded previously) but recent weeks include high variability; to avoid overfitting to short fluctuations I use default (promised/long-run) demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

On-hand=754, in-transit=0 so we are currently well stocked. I set L to default (use promised lead time=4). To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=14 (Periods 21\u201334) which is the detected post-changepoint regime length; this biases the forecast and safety stock toward the new, higher demand while keeping pipeline assumptions aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given currently large on-hand inventory.

Given stable LT=4 and sufficient on-hand, use default estimators so OR backend applies promised lead time and baseline demand stats (samples mean=120.2 over provided historical samples).

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has settled far below the July peak: last 7 observed demands (Periods 30-36) average \u224824.9 units/week versus the earlier high regime. On-hand = 743, in-transit = 0; with large on-hand inventory we should reduce forecast window to recent data to avoid over-ordering. Use promised/confirmed lead time (4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current low-demand regime and lower volatility, helping the OR backend lower target base-stock and cap orders to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand = 742, in-transit = 0. Historical lead times repeatedly observed = 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, and many subsequent arrivals), so promised lead time remains appropriate. Recent weekly demand (Periods 30\u201337) has been low and stable (70,33,25,25,10,5,6,1); I use a recent_N forecast to focus the mu_hat and sigma_hat on this low-demand regime (N=8) so the OR backend reduces replenishment and holding cost while preserving service. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes to record.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=740, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time repeatedly 4 periods and large summer spike (Period 21+) but demand over the last 9 periods (P30-38) collapsed back to low levels. To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each), I bias forecasts to recent low-demand regime. I keep L=default (promised 4, matches observed conclusions) and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 9-week demand pattern, so the OR engine will size base stock to current low-demand regime and limit new receipts that would increase holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=740, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple confirmations P1->P5 etc.), so use observed lead time. Recent demand has fallen sharply since ~Period 30; to capture current low-demand regime I use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility (covers Periods 30-39). These parameters bias the OR backend toward much lower target stocking (reducing holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand dropped from ~186.25 (Periods 20-23) to 17.7 (Periods 30-39), a ~-90% decrease; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed orders: e.g., P1->P5, P2->P6, P7->P11, etc.).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=727, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (periods 30\u201340 mean \u224817.3 units/week). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. To avoid overstocking given high holding cost = profit, I keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecasts on the recent low-demand regime using the last 11 samples (Periods 30\u201340) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and matching std over the relevant horizon.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=666, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations). Demand has a sustained low regime since Period 30 (periods 30\u201341 show low weekly demand vs. earlier high spike). I set L using promised/default (4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint low-demand regime to avoid inflating mu_hat with earlier high-demand weeks: recent_N N=12 (Periods 30\u201341). Sigma is estimated over the same recent window (recent_N N=12) to capture current low volatility. These choices produce a base_stock focused on the current low-demand regime and limit new receipts (we already hold high on-hand), balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=287, in-transit=0. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand is volatile (large spike in Period 42 = 379) but not a sustained regime change over 3+ periods. To be conservative and let the OR engine use full historical demand stats with promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids overfitting to the single large recent spike while keeping service-level computation aligned with observed lead time evidence.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand shows a sharp holiday spike (Periods 39-43 demands = [0,13,61,379,3]) and confirmed lead time=4 in history. On-hand=284, in-transit=141 (pipeline=425). To capture the recent regime (holiday volatility) I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std (covers the last 5 observations including the big spike) and keep lead time as default (promised=4, consistent with observed confirmations). This biases mu_hat upward to cover short-term holiday demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability; with profit=holding cost the backend will set base_stock around the (1+L)-scaled recent mean balancing stockouts vs holding during the peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history: lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods; demand has large historical variability with no new 3+ period sustained shift (recent spike at P42 is single-period). Current on-hand=273, in-transit=172 \u2014 pipeline adequate for near-term demand. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats (no convincing changepoint). Methods chosen: L=default to keep using promised L=4; mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to use population volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use full historical mean/variance) while avoiding overreacting to a single-week spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history shows a large demand regime earlier in summer then a sharp drop to low steady demand in Sept\u2013Dec, and multiple concluded orders consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=265, in-transit=172 (pipeline substantial vs low recent demand). No evidence of new lost shipments. To be conservative and consistent with concluded lead-time observations and long history, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample history). This balances service (profit=holding cost) and avoids overreacting to short recent fluctuations given inventory on hand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. On-hand=260, in-transit=172. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations through Periods 5,6,26-34, etc.). Recent demand regime is lower than early-year peaks but has high volatility (notably Period 42 spike=379). To avoid stocking to outdated high-demand mean while capturing recent behavior, I use a recent-N demand estimate (last 12 weeks) which smooths the large spike but remains responsive. L set by calculated observed lead times (confirmed =4). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=12 to target (1+L)*recent_mean (~5*41.17\u2248205.8). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility including the large outlier. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given current variability) against holding cost with conservative, recent-driven forecasts.
