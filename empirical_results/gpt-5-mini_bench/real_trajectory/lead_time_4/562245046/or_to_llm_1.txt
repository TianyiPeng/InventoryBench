{
  "rationale": "Review of facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=1380. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed earlier consistently arrived after 4 periods), so promised lead time is confirmed. Recent demand has been high (Nov\u2013Dec spikes) and a prior sustained regime shift was already recorded (Period 6 insight). OR recommends 191 using promised L and historical demand; that recommendation ignores the large existing pipeline. Risk/benefit: each additional unit sold yields $4 profit but holding costs $1 per unit per period; with 1380 units already in transit we will hold substantial inventory if we order more now. Given confirmed L=4, the pipeline will materialize on schedule and should cover upcoming demand for multiple periods, so incremental ordering now mainly increases holding cost without materially increasing sales. Therefore order 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost and let the in-transit inventory fulfill demand. Monitor arrivals in subsequent conclude messages and resume ordering only when pipeline + on-hand approaches (L+1)-period expected demand or if we observe lost shipments or a further sustained demand increase.",
