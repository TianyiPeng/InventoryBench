Recent two large weeks (104, 111 in Periods 22\u201323) appear as transient spikes rather than a new sustained regime (only 2 high weeks following many low weeks). OR uses promised L=4 and historical data to compute a base-stock; its recommendation = 126 units (capped policy).\nRisk trade-offs: Profit = $4, holding cost = $1 (q=0.8 -> OR rightly biases safety stock). However, with confirmed long lead time (4) and zero in-transit, ordering large quantity risks substantial holding cost if recent spikes are not sustained. Given evidence of a prior sustained downshift (periods showing much lower weekly demand) and only two recent high weeks, I prefer to hedge rather than fully follow OR.\nOrder decision logic: I target moderate replenishment so on-hand + arriving in 4 periods covers moderate demand without creating large excess inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). Orders placed on Period 43 (600 units) will arrive during Period 47 arrival resolution (visible in Period 48). Inventory picture at decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=600. Demand context: recent weeks showed a holiday surge (Periods 41\u201344) but that is already captured in carry-over insights and appears to be ending (Periods 45\u201346 lower/variable). With promised/confirmed L=4 we must cover current + next 4 periods; pipeline=600 implies ample coverage versus recent weekly demands (e.g., 87,83,115,32). Ordering additional units now would incur unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $4; OR recommends 0 and its policy is conservative here. Action: place 0 units to avoid excess holding cost and rely on the in-transit 600 arrival to satisfy upcoming demand and to be re-evaluated next period once arrival is concluded.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Do not order: 600 units are already in-transit (arriving this period) and will cover upcoming demand; ordering now would create unnecessary holding cost after the holiday spike.",
