Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so required order = 5 * 70 - 0 = 350 units. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit; this order balances service level for the pipeline against holding cost given lead time uncertainty.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, variable holiday demand). Demand analysis: Recent periods show elevated and volatile demand (P41\u2013P46 = 135,308,87,83,115,32) but no new sustained regime change since prior carry-over. Lead time & pipeline: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals). In-transit = 770 (orders from P43=300 and P45=470) will arrive during Period 47 and can satisfy Period 47 demand (arrivals occur after decision but before demand). Inventory decision: Need to cover L+1 = 5 future periods of demand. Conservative forecast ~100 units/period given recent volatility \u2192 ~500 units required. Because 770 units are already in-transit (>= required coverage), placing additional order now would increase holding cost without improving service. Final action: place no new order.",
