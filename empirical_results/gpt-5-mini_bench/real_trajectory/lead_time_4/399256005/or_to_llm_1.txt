Demand analysis: recent 7-period average demand (P39\u2013P45) \u2248 66 units/week; this aligns with the carry-over insight that demand declined to ~62\u201366 after the earlier high regime. Coverage target: must cover current period + L future periods = 5 periods. 5 \xd7 66 \u2248 330 units required. Order decision: required \u2212 pipeline = 330 \u2212 283 = 47 units. No extra safety stock added because profit = holding cost implies critical fractile q=0.5 (z*\u22480). OR recommended 285 units but that uses older high-demand history and promised lead-time assumptions; given observed lower recent demand and substantial pipeline, I reduce the order to avoid excess holding cost. Final action: order 47 units for SKU 399256005.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed = 4 periods (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=57, in-transit=257 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=314. Demand outlook: recent periods (P41\u2013P46) average \u224860/wk but includes one large spike (P42=169); excluding spike recent baseline \u224838\u201360. Requirement: order + pipeline + on-hand should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using conservative 5-period demand = 5\xd760=300 (or 5\xd740=200 if spike excluded). Current pipeline+on-hand (314) already \u2265300, so additional ordering would increase holding cost without improving expected sales. OR recommended 284 based on longer-term history and promised L, but given confirmed L=4 and substantial pipeline, I reduce to 0. Action: place 0 units to avoid excess holding cost while covering the next 5 periods of demand.",
