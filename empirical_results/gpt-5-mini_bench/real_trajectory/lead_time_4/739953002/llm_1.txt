Lead time & pipeline: actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods repeatedly (arrivals correspond to orders placed 4 periods earlier). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=695 units which will arrive per the 4-period lead time (will cover many future weeks: 695 / 50\u224813.9 weeks at conservative demand). Holding vs profit: profit=$4/unit, holding=$1/unit/period \u2014 holding is meaningful if we overstock. Decision logic: given a large in-transit position that already \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 covers expected post-holiday demand and confirmed LT=4, do not place additional orders to avoid unnecessary holding cost and risk of overstock. Action: order 0 this period.",
