Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a sweater (seasonally relevant in winter). No on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time unknown\u2014use promised lead time. Historical sample mean = 90 units/week (5 samples). With promised L=4, set demand across review+lead to default rule ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to reflect historical std scaling. This provides the OR engine its standard base-stock forecast while avoiding premature adjustments given no arrival/lead-time evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=219 (ordered Period 1). Promised lead time is 4; absence of arrivals in Period 1 conclude is expected (arrivals occur during Periods >= N+1). Historical weekly demand samples mean=90 units (samples: 229,49,68,62,42). No sustained changepoint detected. Use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given current pipeline while avoiding premature adjustments for potentially delayed arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (orders placed in P1/P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals observed yet, so no evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use default L (promised) so backend assumes 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the full historical samples (stable but limited). This keeps orders driven by long-run sample mean while avoiding premature adjustments for unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand over the last 3 concluded periods (P1-P3: 36,55,48; avg=46.33) is substantially below the longer-run sample mean (historical samples avg=90). In-transit (610) matches prior orders (219+202+189) and no arrivals have concluded yet, so no evidence to override promised lead time. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4). To capture the recent lower-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (using the three most recent demand observations) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing order targets versus long-run averages and avoiding excess holding. This balances service level against holding cost given current low demand and substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in Periods 1-3 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25): recent avg demand=46.33 vs historical avg=90 (\u221248.5%); sustained for 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=610 (orders from P1-P3 still not concluded but not yet overdue given promised L=4). Historical samples show a sustained lower-demand regime in the most recent 3 concluded periods (demands 36,55,48 with P4 demand=31 reinforcing lower demand). To be conservative and responsive, keep lead time at promised (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to current lower demand while capping orders via its cap. This reduces holding cost risk given large in-transit and confirmed lower demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Observed confirmed lead time = 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5). On-hand 196 + in-transit 391 = 587 units. Given confirmed LT and no strong new sustained demand regime beyond prior insight, use calculated lead time (from observed LT=4) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples). This keeps parameters aligned with historical data while accounting for the confirmed lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-25 (Period 7). Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Recent demand has fallen and remained low: last 3 demands = [31,23,20] (mean=24.67); full recent history P1-P6 mean=35.5 vs historical mean=90. On-hand=378 + in-transit=189 covers several periods, so target stocking should reflect the new lower demand regime while keeping lead time at 4. Set L by calculating observed lead times; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent Periods 1-6 (2019-02-11 to 2019-03-18) avg demand=35.5 vs historical avg=90 (\u221260.6%); sustained low demand in last 3 periods (avg=24.67).; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 5-7) is low and stable (23,20,21). To reflect confirmed LT and the recent low-demand regime I set L=calculate (use observed avg LT=4) and base demand estimates on the most recent 3 periods: mu_hat recent_N N=3 and sigma_hat recent_N N=3. This reduces forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to avoid unnecessary ordering given large on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=526, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Demand has shown a sustained downward regime vs long-run history; use recent demand to set forecast. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained low-demand regime (periods 1\u20136 recent avg). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility rather than historical variance. These choices reduce ordering to match lower demand while respecting actual lead time and limiting holding cost.

To be responsive to the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility. I keep L at default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals confirm L=4. This reduces future overstocking while preserving service given current low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=474, in-transit=0. Historical pre-game samples mean=90 but recent selling history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (recent periods averaging well below historical). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). To reflect the confirmed LT=4 and the sustained demand drop, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using recent data (recent_N=6) to capture the low-demand regime while avoiding overstock. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a lower base-stock appropriate for the new regime and limit excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). History shows confirmed lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Demand has been in a sustained lower regime vs historical (carry-over notes avg ~35.5 over recent 6 periods). On-hand is high (343) with no in-transit. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L to calculated (reflect confirmed observed lead time) and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the low-demand regime (uses most recent 6 samples per carry-over). This biases orders downward versus historical averages and limits holding cost exposure while maintaining service for the current lower-demand environment.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=164, in-transit=26. Historical data and concluded messages confirm actual lead time=4 and a prior sustained low-demand regime through Period 7, but Periods 11-12 show two large spikes (131,179) \u2014 not yet a 3-period sustained shift. To avoid overreacting to two high-demand weeks and given high service-level target (profit $19 vs holding $1), use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend's base-stock calculation smooths recent noise while protecting service levels. This balances stockouts risk from possible continued high demand vs holding costs on current sizable inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=94, in-transit=189. Historical concluded lead times (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) are all 4 periods \u2014 use recent average. Demand showed a prolonged low regime through Period 10 (carry-over) but the last 3 concluded periods (P11\u2013P13: 131, 179, 70) represent a clear, sustained high-demand spike; to capture current demand risk I forecast using the most recent 3 periods. Therefore: L use recent_N (N=3) to anchor lead time at observed 4; mu_hat use recent_N (N=3) to let the backend compute (1+L)*mean of last 3 demands (reflecting the recent spike); sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base stock to protect service during the new higher-demand regime while the capped order constraint limits extreme ordering and holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 11-13 (2019-04-22 to 2019-05-06): avg demand=126.67 vs prior recent avg=35.5 (+257%); sustained for 3 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand jump in Periods 11-13 (avg 126.67) was sustained for 3 periods; demand in Periods 12-14: 179,70,50 shows elevated volatility. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. On-hand=44, in-transit=406 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand currently sizable versus short-term demand, but recent spike justifies using the short recent regime to size review+lead demand and variability. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the 3-period high-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods; this balances service during the spike against holding cost given large pipeline.

Recent demand has been volatile: Periods 13-15 demands = [70, 50, 21], showing a drop after the April spike. To reflect the most recent regime and avoid excess holding given large pipeline, set L by calculation of observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last 3 demand samples) so the backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on the latest lower demand regime and reduces overstock risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=25, in-transit=594. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P12\u2192P16). Demand regimes: earlier low-demand regime (Periods 1-6) and a spike in Periods 11-13 are recorded. Recent 3 periods (Periods 14-16) show lower demand again (50,21,24; avg\u224831.67), suggesting current short-run demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent regime (Periods 14-16), keeping safety stock aligned to current lower demand and avoiding excess holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). History shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current on-hand=180 and in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Demand has been volatile: earlier spike in Periods 11-13 (avg 126.7) then a drop; last 3 periods (15-17) show low demand (21,24,8) but volatility remains. To balance service vs holding cost given high pipeline and recent downward demand signal, keep promised lead time (default) and use an EWMA for mu_hat to emphasize recent lower demand while still accounting for earlier spike (gamma=0.5). Use default sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This reduces future order targets while allowing backend cap to limit single-period orders, lowering holding cost risk given large in-transit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P12\u2192P16, P13\u2192P17, P14\u2192P18). Recent demand has fallen sharply in the last 3 periods (Period 16-18 demands = 24, 8, 5; recent avg \u224812.33). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L by observed average lead time (calculate). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current low-demand regime (the OR backend will scale for (1+L)). This reduces order quantity vs. historical higher-demand periods and limits holding cost given large on-hand inventory and in-transit stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized after the May spike: last 3 demands = [8,5,4] (Periods 17-19) avg=5.67. On-hand=602, in-transit=0 so no urgent ordering needed. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To avoid overstock given high on-hand, set demand forecast using recent 3-period regime: mu_hat recent_N (N=3) captures the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current low volatility. This reduces target base stock and limits new receipts while the large on-hand buffer depletes, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=601, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded P1\u2192P5 ... P15\u2192P19), so I set L to the calculated average (4). Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 5 periods demands = [24,8,5,4,1], avg\u22488.4, much lower than the prior spike (Periods 11-13 avg=126.67). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 periods (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock reflective of current low demand and reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 16-20: avg demand=8.4 vs prior recent avg=126.67 (\u221293.3%); sustained for 5 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been in a low regime (carry-over shows sustained drops through Period 21). On-hand=597, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory today, no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been empirically 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirms) so set L to be estimated from observations to keep aligned with evidence. Demand forecast scaled to the most recent short window to reflect the persistent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This reduces target base-stock relative to historical means while acknowledging observed variability.

Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime across Periods 16\u201322 (demands: 24, 8, 5, 4, 1, 4, 0) so I use recent data to avoid overforecasting. Set L to calculated (observed avg = 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7-period low-demand regime) so the OR backend targets lower base stock and reduces holding costs while preserving service for current demand pattern.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=583, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected this period (next visible arrivals would show in conclude). Recent demand has been very low (Periods 20-24 demands = [1,4,0,2,12], avg \u22483.8), so hold minimal replenishment. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; use default promised LT. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (last 5 periods) so the OR backend sets a much lower base-stock and avoids excess holding costs given large on-hand stock and holding cost sensitivity (profit=$19, holding=$1).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=563, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325) has been very low (4,0,2,12,20) compared with earlier regimes; no new sustained upward regime change is proven. Given very high on-hand stock relative to recent demand, I choose L by calculation (confirming observed lead time=4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the replenishment target on the most recent low-demand regime and low variability, avoiding unnecessary orders and holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=541, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs. recent low summer demand. Historical confirmed lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly P1\u2192P5 etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand regime remains the low-summer pattern (Periods 20-26 demand series = [1,4,0,2,12,20,22], recent mean \u22488.71). To avoid overstocking, forecast demand using a recent-window estimate: set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods to reflect the sustained low-demand regime; this keeps base stock low and reduces holding costs while preserving service. No new missing shipments detected.

Observed lead times consistently 4 periods (use calculate). To avoid overstocking, set mu_hat based on the most recent short-run regime (recent_N N=3) so the OR backend targets lower replenishment; set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent low volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=478, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory so no urgent replenishment. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=4; use calculated lead time. Demand has had multiple regime shifts; recent demand (last 5 periods) is more representative for near-term forecast, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current lower-but-rising weekly demand. These parameters keep target base-stock aligned with recent demand while the OR cap limits order size and avoids overstocking given high on-hand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=438, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible recently and past concluded orders show consistent lead_time=4. Recent demand has risen from prior trough: last 6 periods (P24\u2013P29) demands = [12,20,22,36,27,40], suggesting a new higher-short-run mean. To capture the confirmed lead time and focus forecast on the recent regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (covers the recent regime while meeting the 3+ period sustained requirement). This balances service (avoid stockouts as demand has increased) versus holding cost given large on-hand inventory by using a short recent-sample forecast rather than the long-run high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 24-29: avg demand=26.17 vs prior recent avg=8.4 (+211%); sustained for 6 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=266, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Recent demand regime: elevated but volatile from Periods 24-30 (regime length ~6 weeks, avg ~26.17 before a single large spike at Period 30). To respect confirmed lead time I let the backend compute L from observed lead-times. To keep the forecast responsive to the most recent sustained regime, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the latest 6-week demand pattern while avoiding overreacting to the single extreme spike. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current on-hand) and holding cost by tying parameters to recent regime evidence.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has spiked (Periods 30-31: 172, 186) after a long low-demand run; on-hand=80, in-transit=150 (total pipeline=230). Promised lead time was 4 and past concluded arrivals confirm L=4. To respond to the recent upward regime, I bias forecasts to the most recent weeks: use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high mean and elevated volatility observed in Periods 29-31 (40,172,186). Keeping L=default (promised) keeps pipeline timing aligned with supplier promise while mu/sigma recent_N tightens service-level targeting to avoid stockouts during this spike and limit excess holding if the spike subsides.

Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=416. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand has jumped in the last 3 periods (P30-P32: 172,186,234) indicating a new high-demand regime. To protect service while avoiding excessive holding, keep L as promised (4) and set demand forecast and volatility based on the most recent 3-period regime to capture the current spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30-32 (2019-09-02 to 2019-09-16): avg demand=197.33 vs prior recent avg=26.17 (+656%); sustained for 3 periods.

Historical observed lead time=4 (confirmed earlier). To respond to the recent high-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time, keep L as promised (default) and set demand forecast using recent data: use the last 3 periods to capture the spike (mu_hat recent_N N=3). Use recent volatility (sigma_hat recent_N N=3) so the OR backend raises base-stock and cap appropriately to balance service vs holding cost given high profit vs low holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=1065. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 4-period arrivals (multiple P1\u2192P5 etc.). Recent demand history shows several regime shifts earlier, but no new sustained change in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 32-34 show very high demand spikes followed by stockouts). Given confirmed lead time=4 and substantial pipeline inventory (1065), use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its long-run sample statistics and caps. This avoids overreacting to the recent volatile spikes while pipeline stock arrives. No evidence of lost shipments in recent concluded messages.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=915 (orders from Periods 32-34 will arrive during Period 36). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has spiked since Period 30 (Period 30-35 demands = [172,186,234,352,222,167], recent avg \u2248 222), so I use a recent-N forecast to capture the new high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised = 4, confirmed by arrivals). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covers the six-period high-demand regime) so the OR engine targets a base stock that meets the elevated (1+L)-period demand while sigma reflects recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 30: demands P30\u2013P36 = [172,186,234,352,222,167,132], 7-period avg = 209.29, sustained >3 periods. Observed lead time repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded messages (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=134, in-transit=985 (total pipeline=1,119) \u2014 pipeline is large but recent demand regime is high, so base stock should reflect recent high demand. Therefore: L = default (use promised lead time 4, which matches observed arrivals); mu_hat = recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime over the last 7 weeks (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples); sigma_hat = recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture current high mean) versus holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run historical low-demand periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent history shows consistent observed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5 etc.). On-hand=265 + in-transit=926 = 1,191 units \u2014 ample pipeline relative to recent high weekly demands, so avoid boosting forecast. Use lead time estimate from observations and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps orders conservative given large pipeline and high holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime from Periods 33\u201338 (demands: 352,222,167,132,120,165) \u2014 average \u2248193 units \u2014 materially above prior regimes. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods historically; use promised/default lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (the six most recent demand observations) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current high regime. Current on-hand (498) + in-transit (528) is ample but given high recent demand I prefer recent-based estimates to avoid understocking while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 33-38: avg demand=193.0 vs prior recent avg=26.17 (+636%), sustained for 6 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Recent history shows large swings (sustained high demand in Periods 33-38) but current on-hand (448) + in-transit (782) = 1,230 units provides substantial coverage for the (L+1) review window. Profit/holding ratio strongly favors service (q\u22480.95) but existing pipeline is ample, so use default demand/volatility estimates and promised lead time to let the OR engine compute a conservative base-stock and apply its cap. No new sustained changepoint detected that would justify deviating from defaults.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=733, in-transit=446 (total pipeline=1179) \u2014 ample inventory relative to recent demand. Historical data shows multiple prior regime shifts; actual lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (consistent with promised lead time). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (4). Recent demand (Periods 35-40 = 167,132,120,165,50,51) better reflects the post-spike mix of high early-Oct sales and more moderate Nov sales; to capture this short-term regime I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 6 samples. This keeps the forecast responsive while acknowledging confirmed L=4 and current large on-hand/pipeline, helping the OR engine avoid unnecessary additional orders and reduce holding cost.

On-hand=878, in-transit=254 \u2192 pipeline=1132, which comfortably covers expected demand; recent history shows stable confirmed lead time=4 periods (multiple concluded P->P+4 arrivals). To avoid unnecessary replenishment given high inventory, keep demand parameters at population defaults while using observed lead-time: set L by calculation (avg observed lead times = 4). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat prevents overreacting to recent spikes and lets the OR backend compute base_stock consistent with long-run samples.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand recovered from very low summer into strong Sept/Oct peaks and moderate Nov (last 4 demand = 50,51,47,74; recent mean ~55). On-hand=804 + in-transit=254 => pipeline=1058 units which is ample versus typical weekly demand; no recently missing shipments. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) implying a high service-level objective, use the backend defaults that incorporate all historical samples while trusting observed lead time. This keeps target base-stock high to avoid stockouts during potential holiday season while relying on the OR engine caps to limit excessive ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=1029, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) has moderated relative to earlier peaks. To avoid increasing an already-large on-hand position and to reflect the most recent demand regime, set lead time estimate from observations and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods (reduces order targets vs. long-run mean). Volatility also computed from the same recent window so the backend caps orders appropriately.

Demand last 6 concluded periods (P39-P44) average ~50 units/week, lower than earlier seasonal peaks; no new sustained regime shift detected. Given large on-hand inventory, use a short recent demand window to avoid overordering: set L by calculating observed lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect current lower demand and recent volatility. This keeps base_stock conservative to reduce holding cost while preserving service given observed lead_time=4.

Recent demand (Periods 43-45) = [29,49,37], recent mean \u224838.3; demand appears moderate after prior spikes. I keep L as promised (default=4) since lead time is confirmed. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures current moderate demand). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. With high on-hand and no pipeline, these parameters will lead the OR engine to likely order little or none, balancing service level vs holding cost.
