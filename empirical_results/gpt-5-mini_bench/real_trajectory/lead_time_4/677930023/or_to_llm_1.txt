These four consistent low weeks suggest a downward regime vs. OR's full-history mean (90). Risk tradeoff: profit/holding gives high critical fractile (q=0.95) which justifies service, but evidence of sustained lower demand (4 consecutive lower periods) argues reducing order to avoid excess holding over the multi-period lead time.

However the most recent 4 samples (2019-01-14 to 2019-02-04) average = (49+68+62+42)/4 = 55.25, a sustained lower regime vs the early outlier 229.

Decision logic: with 488 on-hand I already cover ~10 weeks at current run-rate and ~20 weeks at post-spike lower rates; ordering now only increases holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit per unit ($19) only materializes if sold sooner. No evidence of an imminent multi-week surge that would consume >488+new before orders with LT=4 arrive. Therefore do not order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and potential overstock.
