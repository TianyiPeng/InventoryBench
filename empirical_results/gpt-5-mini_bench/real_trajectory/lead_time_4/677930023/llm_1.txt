Demand analysis: historical on-sales when stocked show typical weekly demand ~20\u201340, but recent stockouts produced large observed demands (131,179,70,50) that likely reflect latent demand rather than new sustained regime.

Additional ordering now would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit per unit is $19, so avoid overstock given uncertainty of sustained high demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 = 2019-12-23, one week before Christmas \u2014 sweaters are seasonally relevant and demand can spike. Demand regime/history: recent weeks (P39\u2013P45) settled near ~49/week with a one-off 74 (P42) and recent 29,49,37. Lead time: confirmed 4 periods from history (multiple P arrivals P+4). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=665, in-transit=0. At an expected demand of ~50/week this on-hand covers ~13 weeks; even a holiday spike (e.g., doubling for a few weeks) leaves substantial cover. Cost tradeoff: profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period strongly favors having stock to avoid lost sales, but current on-hand is already ample. Ordering now would arrive in Period 50 (after 4-period lead) \u2014 too late to affect immediate holiday demand and would increase multi-period holding cost. Final order logic: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding while maintaining excellent service with existing inventory.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (week of New Year). Small transient holiday effects possible but recent weeks (P39\u2013P46) show no extreme spike; treat demand near current regime. Product: sweater \u2014 seasonal for winter but existing demand already reflects season. b) Demand regime: Recent demands P39\u2013P46 = 50,51,47,74,29,49,37,35 \u2192 recent average \u224848/week; no new sustained regime shift. c) Lead time / orders: Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no in-transit stock and no overdue shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 630, in-transit = 0. With weekly demand \u224848, current on-hand covers \u224813 weeks of demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period \u2192 current period holding cost = $630. Marginal value of additional units is negative because they incur holding cost before generating profit. e) Order decision: Do not place new orders this period to avoid increasing holding costs and risking lower net reward; allow inventory to deplete toward target cover (~4\u20136 weeks).",
