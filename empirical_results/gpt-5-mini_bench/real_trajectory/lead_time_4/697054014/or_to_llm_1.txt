OR's uncapped base-stock \u2248569 but cap calculation reduces the recommended order to ~132 (matches OR=133). Lead time / arrivals: no concluded-period messages yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed; treat promised L=4 as possible. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand if shipments arrive as promised. Demand outlook: recent five-week sequence is steadily falling (most recent week 80, ~19% below mean), and product is a seasonal womens blouse with no imminent holiday in mid-February to drive upside. Risk tradeoff: holding cost is low ($1) but critical fractile is already high (0.95) making OR very conservative. Given clear recent downward drift and no evidence yet that lead time is shorter than promised, I reduce OR's capped recommendation modestly to avoid excess holding while still covering multi-week demand and safety. Final action: order 100 units (below OR's 133) \u2014 still provides ~1.0\xd7 single-period mean coverage and a conservative buffer across the lead time without accumulating large excess inventory.",
