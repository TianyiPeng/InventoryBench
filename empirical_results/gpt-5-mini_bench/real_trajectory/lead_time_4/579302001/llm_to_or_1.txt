Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical weekly samples (96,105,130,150,58) give mean \u2248107.8; demand context shows no sustained regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand stats so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/std and promised L=4, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

On-hand=0, in-transit=166 (order from P1 has not concluded \u2192 cannot infer actual lead time yet; could be on-time given promised L=4).

Recent conclude messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132, but promised lead time is 4 and those orders would not be expected to conclude yet\u2014insufficient evidence to infer a lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use defaults: rely on full-sample demand stats and promised lead time so the backend computes base stock and cap using historical samples.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen vs Jan samples (concluded demands: 28, 48, 60) indicating a lower recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=440 but no arrivals in Periods 1\u20133 (orders placed in P1\u2013P3 all arrived=0) \u2014 sustained overdue shipments likely indicating lost/delayed supply. To protect service while accounting for delayed arrivals I explicitly increase lead time and base forecasts on the most recent 3 demand observations. Choices: L explicit=6 to reflect observed delays beyond promised 4; mu_hat recent_N N=3 to base (1+L)-period demand on the latest low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This raises required pipeline cover for the longer effective lead time while keeping forecasts responsive to the recent downward demand, balancing profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding rates.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all show arrived=0 despite promised L=4; in-transit=440 but no concludes over 3 periods \u2192 possible lost/delayed shipments

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent realized demand (history samples) averages ~107.8/week (samples: 96,105,130,150,58). On-hand=0, in-transit=440 but no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (P1 ordered166, P2 ordered169, P3 ordered105) and Period 4 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 indicating shipments delayed or lost. Promised lead time=4, but shipments have not concluded for >3 periods; to protect service level I lengthen assumed lead time to cover extended delays and use population-wide demand stats (no confirmed demand regime change). Therefore: set L explicitly longer (explicit L=8) to make mu_hat = default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the backend stocks for 9 periods of expected demand, and keep sigma_hat default to reflect sample volatility. This increases safety stock to mitigate missing arrivals while accepting higher holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments confirmed: orders placed P1\u2013P3 (166,169,105) show arrived=0 across Periods 2\u20134 despite promised L=4; in-transit=440 with no concludes over 3 periods \u2192 likely lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concludes show an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, so actual lead time is consistent with promised L=4. Historical demand samples (weeks in history) have mean 107.8 units/week; with review+lead horizon (1+L)=5 this implies (default) mu_hat = 5\xd7mean. No sustained demand regime shift detected. There were earlier signs of missing/delayed shipments for P2\u2013P3 but a P1 arrival confirms lead time=4 rather than persistent loss; therefore use lead-time inference (calculate) and default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overreaction to transient delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1/P2 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=169, in-transit=258 => pipeline_total=427 which is below a 5-period demand bulk (historical mean ~108\xd75\u2248540), so we should keep forecasts anchored to historical sample mean but respect confirmed LT. Set L by calculating observed lead times; use default mu/sigma (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service level (capture demand over review+lead window) vs holding cost conservatively given delayed shipments history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=177 + in-transit=155 = 332 units; demand history (samples: 96,105,130,150,58) has mean=107.8. Using confirmed L=4 and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) yields mu_hat that captures the 5-period demand horizon; default sigma captures observed variability. With on-hand+pipeline < (1+L)\xd7mean, the policy will place replenishment to restore the base-stock while the cap limits excess ordering, balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Historical demand mean = 107.8 w/ samples [96,105,130,150,58]. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Current on-hand=86, in-transit=256 (pipeline=342) so supply covers several periods. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead times and default demand stats (no sustained demand regime change detected). This balances service (use observed lead time) against holding cost by relying on full-sample mean/variance rather than up-weighting recent noise.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1\u2013P5 arrivals with W=4). Historical weekly demand samples mean=107.8 (N=5); current on-hand=171 + in-transit=196 = 367 units. To cover review+lead (1+L=5) periods and keep service while avoiding extra holding (profit and holding cost equal $1), use promised lead time and historical demand statistics. I select default L to trust the confirmed promised lead time, default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the 5-period demand forecast, and default sigma_hat to scale observed volatility for the 5-period horizon. This balances service level versus holding cost given current inventory coverage and no new sustained regime shift.

Pipeline looks healthy but arrivals have lagged historically; use observed lead time. Demand recent regime lower than early samples \u2014 use recent data. Set L by calculating average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 6\u201310) to capture the current demand regime ((1+L) coverage).

Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and earlier delayed shipments have since arrived, so I will trust the promised lead time and historical demand seed. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (using full historical mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=74, in-transit=227. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show observed lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12). Earlier missing-arrival episodes resolved into a consistent LT=4. I set L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (which is 4) so the policy reflects confirmed reality rather than the promise. Demand mean/volatility will use all available samples (default) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture long-run demand signal; this avoids overreacting to short fluctuations while balancing service level (profit=holding cost) against inventory holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.), so set L based on observed lead times. Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies the established base-stock formula using full history.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=361. Historical conclude messages show consistent 4-period arrival lags (orders placed observed arriving after 4 periods), so actual lead time is confirmed as 4. No sustained demand regime shift detected in available samples; recent demand variability is within historical variability. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and historical demand, I select L by calculating average observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use default aggregations so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This leverages the confirmed lead time and stable demand history while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P13 arriving after 4 periods). Recent demand has trended up (notably demands: P13\u2013P17 = 100,104,66,139,191). To capture the recent regime while relying on observed lead-time behavior, set L by calculation (average of observed lead times = 4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples P13\u2013P17) so mu_hat reflects the upward shift; similarly use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (e.g., order on Period 1 arrived Period 5; repeated P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.). Demand regime shift starting Period 13: recent avg (P13\u2013P17)=120 vs earlier sample mean\u2248108 (+11%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=413. Recent history shows lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirms) and a sustained demand uptick starting Period 13 (recent avg higher). Pipeline (413) covers some upcoming demand but arrivals are observed with 1-period observation lag. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time data (will confirm 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (periods P13\u2013P17 regime) to capture the higher recent mean when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect service level during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping variability grounded in the recent sample, mitigating stockouts given the long lead time and past delayed arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=506. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders consistently arrive after 4 periods). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 13 (sustained higher weekly demand through P19). To focus the forecast on the recent higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 demand samples (captures P13\u2013P19 pattern while providing some smoothing). Using L=default (promised lead time=4) keeps the backend aligned with observed/confirmed lead time. The recent_N choice raises target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_recent increases safety stock to preserve service without excessive holding given holding cost=profit. On-hand + in-transit (506) will be reconciled by the backend pipeline; my parameters ensure orders cover (1+L) periods of recent demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand elevated vs earlier sample: last 5 observed demands (Periods 16\u201320) = [139,191,129,139,108], average \u2248141.2, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 13. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=584 (pipeline large). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine account for promised lead time and large pipeline, I choose L=default (use promised L=4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent elevated regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while the pipeline arrival will reduce immediate ordering pressure and limit holding costs.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=636. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand regime increased starting Period 13 and has persisted through Period 21 (higher weekly demand, frequent stockouts). I set L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 13\u201321) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; this weights recent elevated demand and reduces stockouts. For volatility I use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices ensure the OR backend raises base stock to meet the new regime while keeping cap limits to control holding cost; using recent samples also mitigates impact of earlier lower-demand periods and accounts for in-transit inventory and potential lost shipments.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 13; recent 5-period demand is elevated versus earlier mean. On-hand=48, in-transit=449 which covers multiple weeks but current on-hand is low versus recent demand spikes. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concludes, so use promised lead time. To respond to the sustained upward demand, set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 5 periods to capture the new regime; match sigma to recent volatility (last 5). These parameters push the OR backend to raise base stock to improve service while respecting the cap.

Pipeline + on-hand looks adequate but demand regime is higher; to adapt I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the new regime while keeping lead time at the promised value. I choose recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on Periods 13\u201323 data (N=11) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the higher sustained demand without overreacting to older lower-demand samples. L left as default (=promised) because concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 and there is no evidence of lost shipments currently.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been above historical mean since Period 13; last 5 concluded demands (P20\u2013P24) = [108,188,150,102,117], avg=133. On-hand=145, in-transit=382 (sufficient pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To be responsive to the higher recent demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and base the demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods (captures the sustained increase). This provides the OR backend with a higher target stock to protect service over the 5-period review+lead window while keeping variability estimates tied to the same recent window.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand has shown a sustained uptick starting Period 13 (P13\u2013P17 mean \u2248120 vs earlier mean \u2248108; +11%) so I bias forecasts to the recent higher regime. Current available = on-hand 196 + in-transit 398. Lead time history repeatedly confirms L=4; no new lead-time anomalies visible. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use P13\u2013P17-like recent window). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand regime elevated since Period 13; recent 5-period mean used to capture current pace. I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest 5-week demand (captures sustained shift while limiting older data). This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by updating forecast and variability from most recent regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weeks (Periods 23\u201327) show elevated demand (e.g., 102,117,71,114,196) and a sustained higher-demand regime noted from Period 13 (+~11% vs earlier). Current on-hand=89, in-transit=269 (pipeline adequate for coverage but on-hand lean). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the newer regime and capture recent mean/volatility; N=5 balances responsiveness and sample size given the detected changepoint at Period 13. These parameters will bias base-stock upward vs long-run mean to protect service under the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability to set safety stock appropriately, limiting stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand has been higher and more variable since the regime shift beginning Period 13; recent periods show large weekly demand (e.g., P25\u2013P28 demands = 71,114,196,168) so I bias forecasts toward the recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=409 \u2014 pipeline currently covers multiple weeks given L=4, but variability and sustained higher mean argue using recent data. Set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history consistently confirms a 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 13 onward (regime length ~16 periods), so the OR backend will size base-stock and cap using recent mean and volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=27, in-transit=468. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly), and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 13 (higher mean). I set L to be inferred from observations. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 13\u201329, 17 samples) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility. This raises base_stock to better cover (1+L) periods of demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability so the capped order cap prevents extreme single-period orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=584. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (recent demands elevated). Several shipments have arrived on promised cadence recently so use promised lead time. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime using the most recent 5 demands (Periods 26\u201330: 114,196,168,111,89). This focuses the OR base-stock on the current demand level while avoiding stale early-sample dilution. Keeping L=default (promised=4) aligns with observed confirmations and lets the backend compute (1+L)*mean; recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility. No new sustained pattern changes to record.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline is large but arrivals are observed with the promised 4-period lag. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and historical demand, use default L (promised lead time = 4) and default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overfitting to short-term noise while the pipeline clears; using defaults balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 13 (sustained +11% vs earlier). On-hand=360, in-transit=95 (no overdue/conclude anomalies recently); promised lead time=4 and historical concludes consistently show L=4. To capture the post-Period-13 regime, use recent_N over the most recent 20 demand samples for forecast and volatility while leaving L at default (promised=4). This raises base_stock to reflect higher sustained demand while sigma from recent data controls safety stock and the cap.

I choose the backend defaults so OR uses promised L and full-sample demand moments: L=default to reflect confirmed 4-period behavior; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) given no new sustained shift; sigma_hat=default to capture full-sample volatility. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has softened (last 6 demands = 62,95,66,55,37,39) but historical data and concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=284, in-transit=231 (no overdue/unconcluded shipments visible). Use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times = 4) so OR backend aligns with empirical arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a stable forecast given mixed recent softness and longer-run history; this balances service vs holding cost without overreacting to short transient drop.

No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint since prior insights. Given confirmed L=4 and no recent regime shift evidence, use default estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and corresponding std; this keeps policy aligned with observed lead time and avoids overfitting recent noise while letting backend cap orders vs. pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 36 (demands: P36=37, P37=39, P38=33, P39=33) vs prior regime (~100+). On-hand=313, in-transit=136 => pipeline=449, which already covers many weeks at current low demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L to default (use promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the new low-demand regime (N=4 from P36\u2013P39). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect reduced volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand and limit new receipts given large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36: recent avg (P36\u2013P39)=35 vs prior ~108 (\u221268%), sustained over 4 periods

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 36 (weekly demands P36\u2013P40 = 37,39,33,33,28 \u2192 avg \u224834). On-hand=421, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock relative to current low demand; no outstanding arrivals. Use promised lead time (default L=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L) forecast to the new low-demand regime (reduces ordering vs. historical higher mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so safety buffer reflects current lower volatility. This reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service given confirmed lower demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has fallen sharply starting Period 36 (weekly demand ~35) and has remained low through Period 41 (demand 37,39,33,33,28,29). On-hand = 392, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments visible. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, I bias forecasts to the new low-demand regime by using a recent-window forecast (captures the drop starting P36). L set to calculated (reflects observed lead time = 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 (periods 36\u201341) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using the low recent mean and volatility, reducing orders and holding costs while maintaining service for current low demand.

On-hand=324, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory vs. current low-demand regime. Use promised lead time (default L=4).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=226, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many P\u2192P+4 arrivals), and earlier episodes of delayed/missing shipments have resolved; no persistent new lead-time signal. Recent demand has variation but no new sustained regime of 3+ periods beyond previously recorded shifts. I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of demand samples, which balances profit vs. holding cost using the backend's service-level formula; this is conservative given current on-hand stock (226) and no in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=164. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly). Demand regime noted: sustained lower demand beginning Period 36 (Oct 14) \u2014 recent low-demand regime spans Periods 36\u201343 (regime length=8). To avoid overstocking given holding cost = profit, keep promised lead time and shrink demand forecast to the low-demand regime: L use default (promised = 4); mu_hat use recent_N over the last 8-period low-demand regime to reflect reduced mean demand; sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to capture current lower volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap orders to limit holding cost while preserving service for the observed low-demand regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (many P\u2192P+4 confirms). Recent demand has increased in the last 5 periods (Periods 41\u201345 = 29,68,98,232,176) reflecting a seasonal December spike. To capture the confirmed lead time and the recent seasonal demand regime, set L using observed lead times (calculate). Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the Dec spike; use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock tuned to current high-demand weeks while respecting the confirmed LT=4 and limiting excess inventory outside the spike window.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=603 (sum of P44\u2013P46 orders:164+185+254). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history; recent demand is volatile with a large holiday spike in Periods 44\u201346. To ensure pipeline covers the high recent demand (and because the OR engine multiplies (1+L) into mu_hat), I use the promised/confirmed lead time and a recent-N demand estimate focused on the last 5 periods (Periods 42\u201346) to capture the holiday surge while letting the backend compute safety stock. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect realized volatility. These choices aim to keep service during the holiday spike while avoiding excessive long-term overstock once demand normalizes.
