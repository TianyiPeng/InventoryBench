Inventory assessment: On-hand=0 so current-period demand will be unmet unless supply arrives during this period (arrivals occur after decision and will only be visible in next conclude). Forecast & ordering logic: Use conservative demand ~190 units/period for recent regime.

Decision rule: ensure on-hand + in-transit + new order covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Forecast: use recent regime but adjust for Christmas uplift; conservatively forecast 150 units/week for 5 weeks -> target coverage = 750. Shortfall = 750 - 632 = 118. Place order to cover shortfall while avoiding excessive holding cost (holding=$1, profit=$19). Order 120 units.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (week between Xmas and New Year). Recent historical spike at Period 42 (2019-11-25) aligns with Black Friday; treat that as event-driven spike, not ongoing baseline. Demand analysis: last 4 non-Black-Friday periods (P43\u2013P46) demands = [107,88,103,139], avg \u2248109 units/period. Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; in-transit = 653 units, on-hand = 0. Ordering decision timing: orders placed now would arrive in Period 51 (4 periods later) \u2014 after the immediate holiday week. Risk/reward: Given large in-transit quantity (653) which already covers ~5\u20136 periods at the recent baseline (~109*5=545), placing additional order would unnecessarily increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) with modest marginal profit benefit. Action: place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost while the pipeline clears.",
