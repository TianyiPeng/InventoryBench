OR baseline: recommends 194 units (their capped base-stock result). Given OR uses promised L and historical averages, its final order_raw would be ~194 \u2212 pipeline(149) = 45. Adjustment reasoning: Recent observed demand (195) is materially above OR's historical mean and OR's recommendation; with equal profit and holding cost q=0.5 the baseline underweights upside risk. Lead-time uncertainty and possibility of lost/delayed shipments argue for a cautious buffer because replenishment won't arrive for several periods. Action chosen: order 100 units (larger than OR's implied 45) to build a modest safety buffer if high demand persists or if additional in-transit units are delayed.

{
  "rationale": "Lead time confirmed = 4 (carry-over). Current on-hand = 71, in-transit = 201 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand = 272 units. Orders placed now would not arrive until Period 51 (4 periods), too late for the immediate holiday window (Date 2019-12-23). Recent demand has been moderate (~50\u201380/week) and previous carry-over regime shifts are already recorded; no new sustained signal. With profit = holding cost ($1/$1) the service-level fractile is 0.5 (no safety stock tilt). Given large pipeline, long lead time, and no expectation that an order placed now will improve near-term sales (and would incur holding cost equal to profit), I place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and potential overstock after the holiday.",

Required cover = 5 \xd7 expected weekly demand. Using a conservative expected demand = 59 \u2192 target inventory over next 5 periods = 295 units. Shortfall = 295 \u2212 231 = 64 units. OR recommended 153 (uses promised L and historical samples); I reduce to 64 because we already have large pipeline (181) and confirmed lead time (no losses). Ordering 64 balances service (\u22485\u2010week cover) while avoiding extra holding cost (holding cost = profit, so overstock is costly). Final decision: order 64 units.",
