  "rationale": "Date is 2019-02-11 (week). Product = ladies high-waist skinny ankle denim \u2014 not highly seasonal but core fashion item. Historical weekly demand shows a clear, recent upward regime: 2019-01-07:0, 01-14:0, 01-21:56, 01-28:216, 02-04:319. This is a sharp rising trend over the last three weeks; treat latest weeks as better predictors than the earlier zeros. No on-hand or in-transit stock and supplier promised lead time = 4 periods (so order placed now will arrive during Period 6 and be visible in Period 7). Because lead-time is long and there is no pipeline, we must decide now for demand several weeks ahead. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit = $1/unit; carrying excess inventory is costly and erodes profit. To balance service vs. holding, I forecast conservatively using the recent 3-week average demand = (56+216+319)/3 \u2248 197 units/week. Required coverage = (L+1)=5 periods \u2192 demand coverage \u2248 197\xd75 \u2248 985 units.

Orders placed in P28 (132) will arrive in P32; P29 (200) arrives in P33. Current state at decision (Period 30): on-hand = 0, in-transit = 332 (arrivals >1 period away). Ordering rule: ensure on-hand + in-transit + new_order covers (L+1)=5 weeks of demand to avoid lost sales before arrival. Required coverage = 5 * 90 = 450. Current coverage = 332, short = 118. Balance service vs holding cost by ordering minimal required quantity. Final order = 120 units (rounded slightly up to provide tiny buffer).",

No 3+ period sustained increase or decrease confirmed. c) Lead time / pipeline: historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; current in-transit=200 likely the order placed in P43 and will arrive in ~4 periods.

Product: ladies denim (seasonally steady, not a strong short-term holiday-only driver).
