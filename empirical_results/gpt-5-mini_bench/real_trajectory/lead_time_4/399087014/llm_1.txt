  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period date 2019-02-11 \u2014 no major SKU-specific holiday spike (Valentine's Day unlikely to materially change women's denim weekly demand). Product is ladies super-skinny denim; demand is regular, not highly seasonal in mid-February. b) Demand regime: historical weekly sales: 82, 35, 31, 48, 55 (weeks 2019-01-07 through 2019-02-04). The 82 looks like a one-off high; recent 3-week average = (31+48+55)/3 = 44. c) Lead time / pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals in history so actual lead time is unconfirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so there are no incoming units and no evidence of arrivals or lost orders. d) Inventory assessment: with L=4, decision now must cover current period demand plus the 4 periods where orders in-transit won't help (need coverage for L+1 = 5 periods). Using a conservative expected weekly demand of 50 units (rounded up from recent avg and to buffer variability), 5-period coverage = 250 units. Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit is $4/unit; carrying extra inventory reduces profit but stockouts are costly because lead time is long and unconfirmed. e) Order logic: place an order to cover ~5 weeks of demand (250 units) to avoid multi-period stockouts while we observe actual lead-time and demand pattern. If future concluded messages show different lead time or demand, adjust in subsequent periods.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday season) \u2014 observed recent holiday spikes (Periods 42,45,46). Demand analysis: recent demands are volatile but skew high late-Dec (P42=133, P45=204, P46=140; P43\u2013P46 avg\u2248104.5). Lead time & pipeline: actual LT=4 (confirmed). On-hand=0; in-transit=230 comprised of orders: P43\u2192100 (arrives this period P47), P44\u219260 (arrives P48), P45\u219220 (arrives P49), P46\u219250 (arrives P50). These arrivals replenish before demand in their respective periods. Decision logic: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (Periods 47\u201351). Using a conservative forecast ~100 units/week (given recent holiday volatility and several high weeks), 5-week demand \u2248500 units. Pipeline supplies 230 across P47\u2013P50, leaving shortfall \u2248270 units that must be ordered now (will arrive in Period 51). Balance profit ($4/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period) favors meeting demand during high season to avoid lost sales. Action: place order of 270 units.",
