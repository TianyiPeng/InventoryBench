{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (from carry-over). Pipeline: in-transit = 0, so no pending arrivals. On-hand = 258 units. Demand analysis: recent periods show sustained low demand for many weeks (Periods 23\u201345: weekly demand mostly single- to low-double digits; last three weeks 4,7,3). With L+1 = 5 review+lead horizon, even using a conservative per-week demand of 10 units \u2192 50 units needed; at observed ~5/week \u2192 ~25 units needed. Current on-hand (258) far exceeds required coverage. OR's recommendation (331) assumes higher historical demand and promised lead time but ignores the clear multi-period downward regime and current low sales; ordering would incur unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) and tie up capital. Decision: place 0 units order this period to avoid excess inventory, let on-hand gradually deplete toward demand-driven levels while monitoring for any sustained demand pickup or incoming shipment confirmations.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed = 4 periods (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=256, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory=256. Recent demand: last 8 periods (P39\u2013P46) = [6,6,4,3,4,7,3,2], avg \u2248 4.4/week; sustained low regime already recorded in carry-over. OR recommendation (328) uses long-horizon historical means and the promised L and ignores the sustained demand collapse; ordering that much would create large holding costs with low sales. With L+1=5 periods to cover, expected 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd74.4 \u2248 22 units; existing on-hand (256) far exceeds this need. Profit per unit $4 vs holding $1/period: unnecessary inventory reduces R_t. Therefore place no new order (0 units) to avoid extra holding cost and let on-hand deplete toward demand level.
