Assessment: current supply (1284) slightly exceeds the 5-period requirement, so no new order is needed now to avoid excess holding cost. Action: place no order this period and monitor arrivals and any holiday-driven surge. ",

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods historically (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so an order placed now will arrive in Period 50 and will cover demand starting then.
