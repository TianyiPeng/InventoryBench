Recent demand signals: elevated regime was previously recorded (Periods 31-33 avg ~362), recent weekly demand has been volatile (Periods 42-44 demands = 447,154,214) but the three-period elevated regime signal is already in carry-over. Using a conservative high single-period demand estimate (\u2248360 units) \xd7 5 periods = 1800 units needed to fully cover five periods at that elevated rate. However, that elevated regime is already reflected in existing in-transit orders (which were placed to respond to higher demand) and current pipeline (1320) covers ~3.7 weeks at 360/wk and far more weeks at long-run baseline (~260/wk \u2248 5.1 weeks). Cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1/unit/period \u2014 carrying extra units is expensive cumulatively each period. OR recommended 74 units (uses promised L and historical stats) but does not see in-transit or confirmed lead time. Decision: place 0 order. Rationale for order=0: existing pipeline (1320) is already large relative to typical weekly demand and many recent large arrivals have just occurred (visible arrivals in conclude history). Ordering now would increase holding cost immediately for many periods given long lead time (4) and risk overstock if demand subsides. We will monitor concluded arrivals next periods and only reorder if pipeline materially depletes below a conservative 5-period requirement given confirmed lead time and observed demand regime. Short operational note: do not trust OR cap blindly here because it ignores large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time; thus override to 0.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Override OR's 74 \u2192 order 0. We already have 1320 units pipeline+on-hand and confirmed lead time=4; placing new orders now would raise holding costs given long lead time and current inventory suffices for multiple weeks even under elevated demand.",
