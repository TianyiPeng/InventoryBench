Lead time & pipeline: actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history; orders placed now would arrive in Period 49 and be visible in Period 50. Current inventory position: on-hand=83, in-transit=380 \u2192 total pipeline=463 units. Coverage check: with L+1=5 periods coverage and expected near-term demand ~60\u201390/week, required \u2248300\u2013450 units. Existing pipeline (463) already covers the upper range. Cost tradeoff: profit per unit = $1 but holding cost = $1/period \u2014 excess inventory is costly. Action: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and because pipeline suffices for 4\u20135 weeks.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 potential short spike in demand but recent history shows a noisy holiday pattern (Period 42 had a large one-off spike=204). Demand regime: recent 5-week demand = {65,204,46,43,74} (mean\u224886, but 204 is an outlier). Lead time & pipeline: concluded lead_time = 4 periods. In-transit=380 likely from Periods 43 (230) and 44 (150) and will arrive in upcoming periods (arrivals expected during Periods 47 and 48). Inventory balance: on-hand=9 + in-transit=380 = 389 units already committed. Requirement: with L=4 we must cover L+1=5 future weeks; even using a conservative forecast of ~80/week needs ~400 units. Given existing pipeline (~389) and the high holding cost (=profit), placing additional order risks negative net reward if it increases ending inventory. Action: place no order and rely on incoming shipments to meet holiday demand while avoiding extra holding cost.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 \u2014 recent large spike in Period 42 (204) likely a one-off (Black Friday) not a sustained shift. Product is seasonal basics (denim); no major year-end sustained surge expected. Demand analysis: recent non-spike demands (Periods 43\u201346) = 46,43,74,47 (mean \u224852.5/week). Carry-over history confirms actual lead time = 4 (previous evidence). Lead-time & pipeline: In-transit=380 equals outstanding orders: Period43=230 (arrives this period) + Period44=150 (arrives next period). On-hand=0 now, but arrivals during Period47 will supply 230 before demand; total pipeline (on-hand+in-transit+arrivals) = 380. Inventory decision: required coverage = (L+1)=5 periods \xd7 forecast \u224852.5 \u2248 262\u2013275 units. Current pipeline (380) already exceeds required coverage, so do not place additional order to avoid holding cost ($1/unit/period) equal to profit.
