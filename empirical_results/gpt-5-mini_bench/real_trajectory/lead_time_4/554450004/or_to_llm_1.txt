With profit = holding ($1) the critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) so base-stock equals \u03bc\u0302; pipeline+on-hand (505) comfortably exceeds \u03bc\u0302 (393) so no replenishment needed. Risk check: no evidence of a new sustained demand regime change since Period 29 insight already recorded; orders in-transit have been arriving on the 4-period cadence historically, so do not treat in-transit as lost. Ordering would increase holding cost dollar-for-dollar with profit, so avoid extra inventory. Final action: place 0 units.",
