Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=33.8 units/week (N=5). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals \u2192 no evidence lead time differs from promised 4. Use promised lead time to keep arrivals aligned with contract. Use default demand estimates (1+L =5) so mu_hat = 5\xd7mean (backend calc) and default sigma (backend calc) to reflect full-sample uncertainty. This balances service (coverage for current+L periods) vs holding cost given modest holding rate ($1) and profit ($19). No overdue shipments detected.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~33.8/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (order from P1 has not arrived; arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 this is one delayed shipment but not yet a sustained lead-time change. I use promised lead time (default) because there is insufficient evidence (need \u22653 periods) to change L. I use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to keep targets aligned with historical baseline while avoiding overreaction to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (two orders of 45 from P1 and P2) but no arrivals have concluded \u2014 shipments are overdue or delayed. Historical weekly samples (Jan) show moderate demand (~34 mean) and recent observed demands in P1/P2 are 39 and 51 (too short to confirm a regime shift). No concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time. To avoid overreacting to two high weeks, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses the full sample mean/variance; this balances service (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost while we wait for concluded arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (many units expected but no concluded arrivals yet -> cannot confirm lead-time change). Historical weekly mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) = 33.8. Recent realized demand in concluded Periods 1-3 = [39,51,62], recent avg = 50.67 over 3 periods (sustained 3-period increase). I therefore keep L as default (use promised 4) because no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed upward regime shift; same for sigma to reflect higher recent volatility. This raises the backend base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while the default lead time avoids incorrectly shortening/lengthening pipeline given missing conclude data. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: avg increased from 33.8 to 50.67 (+50%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=211 (orders P1-4). Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet so do NOT change L. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime in recent periods (Periods 1-3); I use recent_N=3 to focus forecast on the new regime. sigma also set to recent_N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher demand while not overreacting to unresolved shipment status.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=1, in-transit=231. Concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4), confirming promised lead time. Recent demand evidence (concluded demands: P1=39, P2=51, P3=62, P4=53, P5=44) indicates a sustained higher-demand regime versus earlier sample mean (33.8). To reflect the new regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base_stock and caps using the latest 5-period demand pattern, balancing higher service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated vs earlier baseline (recent demands: P2-6 = 51,62,53,44,57; sustained higher mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=236 (covers several future periods but arrivals visible only next period). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use observed lead-time estimate. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 5 samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture current mean/volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). These parameters will raise the base-stock to protect service while the confirmed L=4 keeps timing consistent with observed arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals (P5-P7) confirm actual lead time = 4 periods for observed shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=241 (pipeline covers multiple incoming shipments). Historical weekly mean demand = 33.8 from provided samples; an earlier detected regime shift was recorded previously but not yet sustained beyond the documented periods. To align the OR backend with observed lead time and the established demand history, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed L and limited evidence for a new sustained demand regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has risen materially versus historical Jan samples: last 8 concluded weekly demands = [39,51,62,53,44,57,66,95] with a clear upward regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=203 (orders from P5-P8: 65+50+56+32=203) which aligns with observed arrivals; no additional missing shipments. Promised lead time is 4 and prior concludes confirm actual L=4, so use default promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 concluded demands P4\u2013P8 = [53,44,57,66,95]) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the most relevant recent window. This balances higher service needs (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost by using a moderate recent window (N=5) rather than all historical data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been well above the historical Jan samples: last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 5-9) = [44,57,66,95,73], mean=67.0. In-transit = 234, on-hand = 0. Promised lead time = 4 and prior concluded evidence confirms lead time ~4. With L\u22484, the replenishment should cover (1+L)=5 weeks; recent 5-week demand forecast \u2248335 units, so current pipeline (234) is short. To reflect the sustained higher recent regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility, and calculate for L to keep consistency with observed arrivals. These parameters will raise the backend base-stock to target higher service while the cap limits extreme orders and holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1), so prioritizing fill rates is appropriate.

Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=283; historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Recent demand has risen well above the older baseline (last 7 weeks average ~67), so I use the observed lead-time average and a recent-window forecast to capture the new higher regime while avoiding overreacting to the last 3 extreme weeks. This will raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level and reflect recent volatility in sigma to keep safety stock appropriate given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demands have jumped (last 5 periods demands = 66,95,73,81,145; mean=92) with a single large spike at P11 but overall elevated vs early-sample mean (~33.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=323 covers several periods but some past orders were delayed earlier\u2014carry-over confirmed lead time=4. I keep L=default (promised 4) because conclude messages confirm 4-period arrivals. To capture the recent higher demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the OR backend sets base stock for (1+L)\xd7recent mean (~5\xd792). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility. This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) while letting the capped order cap limit excessive orders given in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weeks show much higher demand (Periods 8-12 = 95,73,81,145,130) vs earlier baseline. Lead-time observations in concluded history consistently equal 4 periods; use calculated lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demand samples cover the recent surge). On-hand=0, in-transit=435; with L\u22484 the (1+L)=5 period forecast from recent mean (~104.8) implies ~524 units needed, so parameters bias orders upward to restore service while balancing holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=8, in-transit=496 (sufficient pipeline for multiple periods). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1->arrived P5 etc.). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 8 (demands: P8-13 = 95,73,81,145,130,88). To capture the new, higher-demand regime while the pipeline remains large, set L using observed lead times, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent data (last 6 periods P8-13) to reflect current variability and elevated mean. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given sustained higher demand) against holding cost (large in-transit reduces need to overshoot).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 8: avg demand P8-13 = 102.0 vs prior avg ~50.67 (+101%), sustained for 6 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 8 (avg P8-13 \u2248102) and observed lead time confirmations = 4. Current on-hand=12 and in-transit=510 (large pipeline) \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple periods of elevated demand, but we must set parameters to reflect the higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the P8-13 high-demand regime (N=6 is the sustained regime length), giving the OR engine a demand forecast matched to the new regime and volatility estimate to achieve the desired service level vs holding cost tradeoff.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand regime (Periods 8-15) is materially higher: avg demand \u2248102 units (sustained 8 periods). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (large pipeline). To match the sustained higher demand and confirmed LT=4, set L by calculate (use observed LT history), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. This raises target base-stock to meet service levels while sigma based on recent variability keeps safety stock appropriate; using observed LT avoids chasing lost shipments.

Demand jumped starting Period 8 and has been ~102/week vs prior ~50; this sustained regime shift is present in history but already recorded. I will use the promised/default lead time so backend uses L=4, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this leverages all data while the large in-transit pipeline will be considered by the capped ordering rule to avoid over-ordering given holding cost $1/unit.

Promised lead time is 4 and historically confirmed; use default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (regime from P8\u2013P17, length=10) so the OR engine targets inventory for the higher-demand regime and balances service vs holding given profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; I use calculate to capture that. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime since Period 8; the last 8 concluded weekly demands (P11-P18) average ~116.8, so I use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the current regime. Volatility is estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=8). This balances service (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given sizable pipeline (395) and on-hand (78).

Choose L=default to use promised (and observed) 4-period lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 7 concluded demand observations) so the backend raises the base-stock and safety stock accordingly while capping order size per its cap policy.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift that began at Period 8 (avg demand P8-20 \u2248 102, much higher than early-period mean \u224833.8). To capture the elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 8\u201320, length=13) for both mu and sigma so the OR backend's base-stock reflects current high demand while capping orders limits excess holding.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 (sustained elevated demand). To prioritize service during this sustained high-demand regime while the pipeline is large, keep L as promised (default) so OR uses promised lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-change high-demand regime (use N=14 covering Periods 8-21) so the base-stock and cap reflect the higher mean and volatility observed recently and avoid underordering. This balances service level (high profit $19) against holding cost ($1) by aligning forecasts with the sustained higher-demand data and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent 16-period history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 8 (avg ~102 over P8-13 and continued elevated demand through P23). On-hand=67, in-transit=541 \u2014 strong pipeline coverage, so avoid inflating safety stock based on older low-demand data. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=16 to align the forecast and volatility with the sustained higher-demand regime (captures the changepoint from Period 8 onward and prevents underforecasting).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 8 (many periods of weekly demand ~100+). On-hand=112 and in-transit=502 provide substantial coverage but demand remains elevated and variable. I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (covering Periods 8\u201324 where the higher regime persists) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean over the review+lead window. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=17 to capture the current volatility in that same regime. These choices bias the base-stock upward to maintain service during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma captures variability to set safety stock and limit holding cost exposure.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=211, in-transit=436; recent history shows consistent arrivals with confirmed 4-period lead time and no missing shipments. Demand has been elevated since Period 8 but the carry-over insight already records that regime shift. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed stable lead time and full sample history, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (high profit/lower stockouts) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 8 but no new changepoint in the last periods; on-hand=187, in-transit=354 (sufficient pipeline). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods. No overdue or lost shipments observed. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over available samples to balance service level vs holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods; recent demand has been elevated since Period 8 (recorded in history). To let the OR engine use full historical statistics and confirmed promised lead time, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes L=promised and (1+L)-scaled mean/std from all samples. This leverages the confirmed LT=4 while allowing the engine's capped policy to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Current on-hand 281 + in-transit 261 = 542 units; recent demand regime has been elevated since Period 8 (carry-over). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost, set demand forecast using recent data: recent_N with N=20 to weight the last ~20 periods' mean (covers the post-changepoint regime). Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters give the OR backend a forecast aligned to the sustained higher demand while the calculated L reflects observed lead-time evidence.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=334, in-transit=307 \u2014 healthy pipeline but demand has been variable since the large regime shift recorded earlier (Periods 8-13). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Given no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in recent periods, I use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=promised (4). This keeps the OR engine calibrated to full historical evidence while the backend's cap prevents extreme single-period orders, balancing high profit ($19) against $1 holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 arrivals). Current on-hand=282 + in-transit=307 => pipeline=589 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods at recent demand levels. Recent demand (Periods 25-30) = [79,106,81,67,59,52], recent mean \u2248 74 units/week. To reflect the recent lower post-peak regime I use recent_N (N=6) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes the base stock to recent demand (avoid overstocking from older high-demand samples). L set to calculate to confirm observed lead time=4. Sigma_hat also set recent_N (N=6) to capture current variability. No new sustained changepoint since prior insights, so no carry-over update.

Current available = on-hand 312 + in-transit 235 = 547 units (ample pipeline). To avoid overreacting to short-term volatility and because lead time is confirmed as 4, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/std over the (1+L) horizon. This balances service (high profit) with holding cost given large existing inventory and avoids excess ordering while protecting against demand uncertainty.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=338, in-transit=197 => total pipeline=535, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods of recent demand (last 5-week mean=54.2 \u2192 5\xd7mean\u2248271). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 repeatedly; recent demand has settled near ~50\u201360 (last 5 weeks mean=54.2) after prior spikes. I therefore keep L as promised (default) and set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current lower demand regime while sigma_hat uses default to leverage full-sample volatility. This balances service (capture recent mean \xd7 (1+L)) vs holding cost by avoiding legacy larger forecasts from earlier high-demand regime.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand (379) + in-transit (156) provides ample coverage vs recent demand, but to keep service high while avoiding excess holding cost I use the promised lead time and base forecasts from the most recent 6 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default to respect the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the recent regime and limit influence of earlier high-demand periods.

Lead time historically confirmed as 4 (sustained arrivals P5-P33); use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (P30-35). This keeps targets responsive to the lower post-spike demand while the pipeline is ample, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Current on-hand=320, in-transit=117; pipeline + on-hand well above recent weekly demand so risk of stockout is low. Historical concluded lead times have repeatedly been 4 periods (Periods 5-36 confirms), so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 32-36 = 51,74,43,65,33) shows a lower regime vs earlier spikes; choose recent_N=5 to focus forecast on current demand level. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture current volatility. These settings keep base-stock tied to current demand, limiting excess inventory while preserving service given ample on-hand + in-transit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=265, in-transit=117 (total pipeline=382) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of typical demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly); recent demand has returned to pre-spike levels with no 3+-period sustained new regime. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies the established statistics and caps while avoiding overreacting to transient fluctuations.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent history shows no new sustained demand regime change since recorded insights. To let the OR engine use full sample history and the confirmed promised lead time, set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)-horizon demand stats from all samples and standard deviation, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier) and current on-hand 300 + in-transit 219 = 519 units \u2014 ample coverage vs recent weekly demand (~30-70). No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoints since prior insights. To avoid excess ordering given high pipeline, use default lead time and default demand stats so backend will compute base-stock from historical samples; this minimizes unnecessary replenishment and holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has moderated vs the large spike earlier; on-hand=261 + in-transit=249 -> pipeline=510 (covers many weeks). Lead time has consistently concluded as 4 in history. To avoid further overstock, I base demand on the recent regime (lower demand since ~Period 29). I therefore use L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N using the last 12 demand samples to reflect the current lower-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. This reduces order targets versus using the long-run high mean and limits holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent weekly demand has settled at a moderate level (Periods 34-41 demands = 43,65,33,55,47,35,39,46; recent mean ~46). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 in concluded history. To reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid excess holding, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 8 weeks for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L as the promised/default (4). This keeps the OR backend responsive to the current lower-demand regime and leverages observed lead-time stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1655.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=264, in-transit=99. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 4 periods; no evidence of new lead-time regime, so keep promised lead time. Demand recently elevated and variable (last 9 concluded demands: P34-P42 = 43,65,33,55,47,35,39,46,101) \u2014 recent window captures the late-Nov spike (101) while reflecting prior mid-range weeks. I choose L=default to trust the promised/confirmed 4-period setting; use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent regime, balancing higher service level for the recent spike versus holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand changes while avoiding overstating long-term mean.

LLM Rationale:

Use promised/confirmed lead time to match observed supplier behavior and keep replenishment stable. Select default demand/volatility estimators so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L), preserving service level given high on-hand inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand (last 11 weeks, Periods 34-44) averages ~50 units/week with moderate variability; historical confirmed lead time = 4 periods. On-hand(277)+in-transit(145)=422 >> expected (1+L)*mean (~5*50=250), so no aggressive uplift needed. Set L via observed history, base demand using recent 11-sample mean to capture current regime, and estimate volatility from the same recent window so the OR backend sizes safety stock to current variability while avoiding extra holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent realized demand (Periods 40-45) averages ~56 units/week; on-hand=213, in-transit=145 (total pipeline 358). Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier). I choose L=default to use promised lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the latest regime (Periods 40-45) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and avoids overweighting much older low-demand samples. For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect current variability. This keeps orders sized to meet the near-term elevated demand while avoiding excess holding cost given already-large on-hand + in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=158, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly show 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 42-46 = 101,41,45,64,55) and surrounding weeks suggest current mean higher than early-sample mean; to capture current regime I use a recent_N demand estimate over the most recent 6 periods to reflect current demand level and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given healthy on-hand+pipleline) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than all-time averages.
