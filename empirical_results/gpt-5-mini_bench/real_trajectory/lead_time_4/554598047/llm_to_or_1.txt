Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Weekly demand history (5 samples): [0,0,9,23,26], mean=11.6/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time=4 periods. No concluded arrivals observed, no evidence of lead-time shift or sustained demand regime change (only 5 weeks, recent increase may be seasonal but not yet 3+ periods). Profit and holding cost equal -> service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0). Use promised lead time and dataset-wide demand moments so OR backend computes base stock conservatively across the full (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-02-18: recent historical weekly demand samples = [0,0,9,23,26] (mean 11.6) but Period 1 conclude shows a spike to 54 demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=32 (Period1 order arrived=0 in Period1 conclude \u2014 expected since arrivals occur after decision and promised lead time=4). No sustained multi-period shift yet, so keep promised lead time. Use EWMA to adapt partially toward the recent spike while avoiding overreaction. Set L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat via EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to weight recent high demand but retain history. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full samples.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=104. Two recent conclude messages show orders placed but arrived=0; this suggests delays but is not yet a confirmed change in lead time (only 2 missed arrival observations). No strong evidence of demand regime change beyond provided historical samples. To avoid overfitting to limited signals, use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level against holding cost while we gather more arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=145 (matches orders placed P1-3: 32+72+41). No concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time (4) still plausible. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) shows a sustained, large uplift vs. historical Jan samples. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (no concluded evidence to change). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime ((54,90,55) mean=66.33) across the review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping lead-time assumption unchanged until arrivals conclude, balancing service-level vs holding cost given profit=holding so target service quantile is 0.5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg (P1-3)=66.33 vs historical Jan avg=11.6 (+472%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=246. No concluded arrivals beyond Period 4, so cannot confirm any lead-time change yet; use promised lead time. Recent demand regime (noted in Period 4) shows much higher demand starting Period 1: recent strong demand in P1-P3 (avg 66.33). Use recent_N=3 to capture this new regime for forecast and volatility. Keeping L=default (promised 4) ensures OR engine schedules across the full review+lead horizon; using recent samples increases base_stock to meet elevated demand while sigma recent_N captures current variability. No new confirmed lost shipments or additional changepoint evidence, so do not alter lead time estimate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=258. Historical concluded arrival shows an observed lead time of 4 (P1 order arrived P5), matching the promised L=4. Demand has shifted up since Period 1 (recent periods P1-P5 mean high); I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. Set L to default (promised=4) because observed arrival equals promised. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 5 demand observations (periods 1\u20135 mean=56.4) so the base-stock covers elevated demand while capping over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand regime is elevated since Period 1 (carry-over). Confirmed observed lead times = 4 (concludes show P1->P5 and P2->P6). On-hand=8, in-transit=210 (large pipeline). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time average (4). Demand forecasting uses recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across the six most recent periods (reduces influence of sparse earlier historical samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the new regime while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=23, in-transit=240. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) so treat lead time as 4. Recent demand shows an elevated regime starting Period 1 (carry-over insight already recorded). Last 3 realized demands (Periods 5-7) = 54, 64, 26 \u2192 recent mean = 48; using recent_N=3 focuses the forecast on the current elevated regime while keeping variance sensitive to recent volatility. Setting L by calculation (observed avg) and mu_hat/sigma_hat by recent_N (N=3) tells the OR backend to size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current higher demand and to reflect recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=32, in-transit=139. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=4 (orders placed P1-P4 arrived P5-P8), so actual lead time confirmed. Demand has shifted up sharply since Period 1 (sustained high weekly demand across P1-P8). I set L via calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 8 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and safety stock to the current elevated mean and volatility while the capped order prevents excessive single-period receipts given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has shifted materially upward vs historical Jan levels (recent weeks: P5-9 demands = 54,64,26,92,102). On-hand=0, in-transit=193 \u2014 substantial pipeline but demand remains high; (L+1)=5 periods should be covered. Lead time has consistently been 4 in concluded history, so use calculated L to capture observed reality. Forecast demand using recent data (most recent 5 periods) to reflect the sustained higher regime; use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture recent volatility. These settings raise target base stock to meet elevated demand while letting OR backend cap orders per its policy to limit overstock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9).

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations). Recent demand has been in a higher regime starting Period 1 and sustained through Period 10 (use recent data to capture new mean/variance). Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and its volatility based on the sustained high-demand regime, which raises the base-stock to protect service while the capped order cap will limit excess holding given $1 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows sustained elevated demand since Period 1 (many weeks of demand >> historical Jan samples) and concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=281 (covers multiple future periods). I set L explicitly to 4 to reflect confirmed observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (all available recent periods P1\u2013P11) because a sustained higher-demand regime exists since Period 1; mu_hat will thus reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent samples, and sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture current volatility. This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than historical low-Jan samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has been high and stable since Period 5 (demands P5-P12 = 54,64,26,92,102,138,112,127) indicating a sustained elevated regime; pipeline=371, on-hand=0 so substantial stock is already inbound but arrivals are subject to confirmed 4-period lead time. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show W=4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 8 concluded demand periods (P5\u2013P12) to capture the current high-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the backend\u2019s base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while recognizing significant in-transit inventory arriving under 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Observed on-hand=2, in-transit=349. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent P1->P5 through P5->P9). Demand has been elevated vs the Jan samples; to capture recent high-volume regime I use a recent-window demand forecast. Choices: L=calculate to lock to observed average lead time (4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to weight the last 10 demand periods and reflect the sustained higher demand; sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility across (1+L) periods. This increases target base-stock to protect service given long lead time and large pipeline while default sigma keeps safety stock calibrated to historical volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has settled at a much higher regime (recent demands P9-P14 = 102,138,112,127,96,82; recent mean \u2248109.5) and historical lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. On-hand=38, in-transit=300 (multiple confirmed arrivals). I set L to the promised/default 4 (confirmed by concludes). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=6) so the backend builds base stock from recent mean over the review+lead period. I also use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect current volatility; these choices prioritize service (profit and sales) while limiting extra inventory by using a recent-sample volatility estimate rather than very large historical variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile vs the small Jan samples: last 11 concluded demands (P5\u2013P15) = [54,64,26,92,102,138,112,127,96,82,85], average \u2248 88.9. On-hand=18, in-transit=379 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). All observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4) which matches observed. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime; this focuses the base-stock on current demand while the large pipeline limits aggressive ordering. This balances service (capture high demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=12, in-transit=337; confirmed lead time=4 from prior concludes. Recent demand has been elevated since Period 8 (demands P8-P16 = [92,102,138,112,127,96,82,85,96]) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L to calculated (use observed average lead times) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (Periods 8\u201316, N=9), which balances service (captures the higher recent mean) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained elevated weekly demand across periods 1\u201317). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=396 which likely covers multiple weeks of demand under the elevated regime. I set L to be inferred from observations (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=17 (use the most recent regime evidence across all available samples) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean over the full recent regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=17 to capture current demand volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to current high demand while letting the backend cap prevent excessive orders and control holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=348. Historical early-Jan samples show low demand, but observed sustained higher demand since Period 1 with multiple high-demand weeks (recent sells 82\u2013160, recent spikes). Pipeline (348) likely covers several future periods given confirmed lead time=4, but demand regime remains elevated. Set L to promised (default=4). For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime; choose N=10 (captures the last 10 observed demand periods to reflect current volatility and mean). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to align volatility to recent regime. These choices raise base_stock to protect service level under higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind given profit=holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been persistently high (latest demands P13-P19: 96,82,85,96,113,160,111) indicating a sustained elevated regime vs earlier Jan samples. On-hand=33 and in-transit=356 provide substantial pipeline cover, but future demand remains volatile. Select L=default (promised 4) given repeated confirmations of 4-period arrivals in history. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to focus the forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (N=7 captures P13-P19), so (1+L)\xd7recent mean reflects current demand level. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility and avoid underestimating safety stock. These choices prioritize meeting high current demand while using recent volatility to limit excessive holding costs given already-large pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=450. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed previously). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (~~100 units/week) for many periods; in-transit (450) covers roughly 4.5\u20135 weeks so pipeline is substantial but demand remains high. I keep L as default (use promised lead time=4) because concluded history supports it. I set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime (use last 12 periods to capture sustained elevated demand while limiting very old low-Jan samples). I keep sigma_hat default to let the backend scale variability across the review+lead period. This balances service (capture recent high mean) against holding cost given a large existing pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P1->P5 ... P17->P21). Recent demand has settled higher than early-year levels; last 5 concluded demands (P17-P21) = [113,160,111,109,82], mean=115. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed by observations). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 = 5\xd7115). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. On-hand (53) + in-transit (420)=473 vs (1+L) mean demand 575 \u2014 this raises pipeline shortfall risk; recent_N choices increase recommended target to reduce stockouts while acknowledging holding cost symmetry (profit=holding cost). No evidence of lost shipments beyond already-confirmed patterns.

Pipeline (501) already large relative to typical weekly demand so avoid inflating lead-time or mean estimates. Set L to promised (default=4) consistent with observed arrivals. Use recent_N for demand (N=10) to capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. Use recent_N for sigma (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock driven by recent realized demand while preventing over-ordering given the large in-transit stock, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=66, in-transit=349 (ample pipeline versus recent demand). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and more variable versus the sparse Jan samples; to reflect the upshift and recent volatility I use recent_N for both mean and std to focus the forecast on the latest regime (N=12 captures ~3 months of weekly data). These parameters prioritize service (meet high recent demand) while the cap and holding cost in the OR backend will limit excessive orders given current large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=56, in-transit=301; historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 and sustained elevated demand since early periods. Pipeline (301) plus on-hand largely covers near-term demand but demand remains well above original historical Jan samples. I select L=default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce influence of low-Jan samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to match the persistent higher demand while using observed lead time to avoid over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=68, in-transit=330; recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed). Demand has been elevated vs initial Jan samples but evidence already recorded earlier. I choose to use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock using all historical samples (robust to past regime and aligns with confirmed LT=4). This keeps orders sized by backend's capped policy, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Recent demand is substantially higher than the sparse Jan samples; to capture the current high-demand regime I use a recent-window forecast. L chosen by calculation from observed lead times to confirm empirical 4-period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=20) to weight the most recent demand history (captures sustained higher demand and recent variance), which guides the OR engine to a larger base-stock while the cap limits extreme orders\u2014this balances service (profit=holding) vs holding cost risks given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=21, in-transit=380. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent order activity aligns with that (orders placed show arrivals after 4 periods). Demand has been at an elevated, sustained level since early periods (already captured in carry-over). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed behavior while avoiding overfitting, use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates (use all samples) so the backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock and confirmed L=4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=52, in-transit=286; historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 confirms). Pipeline plus on-hand currently large relative to recent weekly demand but demand regime since Period 1 is materially higher than early-Jan levels. I set L to 'calculate' to formalize the confirmed 4-period lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (recent 12 periods capture current mean/variance and avoid dilution by low-Jan samples). Using recent demand statistics helps the OR backend produce a base-stock that balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding costs given already-large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been elevated and variable (multiple weeks of 50\u2013160 units), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (4). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to focus on the latest 5 demand samples (captures recent elevated demand while keeping N small per changepoint guidance). For sigma_hat use default to let backend scale overall sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize matching current high demand while avoiding excess inventory by relying on backend cap and measured volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has softened versus mid-year peaks: last 4 demands = [51,63,68,40] (mean ~55.5), while earlier periods showed large spikes. On-hand=78, in-transit=307 (healthy pipeline). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in history; use promised lead time (default). To make the OR engine responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while still covering the 5-period review+lead window, I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=8 to capture the most recent regime (balances noise vs recency). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstocking risk given large pipeline and high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit=$1), while keeping service by accounting for 5-period demand using recent data.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculate to reflect observed lead times. Demand forecasting: use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-regime recent demand (to weight recent ~63\u201340 range rather than the small Jan samples). Use the same recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

On-hand=257, in-transit=38 \u2014 ample coverage vs (1+L) demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concludes; use promised/default lead time. To keep the OR backend responsive to recent lower demand while preserving service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the last 5 weeks).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 concluded demands: 28,46,22,23,21) after earlier high-volatility periods; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Use promised/default lead time to respect confirmed LT=4. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking; use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and substantial on-hand inventory (245) plus small in-transit (6), so we prioritize conservative forecasts from recent data.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=217, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 30-37) has returned to lower levels vs early spike; no evidence of a new sustained regime. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps base-stock conservative given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5 -> z*=0) and avoids overreacting to transient swings while ensuring pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=199, in-transit=125. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been low and stable since Period 30 (demands P30\u2013P38 = [40,32,28,46,22,23,21,34,18]); I detect a recent low-demand regime (~9 periods). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I use promised L (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime (recent_N with N=9) so the OR backend targets stocking for the current low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Current inventory: on-hand=180, in-transit=125. Profit=$1, holding=$1 (symmetric). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has settled much lower than earlier surge; last 8 concluded weekly demands (P32\u2013P39) average \u224826.4 units/week. I set L by calculate to use observed lead-time history (confirming 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current low-demand regime across the review+lead horizon (5 weeks) and reduce excess ordering vs using long-run elevated means. This balances service (cover ~5\xd726.4\u2248131.9 expected demand) against holding cost given high on-hand stock and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=170, in-transit=125. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen to a lower regime since Period 30: demands P30-P40 = [40,32,28,46,22,23,21,34,18,19,10], recent mean \u2248 27.9 over 11 periods (sustained ~11 periods). To keep the OR engine responsive to the current low-demand regime while preserving service with L=4, I use L=default (promised 4), mu_hat based on the recent regime (recent_N, N=11) and sigma_hat similarly (recent_N, N=11). This reduces target base-stock to match the recent lower demand and limits excess holding given profit=holding ($1 vs $1).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand (Periods 34-41) is low and stable (range ~10\u201334, recent weeks ~10\u201319) and historical concluded lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand=156, in-transit=125 \u2014 pipeline coverage already substantial. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms 4. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (last 8 concluded demand samples) so the (1+L) forecast and volatility focus on current regime and avoid overweighting early high spikes. This reduces excess safety stock while preserving service given current low demand and high pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (~10\u201325 units) with no new 3+ period regime shift. On-hand = 256, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample cover versus recent demand; no overdue shipments visible. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise and keeps holding cost control given high on-hand inventory.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand, use recent demand to set forecast. Set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to focus the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 5 periods and reflect the current low-demand regime, reducing replenishment intensity and holding cost exposure.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history. To align the OR backend's (1+L)=5 review horizon with current low recent demand, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast captures the latest low regime and reduces excess ordering. L uses the promised/default (4) consistent with confirmed lead time. This balances service (cover ~5 periods of recent demand) against high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit), avoiding overstocks.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Current on-hand=226, in-transit=59; recent weekly demand has been low (last months mostly 7\u201325 units) after earlier summer spike. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use promised/default L. To anchor forecast to recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=12 (captures ~3 months of recent weeks) so the OR backend sets base_stock to recent demand level; sigma_hat kept default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This reduces over-ordering given high on-hand and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has settled low (Dec weeks: ~7\u201325, recent avg \u224813) after earlier high-summer regime; on-hand=211, in-transit=59 (pipeline=270) well above short-term demand. No new late/lost shipment signals; confirmed lead time=4 in history. To avoid excess holding cost I keep L as promised and set demand forecast and volatility from the recent low-demand regime using the last 8 periods to reflect current winter demand, which will reduce replenishment compared with using full-history (caps downstream orders and lowers holding cost).
