Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~185/week (samples: 289,161,122,154,201) with no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time is 4. No sustained changepoint or delivery delays detected. I select default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level against holding cost given limited history and no evidence of regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=292 (order placed P1 shows arrived=0 in P1 conclude; insufficient evidence to declare lost or change lead time\u2014need multiple periods overdue). Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean demand = 185.4. Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet to infer a different L. Use default L and demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean) which matches available history and avoids overreacting to a single missing conclude. This balances service level (use 5-period demand sum) vs holding cost given moderate holding cost ($1) and profit ($4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly samples (289,161,122,154,201) give mean\u2248185.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=570 from prior orders; no concluded arrivals yet (Period1/2 orders still not arrived). Promised lead time is 4 periods and there is insufficient concluded evidence to change it, and missing arrivals may indicate delay/loss but not yet sustained. I choose L=default to use promised lead time. Demand forecast uses mu_hat=default so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures historical level \u2248927 for 5-period review+lead). Volatility uses sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These conservative defaults keep target base-stock aligned with historical demand while the pipeline (570) is monitored; they avoid overreacting to unconfirmed late arrivals while letting OR engine cap orders to limit excess inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks through 2019-02-04) show mean ~185.4/wk and std ~64.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=837 (multiple prior orders have not concluded yet but promised lead time is 4). No concluded arrivals contradicting promised L, so keep promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap using full-sample stats; this keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for the long pipeline (837 units) and avoids overreacting to apparent delays that are not yet confirmed by conclude messages.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=925. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20134) shows no arrivals yet; per rules we cannot infer a lead-time change until we observe concluded arrivals. Demand samples (given five weeks: 289,161,122,154,201) yield mean \u2248185.4. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the policy conservative given large in-transit stock and no confirmed lead-time shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $663.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4, matching the promised 4-period lead time. On-hand=101, in-transit=633; pipeline + on-hand (734) comfortably covers the (1+L) demand horizon. Historical weekly demand samples mean=185.4 (5 samples). I use default lead time to trust the observed confirmation, and default mu/sigma so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock against holding cost (profit=4, holding=1 => moderate service target) while leveraging the confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: arrived=292 units ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4 periods)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: Period 1 order arrived after 4). On-hand=227, in-transit=546 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=773, which already covers multiple (L+1)=5-periods of expected demand given historical mean (~185/week). No evidence of a demand regime shift in the recent samples; shipments are arriving at promised cadence. Set L to default (use promised lead time=4) so OR backend uses known promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, which is appropriate given no sustained demand change and abundant pipeline preventing stockouts while holding cost remains moderate (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P3 arrived with W=4). On-hand=283, in-transit=421; demand history shows moderate weekly variability (samples from Jan-Feb). Use calculated L from observed lead times to lock in confirmed 4-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving long-run demand estimate while the confirmed lead time is enforced. This balances service (profit $4 vs hold $1) by letting the OR engine set base stock with correct lead time and historical demand stats.

Daily Reward (R_t): $724.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has risen vs the Jan samples: Periods 5-8 demands = [191,152,211,219] (mean 193.25). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history (consistent arrivals P5-P8). On-hand=152, in-transit=563 (pipeline=715) so current coverage is healthy vs recent demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 periods). For variability I use recent_N (N=4) so the backend scales recent sample std by sqrt(1+L). This keeps service high during the confirmed 4-period lead time while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/4/15. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 conclude). On-hand=0, in-transit=806 which is slightly below the (1+L)-period demand sum from historical weekly mean. Use default demand estimates based on full sample history (no recent regime change detected). Choosing L=default (promised 4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat=default lets the OR backend compute base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost using all available samples while accounting for the confirmed lead time and current pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent demand (Periods 5-10) = [191,152,211,219,159,125] shows a sustained post-Jan regime (higher, variable weekly demand). On-hand=66, in-transit=754; pipeline plus on-hand comfortably covers upcoming demand but some earlier orders had delayed visibility, so use observed lead-time evidence. Set L by calculation of observed lead times (all observed = 4). For demand forecasting use recent_N on the last 6 periods to capture the current regime mean/volatility rather than stale Jan samples; sigma also recent_N with N=6 to reflect current variability. These choices keep base-stock aligned to current demand spikes while avoiding excess inventory buildup given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent on-hand=88, in-transit=743; historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4. Demand recent weeks (Periods 7-11): 211,219,159,125,120 \u2014 moderate, slightly lower last two weeks. Set L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent regime (last 5 demand observations) to avoid diluting with older winter samples and to balance service level vs holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Current on-hand=364, in-transit=433 \u2192 total pipeline=797. With promised L=4, review+lead horizon =5 periods; default forecast (1+L)*mean = 5*185.4 = 927 units, so pipeline currently below the default coverage target. I choose default L and default demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock using full historical mean/variance; this balances service level (using confirmed 4-period lead time) against holding cost given moderate on-hand stock and some in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent sales have been steady (historical sample mean ~185 units/week). On-hand=422, in-transit=379 -> total pipeline+on-hand=801, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand under baseline estimates. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history; no evidence of a demand regime shift (recent demands ~80\u2013211 fluctuate but no sustained change). Use default L and default demand dispersion to let backend apply aggregated historical moments and the capped ordering cap to balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has softened versus early spikes; last 5 concluded period demands = [120,115,82,81,79], avg=95.4. On-hand=474, in-transit=312 \u2192 pipeline=786, which already exceeds (1+L)*recent mean (5*95.4=477). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised/default lead time and base stock sized from the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the current lower-demand regime. Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=492, in-transit=221. Recent 12-week demand shows a sustained downward shift from ~200s in Mar-Apr to ~70\u2013120 in May; no missing shipments (arrivals in prior concludes match orders, lead time consistently 4). To keep service while reducing holding cost I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the lower recent mean and volatility. Set L=calculate to lock in the observed lead time average (4 periods). Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, lowering base stock versus older higher-demand data and reducing excess inventory carry.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=512, in-transit=205. Historical early-sample mean ~185 but recent realized weekly demand has dropped into the 50\u2013120 range (most recent demands: 73,79,81,82,115,120,125,159,219,211,...), and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To let the OR backend use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats while keeping service level tuned to profit/holding cost, I select default lead time and default demand variance/mean (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service versus holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and confirmed L=4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6 conclude). On-hand = 546, in-transit = 219 gives healthy coverage vs recent weekly demand (recent concluded demands mostly 50-200 range). Use promised/confirmed lead time to let backend compute base-stock from full sample history; no recent demand regime change evident from history samples. Default mu_hat/sigma_hat let OR engine combine long-run demand stats with L=4. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies higher target fill) while avoiding explicit overstocking given current high on-hand.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has declined vs. early-season peaks (recent weekly sales ~43-125, latest =43), and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. No evidence of lost shipments. Inventory is ample vs. recent demand, so use default/robust settings: keep promised lead time (default) and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding overfitting short recent dips.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 Period 21. Recent demand has fallen markedly versus earlier weeks; current on-hand=548 + in-transit=216 => 764 units in pipeline/on-hand, which covers multiple weeks at current lower demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude). I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new low-demand regime (uses last 7 demand observations to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the lower, sustained demand level while keeping safety stock proportional to observed recent variability, reducing overstock risk given confirmed LT=4 and existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift between Periods 5-11 (avg demand \u2248168 units/week) and Periods 14-20 (avg demand \u224857 units/week), a decrease of ~66% sustained for 7 periods (Periods 14\u201320).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Last 5 observed demands (Periods 17\u201321) = [52,51,43,19,15], mean=36/week. On-hand=589, in-transit=160 => pipeline=749 units, well above forecast need. Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime ((1+L)*recent_mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower volatility and avoid overordering given large on-hand inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). Demand dropped sharply starting around Period 14 and has remained low through Periods 14\u201322 (example recent demands P14\u2013P22: 81,79,73,52,51,43,19,15,9). On-hand (679) + in-transit (61) is ample vs. depressed demand. I use L=default (promised 4). For demand I focus on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=9 to capture Periods 14\u201322 average (stable low regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces order targets and avoids excess holding costs while maintaining service. This balances the high profit/holding tradeoff by lowering target base stock to recent realized demand levels and reflecting recent volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=736, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped sharply and stabilized at very low levels in the last 4 periods (Periods 21\u201324 demand = 15,9,2,2). Previously recorded carry-over confirms lead time = 4. To avoid excess holding cost given the new low-demand regime, I use recent_N=4 to forecast demand and volatility over the review+lead period so the OR backend targets a much lower base stock appropriate for the current regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=732, in-transit=0; ample inventory versus recent low demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand regime drop confirmed (Periods 14\u201320 and onward) with recent weekly sales very low (recent demands: 19,15,9,2,2,4...). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast and volatility based on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect confirmed 4-period promise; mu_hat=recent_N with N=12 to use the most recent 12 periods (captures the sustained low-demand regime) so base-stock targets shrink; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=12 to reduce safety stock reflecting lower observed variability. This reduces future orders and holding cost while keeping enough stock for 80% service tendency (profit/ (profit+holding) = 0.8).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=732, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has shifted to a lower regime since Period 14 (sustained low weekly sales across many periods); recent weekly demands are very low (Periods 14\u201326). I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to confirm the confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=13) to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent low-demand regime (captures sustained drop and recent variability). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has fallen sharply and remained low since Period 14 (carry-over noted). On-hand = 727, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample stock, no outstanding pipeline. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time previously confirmed as 4 and no new contrary evidence. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new low-demand regime (sustained ~7 periods) so mu_hat reflects reduced (1+L)-period demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect lowered volatility. This keeps OR base-stock low while avoiding excess orders given current high on-hand and low demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=721, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been very low and stable (Periods 24-28 demands = 4,0,5,6,6), consistent with the previously recorded downward regime. No shipments are currently overdue (last arrivals matched 4-period lead time historically). To avoid overstocking given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit, keep promised lead time and base forecasts on the most recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current low mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent low volatility. These parameters bias orders toward lower replenishment to minimize holding costs while preserving service for current low demand.

To avoid over-ordering into the prolonged low-demand regime I keep L at the promised/confirmed value and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent sustained low-demand behavior and avoid inflating forecast from older high-demand weeks. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 so variability reflects the recent low regime, tightening safety stock and reducing holding cost exposure.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=714, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14 (weekly demand ~2\u20136) after the earlier high-demand regime; recent 5 demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [0,5,6,2,5], mean=3.6/week. No shipments expected (in-transit=0) and holding cost is high relative to profit tradeoff but target service level q=profit/(profit+holding)=4/5=0.8. I keep lead time at the promised/default 4 (confirmed historically), and estimate demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the sustained low regime: mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low average demand over the (1+L) review+lead horizon; sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. This avoids new ordering given large on-hand inventory while letting the OR engine compute a low replenishment target.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 P32. Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 14; last 5 observed weekly demands = [5,6,2,5,6], mean=4.8. Many concluded lead-time observations = 4 periods. On-hand=708, in-transit=0 \u2014 stock is ample (covers >> (1+L) periods). To avoid excess holding cost, use L inferred from observations and forecast demand from the most recent low-demand regime (last 5 weeks). This yields a small review+lead demand (1+L)*mean via recent_N=5; volatility also estimated from the same recent window. These parameters tell the OR engine to order minimally (pipeline + on-hand already suffices), balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has fallen sharply and stayed low since Period 14: earlier regime (Periods 5-11) avg \u2248168/wk, recent regime (Periods 14-32) avg \u22484\u201315/wk (sustained low demand across ~19 periods). On-hand=704, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs. current low demand, so place minimal forward-looking inventory. Lead time confirmed historically as 4 periods; I will keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, I set demand forecast using recent samples (capture the low regime) with N=13 (recent stable window) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces order targets and lowers holding cost while maintaining service. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments needed (arrivals have matched promised L=4 historically).

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift to low weekly demand since Period 14 (avg \u22485\u20137 recent weeks). To reflect the confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the new low-demand regime (20 most recent weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps target inventory aligned to current low demand, reducing holding costs while preserving service.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=690, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop from Period 14 onward (weekly demand now very low). To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and persistently low demand, keep promised lead time and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime while smoothing noise.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been at a much lower regime (since ~Period 14) with weekly sales mostly 0\u20137 and current on-hand=687, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes, and no recent arrivals are pending. To avoid further overstocking I keep L as default (promised lead time = 4) but use recent demand to set forecast and volatility. I detect a sustained low-demand regime spanning many periods (use max recent window capped at 20) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the current low mean and low variance; this will drive the OR engine to order little/no additional units and prioritize holding-cost reduction given high on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14 (~57 avg) confirmed in carry-over; current on-hand=686, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for many weeks so avoid aggressive replenishment. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent regime data: use recent_N with N=20 (most recent 20 weeks of the low-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent low-demand regime, limiting orders and reducing holding cost given large on-hand inventory and low demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=684, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime drop starting around Period 14 with very low weekly demand (mostly 0\u20137 units/week) through Period 39. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To reflect the new low-demand regime I use recent data for demand (last 15 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the low mean and low volatility; L set to calculated average of observed lead times (=4) to match observed behavior. This keeps orders minimal given high on-hand stock and low demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=681, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (arrivals consistently from orders placed 4 periods earlier) and a sustained demand regime drop since Period 14 (Periods 14\u201340 show low weekly demand ~1\u20137 vs earlier ~100+). To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) review+lead demand under the low-demand regime, I keep L as default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (N capped at 20 per rules). This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and uncertainty vs using all historical high-demand samples, aligning orders with current low demand and limiting holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=681, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 14 (weekly demand mostly 0\u20137) following an earlier high regime; no new arrivals expected. Promised lead time has been confirmed previously as 4 periods, so keep L as default. Forecast demand using the most recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures Periods 22\u201341 behavior) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to match the current low-consumption environment and avoids excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical data and prior carry-over show lead time confirmed at 4 and a sustained demand regime drop (Periods 14\u201320) followed by many low-demand weeks (Periods 25\u201342). With high on-hand and near-zero pipeline, I do not expect immediate arrivals; to avoid overstocking I base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set L to promised/default (4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (use last 18 weeks for mean and std to reduce influence of the early high-demand weeks).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=676, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 14 (recent weekly demand typically 0\u20137 units), far below the early-sample mean. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods historically. To avoid over-ordering given very low recent demand and high on-hand, I keep L at default (promised = 4) but forecast demand and volatility from the recent low-demand regime using the last 20 weeks to reflect the sustained drop and reduce future replenishment. This reduces base-stock and cap calculations, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the current low demand environment.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent demand (Periods 25\u201344) averaged ~3.05 units/week with low volatility; current on-hand=675, in-transit=0 (no incoming). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. Given very low ongoing demand and large on-hand, keep promised lead time to avoid increasing pipeline. Set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L)\xd7forecast: (1+4)\xd73.05 \u2248 15.25 to reflect current low weekly demand. Set sigma_hat explicitly to a modest volatility (\u22484.5) to reflect observed variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices tell the OR engine to target a small replenishment level (given high on-hand) and prioritize avoiding additional arrivals that would raise holding cost while maintaining service for low demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 14 (avg \u22482\u20138/wk); on-hand = 667, in-transit = 0 \u2014 enough to cover many weeks at current low demand, so order quantity should be conservative. Use promised lead time (default=4) since lead time has been previously confirmed but backend expects promised value. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should be based on the most recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand behavior while smoothing short noise. This reduces target base-stock and prevents excess holdings given $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 14 (weekly demands mostly 0\u20138), so I bias forecasts to recent data to avoid further holding cost while meeting low demand. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent low-demand regime (stable over many periods) and reduce base-stock sizing accordingly.
