{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (multiple P1->P5 ... P9->P13 arrivals). Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=658 (these in-transit units have no conclude yet but past evidence indicates they will arrive with 4-period lead time). Demand outlook: recent weeks show volatile demand with a large one-off spike (P42=227) followed by normal/declining weeks (P43\u2013P46 = 87,108,104,72). OR recommended 0 using promised L and historical mean; with profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5 (no safety stock). Given large pipeline (658) which covers many future weeks even under elevated demand (658 >> typical weekly demand ~80\u2013120), placing additional order now increases holding cost without improving service. Risk of lost shipments is low because many prior orders did conclude on the 4-period cadence. Decision: place 0 units to avoid excess holding cost and follow OR's capped baseline because pipeline already adequately covers (L+1)-period demand and no new sustained regime or lead-time change is observed.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order: in-transit 658 units (with confirmed 4-period lead time) sufficiently covers upcoming demand; ordering more would raise holding cost while OR's baseline recommends 0.",
