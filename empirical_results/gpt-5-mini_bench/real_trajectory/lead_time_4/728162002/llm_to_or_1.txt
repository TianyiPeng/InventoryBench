Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. Demand history (weekly): 36,21,10,12,16 (mean=19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. No sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected. Use promised lead time and default demand statistics to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=37 (ordered P1) but no concluded arrival yet; promised lead time=4 so this is expected. Historical weekly sample mean \u224819 (5 samples) but Period 1 demand=46 (one large week) \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. To avoid overreacting to a single spike and because we lack concluded lead-time evidence, use default lead time and default demand estimates derived from all samples. This keeps the OR backend anchored to historical mean while letting the engine compute safety stock/ordering using promised L and full-sample volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~19 units/week (36,21,10,12,16). On-hand=0, in-transit=85; no concluded arrivals observed yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service vs. holding given limited evidence and avoids overfitting to the sparse recent history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=153. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [36,21,10,12,16], mean=19.0. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded yet; no confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean from full sample and standard deviation across full sample.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan) mean ~19 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=180 (sum of prior orders). No concluded arrivals yet in history (we only see Period 1-4 concludes). Promised lead time=4; cannot confirm actual lead time from concluded messages yet. To be conservative and let the OR backend use its standard stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility scaling: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps parameters anchored to historical demand while the arrival pattern resolves; it avoids overreacting to apparent in-transit volume until arrivals are conclusively observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=202. Concluded history shows one arrival: Period 5 reported arrived=37 (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 4). Several orders remain in-transit and earlier periods had zero arrivals until P5, suggesting promised lead time of 4 is being observed. Demand history samples (Jan\u2013Feb) used as baseline. I set L to 'calculate' to lock to observed lead-time evidence (avg observed = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1) and uncertain in-transit arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 concluded: order placed P1 arrived in P5 => lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=284. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1->arrived P5; P2->arrived P6). No sustained demand regime change detected in historical samples (mean\u224819/week). To respect confirmed lead time and let the OR engine use full historical demand, set L by calculating observed lead times and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps safety stock aligned to profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for the 4-period pipeline and the large in-transit volume.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (multiple overdue orders have since concluded showing actual lead time=4). Recent concluded history (Periods 5-7) confirms orders placed in P1-P3 arrived with lead_time=4. Given confirmed lead time equals promised 4 and no clear sustained demand regime shift in the small historical sample, use default statistical settings so the OR backend computes base_stock from all samples. This keeps calculations stable while pipeline (375) is large versus current on-hand, avoiding unnecessary extra ordering that raises holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-08: on-hand=0, in-transit=483. Historical small-sample data (Jan) shows low baseline, but recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5-8: 234,311,250,94) indicates a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5. Lead times observed consistently =4. I set L to calculate to use observed lead-time data. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the four most recent high-demand weeks, improving service during this elevated regime while the pipeline (483) covers near-term needs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=798. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6 conclude). Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 234,311,250,94,187) shows a sustained higher regime vs. older Jan samples; I use recent_N (N=5) to capture this shifted mean/volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods) so the OR backend stocks for the current elevated demand while avoiding reliance on stale low winter samples. L set to observed average (calculate) to lock in confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Historical concludes consistently show orders placed in P1\u2013P6 arriving after 4 periods (evidence: P5 conclude shows P1\u2192P5, P6 conclude shows P2\u2192P6, etc.), so actual lead time confirmed at 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=946 (large pipeline covering many periods) \u2014 avoid inflating target stock. I set L by averaging observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4 signal (method=calculate). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; with L=4 this yields a conservative forecast using full historical data while the large in-transit pipeline will cap orders via the backend cap.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent demand has stepped up sharply starting Period 5 (concluded demands P5-P11 = 234,311,250,94,187,203,104). Observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (use calculate). On-hand=55 and large in-transit=787 already provide significant coverage vs. demand; to reflect the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N=7 (periods P5\u2013P11) for demand mean and volatility so the backend bases base_stock on the post-changepoint demand profile. This reduces risk of understocking given sustained higher demand while allowing the capped ordering rule to limit order size given the large pipeline.

Recent demand since Period 5 (2019-03-11\u21922019-04-29) is substantially higher than the Jan samples. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201312). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices make mu_hat reflect the new, higher mean over the review+lead period and sigma_hat capture current variability so the OR backend sets a larger base stock while limiting over-ordering given holding cost. On-hand + in-transit (880 total) provides cover, but parameters update forecasts to avoid understock if high demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5 (2019-03-11): avg demand increased from historical sample mean ~19 to recent mean ~185 (Periods 5\u201312 avg \u2248185; +~873%).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand regime (from Period 5) is much higher than the historical 2019-Jan samples; recent realized weekly demands (P5\u2013P13) average substantially above historical. On-hand=395 + in-transit=476 provides large pipeline cover. No overdue/lost shipments visible; observed concluded lead times are all 4. I set L by calculating observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (last 9 concluded demand samples since the regime shift at P5) to capture the new higher mean and variance so the OR backend increases base-stock while avoiding excessive inventory by relying on recent volatility for sigma_hat.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods across many concluded orders. On-hand = 599, in-transit = 198 (pipeline large). Demand shows a prior regime shift (Period 5 spike) but the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 9\u201314 demands = 187,203,104,108,61,74) give a more relevant forecast for near-term. To avoid further overstock given high pipeline and equal profit/holding ($1/$1), I use a calculated lead time (avg observed = 4) and recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to the latest demand regime and volatility, reducing ordering aggressiveness vs. the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (post-change average much higher than the Jan samples). On-hand=530, in-transit=198. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 5\u201315) to capture the new higher-demand regime (avg \u2248154 over those 11 periods) and its volatility, so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect current demand rather than older low-volume samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by using the recent regime statistics.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=627, in-transit=95. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a large demand regime shift beginning Period 5; recent demand has softened versus the P5\u2013P12 spike. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), use promised/confirmed lead time (default). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the more recent post-spike demand pattern (last 8 samples) rather than long-run pre-spike history; this keeps base-stock responsive to the recent decline while capturing short-term variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand 559 + in-transit 43 = 602 units. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly). Recent realized demand has moved to a higher, volatile regime vs the original small-sample history; however the most recent 7 periods (Periods 11\u201317) better reflect current sales pace. To protect service with promised lead time=4 and avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 7 demand observations (recent_N N=7) so the OR backend builds a base-stock that reflects the current demand regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical data and carry-over show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (avg \u2248185 over P5\u2013P12). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclude messages. I choose L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-change high-demand regime (Periods ~11\u201318 / recent 8 periods) so mu_hat reflects the new mean across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimation tied to the same recent window.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand through Period 19). On-hand=169, in-transit=88; last order (Period 19: 45) is within promised 4-period lead time and not overdue. Lead time confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history; therefore set L to calculated (avg observed). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the new higher mean/variance: recent_N N=15 (Periods 5\u201319) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std. This biases orders toward the new higher demand while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for the observed 4-period lead time.

Use L="calculate" to lock in observed lead time estimate from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-changepoint regime (recent 8 demand observations reflect the new higher mean and current downward drift) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current demand level/volatility over the review+lead horizon and avoid diluting with pre-shift low-demand history.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time =4 and a large demand regime shift earlier in the year; recent demand (Periods 11\u201321) remains materially higher than the 2019-01 samples. To avoid stockouts given long lead time and elevated recent demand, use recent_N demand estimates based on the last 11 observed demand periods (Periods 11\u201321). Keep L as default (promised = 4). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the OR backend size the base stock to cover the elevated recent demand while sigma_hat from the same window captures current volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 5 (weekly demands mostly 100\u2013311 since then) and confirmed consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=597 \u2014 significant pipeline covers several weeks but recent weekly demand (~170\u2013220) remains high. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (covers the post-shift regime from Period 5 onward) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean across the (1+L) review+lead window; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=18 to capture volatility in the new regime. These parameters prioritize service (profit and lost-sales avoidance) given equal profit and holding costs and the clear sustained demand increase, while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula to limit over-ordering against pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime (from Period 5 onward) is much higher (~150\u2013200/wk) than the historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=724 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will cover multiple weeks given elevated demand, but service risk remains if shipments are lost. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4; I let backend compute average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate capturing the post-change regime (N=19 periods from Period 5\u201323) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead window. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=19) to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders toward the confirmed high-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering if shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=10, in-transit=499; pipeline ample vs recent demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift to much higher weekly demand beginning Period 5; recent high-demand regime spans ~20 periods (Periods 5\u201324). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm the observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to have the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the post-shift regime (captures the new higher level). Sigma also uses recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices keep base stock tuned to the confirmed longer-run high-demand regime while the large in-transit volume will reduce immediate ordering pressure.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 5 (large sustained increase); lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in multiple concluded messages. Current inventory (on-hand=79, in-transit=589 => pipeline=668) is large relative to typical (L+1) demand, so cap will limit orders; to keep service high while avoiding extra holding cost I explicitly set lead time to confirmed 4 and use recent demand statistics to reflect the post-changepoint regime. Chosen methods: L explicit=4 to lock in observed lead time; mu_hat recent_N=8 and sigma_hat recent_N=8 to base (1+L)-period demand and volatility on the most recent 8 post-shift samples (captures current elevated mean/variance and adapts if regime persists). This balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline and high holding cost equal to profit.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (much higher demand since). I set L=calculate to lock in observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This raises inventory targets to cover the higher demand while the large in-transit position reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. History shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with W=4). Demand shifted up sharply at Period 5 and has remained in the higher regime through Period 28. On-hand=160 + in-transit=546 => pipeline_inventory=706, which covers multiple weeks of elevated demand but some past orders were delayed earlier; using observed lead-time data and recent demand regime improves forecast. Set L to 'calculate' to lock to observed average lead time (4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while respecting the N cap; this biases the base-stock toward the recent higher mean and the OR cap calculation will limit order size to avoid excessive holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained jump to ~185/week). Current on-hand 330 + in-transit 260 = 590 units (ample cover vs recent weekly demand). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; no new lost-shipment signal. To focus the OR engine on the sustained high-demand regime, set L to promised (default) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime data using recent_N with N=20 (captures the last ~20 periods of the higher-demand regime and its volatility). This keeps service high while avoiding excessive extra safety stock beyond observed post-changepoint variability.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a persistent higher-demand regime since Period 5; no new sustained changepoint detected.

These parameters aim to size the (1+L)-period forecast to current elevated demand while avoiding excessive overstock given holding cost parity with profit.

Significant demand regime shift was observed starting Period 5 (large, sustained increase vs. early-sample mean). To reflect confirmed lead time I use calculate for L (avg observed lead times). To capture the sustained higher post-shift demand and recent volatility I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 (focus on recent/post-shift samples). This raises target base-stock to preserve service given profit=holding ($1/$1) while letting OR backend cap orders.

Recent demand has moderated from earlier spike; using recent data to capture current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 8 demand observations (Periods 26\u201333) so the OR backend adapts to the current lower-demand regime while accounting for the 4-period lead time and the need to cover L+1 periods of demand.

Current inventory: on-hand=49, in-transit=430 (pipeline=479) which already covers multiple (1+L) weeks of demand. To let the OR engine compute service-level-aware targets using the promised/confirmed lead time and historical demand statistics, I select default methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples and the promised lead time. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while respecting the confirmed L=4.

A sustained demand regime shift was detected starting Period 5 (2019-03-11) with much higher demand thereafter; use recent data from that regime to forecast. Set L by calculating average observed lead time (confirmed=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (regime length since Period 5 is >20, choose N=20 per rules) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples \u2014 this biases forecasts to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the current large pipeline reduces urgency and holding costs are high (profit=holding), so using recent regime statistics balances service vs inventory risk.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand); on-hand=209, in-transit=399 (pipeline substantial). Observed lead times have repeatedly concluded as 4 periods. To capture the post-changepoint demand distribution I use recent data rather than the small early samples: set L to promised (default=4), use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the sustained higher-demand regime), and use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline stock. No evidence of new lost shipments or lead-time shifts in concluded messages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=254, in-transit=350 (pipeline=604). Concluded history shows consistent observed lead_time=4; use lead-time estimate from observed data. Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime starting Period 5; to capture the post-shift higher mean/volatility I use a recent-window estimate to compute forecast across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Recent_N=20 balances responsiveness to the higher-demand regime while smoothing short noise, which raises target base_stock for service without extreme over-ordering given profit=holding. Sigma recent_N uses the same window to reflect current volatility for safety-stock sizing.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime that began at Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand vs. the small-sample historical Jan data). On-hand=272 + in-transit=340 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=612, so current coverage is large versus near-term demand; no lost shipments evident recently and lead time has been consistently observed as 4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-Period-5 high-demand regime when forecasting the (1+L) review+lead demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward servicing the confirmed high-demand regime while the OR backend caps order size to avoid excessive over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=375, in-transit=220. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 across multiple arrivals (confirming earlier insight). Inventory is currently high vs recent weekly demand, so use a recent-demand forecast to avoid overordering while respecting the confirmed lead time. Set L via calculate (backend will use observed lead times = 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing older extreme early samples. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend computes volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (accounting for 4-period lead time and recent demand) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period 5 (large, persistent increase); to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent data. Set L via calculate to let backend confirm observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures last 20 periods of elevated demand and volatility) to bias base stock toward recent higher mean and real variability, reducing stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (consistent across observed concludes). On-hand=474, in-transit=60 \u2192 pipeline covers several weeks so we can target lower replenishment aligned with recent lower demand. I set L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg of observed lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 30\u201341) where weekly demand averaged \u224875 units; mu_hat will thus reflect (1+L)\xd7recent mean to set base-stock near current demand levels. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances service (use recent demand and confirmed LT=4) against holding cost given on-hand inventory is already high.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent weekly demand has settled to a low post-peak regime (Periods 31\u201342 recent mean \u224869 units/week). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=464 and in-transit=10 \u2014 current inventory already covers multiple weeks, so parameters should reflect the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess ordering. I set L using observed lead times (calculate). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (captures the most recent stable demand regime, (1+L) weighting applied by backend). This keeps the base-stock aligned to current lower demand and limits new receipts while on-hand is high.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=459, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. Demand showed a large regime shift upward around Period 5 historically, but recent weekly demand (most recent ~20 periods) has fallen to a much lower level (recent weeks average \u224832 units/week). Given high on-hand inventory and low recent demand, I use the promised lead time and base my forecast on recent data (to avoid ordering into excess stock). Methods chosen: L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N using the last 20 samples to capture the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect current observed variability and keep safety stock appropriate to recent volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=436, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (multiple P conclude entries confirming 4); no new late/lost shipments. Recent demand has returned to modest weekly values (last several periods: 60,15,23). I choose L='calculate' to let backend confirm the empiric lead time from observed concludes (which are consistently 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the provided demand samples as its baseline; this is conservative given mixed early high-demand regime evidence and current moderate demand, and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations. These settings prioritize avoiding excess ordering given high holding cost equal to profit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=419, in-transit=89; strong inventory cushion vs recent low weekly demand (last 6 weeks: 15,23,17,0 arrivals then 89 ordered). Lead time historically observed = 4 periods; no new sustained lead-time change. Demand has shown large regime shifts earlier but recent weeks (Periods 40\u201345) show low demand, not a sustained new high. To avoid overstock given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 low service-level uplift), use observed lead time estimate and default demand estimates based on full sample history so backend's base_stock is conservative. Methods: infer L from observed lead times, keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this limits new ordering while on-hand + pipeline is already high.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=403, in-transit=97. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 (multiple P conclude messages). Recent demand (Periods 39\u201346) is low (range ~15\u201360, recent average ~28), well below the earlier high-regime. To avoid excess holding cost with profit=holding, I bias forecast to recent demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (reduces base stock and volatility input so orders shrink and holding cost is limited).
