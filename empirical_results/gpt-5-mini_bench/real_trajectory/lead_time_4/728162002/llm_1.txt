Recent 3-week average (Jan21-Feb04) \u224812.7; 5-week average \u224819.0. There is a downward shift from the early spike (36) toward ~12\u201316 in recent weeks; I will use a conservative forecast around 15 units/week. c) Lead time / orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. No prior conclude messages available to contradict this and no in-transit stock; treat actual lead time as unknown but assume 4 for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Any order placed now will not arrive until Period 5 (after four periods). There is no way to satisfy demand in Periods 1\u20134 with new stock. e) Order logic: Because holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), avoid large excess inventory. I choose to cover (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand to have stock once arrivals occur and to minimize stockouts thereafter. Using a conservative weekly demand = 15 \u2192 5*15 = 75 units. This balances service after the lead time against high holding cost.",

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30: post-Christmas period \u2014 apparel demand typically soft. Historical demand shows a sustained low regime since P39 (demands P39\u2013P46: 27,35,26,60,15,23,17,16; recent average \u224827/week). Prior carry-over already recorded that downshift. Lead time confirmed = 4 periods from earlier conclues; no shipments in-transit now. With L+1=5 periods coverage target, expected demand \u224827\xd75\u2248135 units. On-hand=199 > required coverage, and holding cost ($1/unit/period) equals profit so carrying excess inventory reduces reward. Therefore place no order to avoid additional holding cost.",
