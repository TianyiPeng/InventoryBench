{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 (evidence already in history). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=728 units. Demand context: recent weeks (Periods 43\u201345) show modest demand (110,113,95) after a one-off spike (506 at P42); longer-run regime previously recorded (Periods 5\u201315) increased mean to ~150.6/wk, but 728 in-transit still covers multiple weeks (728 / 150.6 \u2248 4.8 weeks). Cost tradeoff: profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period, so extra ending inventory directly reduces objective. OR recommended 77 units but used promised-L and historical mean; given large pipeline and confirmed LT=4, additional ordering risks unnecessary holding costs. Final strategy: do not order this period (0 units). Monitor upcoming concludes for actual arrivals and only resume ordering when pipeline + on-hand no longer cover (L+1) periods of expected demand or if demand shows sustained increase.",
