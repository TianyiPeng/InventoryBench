  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, year-end). Product = women's skinny denim; no obvious Dec/NYE spike\u2014demand likely normal-to-soft after holidays. Demand analysis: recent demands (P42-P46) = [506*,110,113,95,75]; P42 was a Black Friday spike (11/25) and is an outlier. Longer-run recent pre-spike weeks (P36-P41) ~156-182. Use conservative expected weekly demand \u2248120\u2013170. Lead time & pipeline: lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. In-transit=901 (ordered P43) will arrive during Period 47 (after decision) and be available for fulfillment in subsequent periods (visible in P47 conclude). Current on-hand=140 + in-transit=901 => pipeline supply \u22481041 units covering >> (L+1)=5 periods of demand even under high forecast. Cost tradeoff: Profit = $1/unit sold, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 extra inventory yields no margin after holding; avoid overstock. Final decision: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs; rely on incoming 901 and on-hand stock to meet demand.",
