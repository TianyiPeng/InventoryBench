Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover review+lead demand. No concluded arrivals exist yet so actual lead time is unknown. Use promised lead time (default L=4). Recent demand shows a jump in the last 3 samples (191,160,99) so I base demand forecast and volatility on those 3 most recent weeks to capture the higher recent regime while keeping sample size minimal: mu_hat -> recent_N N=3; sigma_hat -> recent_N N=3. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated recent demand while sigma from recent volatility sets safety stock to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=227 (order placed P1), and P1 conclude shows ordered=227 arrived=0 \u2014 consistent with promised lead time possibly >=1; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) as baseline. Choose L=default to keep the promised 4-period lead time (no confirmed deviation). Use mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures recent sample mean ~101.2 \xd75 =506 expected demand over review+lead). Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility. These conservative defaults ensure the OR engine orders to cover (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding premature adjustments for suspected lost/delayed shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 Period 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=466 (matches orders 227+239 from P1\u2013P2); no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred (promised L=4 still within window). Historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~101.2/week but high variance. I choose to use the default promised lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this keeps the baseline safety-stock calculation consistent until we observe any concluded arrivals or sustained demand/lead-time shifts. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods with current mean) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=648 (no arrivals have concluded yet). Historical demand samples: [20,36,191,160,99] (mean=101.2). All previous orders (Periods 1\u20133) show arrived=0 in concludes, so there is no concluded evidence to change promised lead time. Use default lead time (promised L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to the full sample set while the in-transit shipment status is unresolved and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=660 (from prior orders) but all concluded arrivals in Periods 1-4 show arrived=0 despite orders placed (ordered P1=227, P2=239, P3=182, P4=12). This indicates shipments have not concluded on the promised 4-period lead time and likely are delayed/lost; therefore I set an explicit longer lead time to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline coverage. I keep demand forecasting based on all historical samples (default) because available demand history (5 weekly samples mean=101.2) is limited but shows variability; default sigma uses all samples. These settings raise the target base-stock to prioritize service given current pipeline uncertainty while avoiding overfitting to very recent noisy signals.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals observed for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered totals 660 units) \u2014 probable lost/delayed shipments or actual lead time > promised 4 periods (sustained across 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent conclude shows Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 => actual lead time observed = 4 periods. There were earlier multi-period non-arrivals but now we have confirmation of 4-period lead time for at least one shipment. On-hand=76, in-transit=681. Use default lead time to match promised/now-confirmed 4. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) because historical sample set (5 weekly observations) is small but representative; this keeps OR backend forecasts stable while the system confirms whether earlier missing shipments were lost or delayed. Default sigma to reflect full-sample volatility. These settings prioritize balanced service (profit=holding cost) while avoiding over-reacting to transient missing-arrival signals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand=156, in-transit=442; recent concludes show orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=4, confirming actual LT=4. Recent demand (Periods 1-6) shows a higher regime (~150-216) than the older Jan samples. Set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in LT=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 demand observations, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime and preventing understock given confirmed 4-period lead time and equal profit/holding costs (service level priority).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 Period 8. On-hand=185, in-transit=473. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (arrivals from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Use observed lead-time awareness and recent demand regime (Periods 3\u20137 demand: 149,151,159,159,153) to set demand forecast. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect the most recent stable demand (~154/wk) across the review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock focused on recent realized demand and avoid overreacting to older low-volume samples while accounting for confirmed lead time and existing pipeline (reduces risk of excess holding given holding cost=profit).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime (~150-205/week) compared with the older small-sample (20-99). Observed arrivals in concluded periods consistently indicate a 4-period actual lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=574 (covers several future periods). Set L using calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations so the OR engine targets service for the current high-demand regime while avoiding excess stock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Historical weekly demand samples (20,36,191,160,99) give mean ~101.2. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P5 all arrived with W=4), so I rely on observed lead time. Current on-hand=83 and in-transit=529 => pipeline=612, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand under default forecast. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), use observed lead time averaging to reflect real supply timing and default demand estimates from all samples so the OR backend computes base-stock with full sample stats; with pipeline already above the default (1+L)*mean, we avoid aggressive extra ordering that would increase holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has been elevated and variable (last 6 concluded period demands: 151,159,153,205,165,121; mean\u2248159). On-hand=0, in-transit=649 (large pipeline arriving under confirmed 4-period lead times). No new evidence of lost shipments; observed lead time consistently 4. To balance service vs holding cost, set lead time estimate to observed average and base demand forecast on the recent 6-period regime so the OR backend sizes orders for the (1+L) review+lead horizon while reflecting the recent higher mean and volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand historical samples (mean=101.2/week) imply (1+L)=5 review+lead demand \u2248506 units. Current inventory (on-hand 94 + in-transit 582 = 676) exceeds the 5-period expected demand, so no upward adjustment needed. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies its baseline (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) while avoiding excess holdings given ample pipeline and confirmed LT.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=57, in-transit=508. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (orders consistently arrived after 4). Recent demand has moderated but remains higher than early-sample history; last 5 concluded demands = [205,165,121,119,150], mean=152. To cover review+lead (1+L) periods and reflect the recent regime, keep L at promised (confirmed as 4) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods. This balances service (covering 5 periods of demand with recent mean) while sigma is estimated from recent variability to avoid overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=122, in-transit=500 \u2192 pipeline=622. Observed lead times from concluded messages consistently equal 4 periods, so set L using observed average. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; using the most recent 5 demand samples focuses the forecast on the current regime. With L based on observed lead times and mu/sigma from recent_N (N=5), the OR engine will target (1+L)-period coverage using recent mean and volatility, helping balance service (avoid stockouts given ~138.6 recent mean) versus holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) mean ~101.2 units; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon =5 periods \u2192 default (1+L)*mean provides a baseline demand forecast. Current inventory: on-hand=106, in-transit=451 \u2192 pipeline=557 units, which broadly covers ~5-period expected demand (~506) so no urgent catch-up ordering required. Use default estimators to let OR backend apply its base-stock/cap logic while preserving protection against variance and holding cost tradeoffs. No new sustained anomalies warranting carry-over updates.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 showed arrival of Period 1 order after 4 periods and subsequent arrivals align with 4). On-hand=92, in-transit=462 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand covers several future periods but some past late-arrival concerns resolved by confirming L=4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed). Demand estimate uses default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample statistics; this balances service (profit=holding => q=0.5) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. This approach acknowledges earlier delayed arrivals but relies on confirmed lead-time evidence and full-sample demand stats.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=16, in-transit=587. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1..P12 arrived after 4 periods). Pipeline is large (587) but arrivals are observed with 4-period lag; no new sustained demand regime detected. To let the OR engine use its promised-lead-time model and full-sample demand stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so base-stock uses all historical samples and the engine's cap constraint.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Lead time confirmed as 4 periods from history (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 and repeated confirmations); use promised/default L. Recent demand regime is materially higher than the small Jan samples: demands since Period 5 are consistently elevated (periods 5\u201317: 151,159,153,205,165,121,119,150,138,136,160,115,86) indicating a sustained higher mean. I therefore use a recent_N forecast for demand (capture the recent regime) with N=13 (periods 5\u201317). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the newer higher demand while the OR backend will cap orders to avoid extreme over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Pipeline plus on-hand appears sufficient short-term. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT=4. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to leverage full historical samples and avoid overreacting to short-term noise, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) averaged ~112 units/week; on-hand=154 + in-transit=463 provides ample coverage vs promised lead time. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default to keep OR engine aligned. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (most recent 5 periods) so the base-stock reflects recent lower demand and reduces excess holding while maintaining service.

Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed arrive after 4 periods). No evidence of a new demand regime or sustained volatility shift. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and full historical demand, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) without introducing ad-hoc adjustments despite past delayed shipments now resolved.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1..P18 arrived after 4 periods); pipeline looks healthy (no new lost shipments since earlier anomaly). Demand over the recent selling periods (P5\u2013P22) averages ~135 units/week with moderate variability. I set L using observed data (calculate) to force backend to use realized lead time. I use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1). This keeps safety stock modest while covering expected 5-period exposure (review+lead).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has settled at a lower, stable level (~100\u2013160/week). On-hand 86 + in-transit 525 = 611 units which roughly covers (1+L)=5 future weeks at recent demand. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent data (reduces influence of the early high spikes). I choose N=12 (recent 12 concluded periods) as a balance between responsiveness and noise; this will help the OR backend size base-stock to meet service goals while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=193, in-transit=355. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; some earlier multi-period gaps were resolved (Period 6 confirmed LT=4). Pipeline + on-hand adequate but demand uncertainty exists; use default lead time and demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample history for (1+L) demand and volatility. This balances service (profit=holding, equal) by relying on backend's base-stock calculation rather than forcing aggressive top-up given existing inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (most concluded orders: lead_time=4); no sustained demand regime shift detected. I choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time, and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample history to set base-stock and cap. This balances service level (use observed LT=4) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=189, in-transit=299 (pipeline total=488) which covers ~5 periods at recent demand rates. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 repeatedly, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 106,58,63,105,153) shows higher variability and a recent uptick (especially Period 27=153) vs earlier weeks; I therefore use a recent_N forecast to capture the current regime. Choose N=5 (most recent 5 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base-stock for (1+L) periods using the current mean and volatility. This balances service (capture the recent uptick) against holding cost given profit=holding so service/holding tradeoff is symmetric.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=151, in-transit=198. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. I therefore use the promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 58, 63, 105, 153, 139) shows a lower recent mean (~103.6) than the long-run; to be responsive to the recent regime I set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 5 samples. Volatility will use the default (all-sample) estimate. These choices keep L aligned with observed reality, reduce forecast bias by emphasizing recent demand, and let the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost with an updated mean while retaining a conservative sigma estimate.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) shows higher mean and variability (demands: 63,105,153,139,162) so forecast and volatility should reflect this regime to avoid stockouts while capping holding. Chosen L='calculate' to lock to observed lead time=4; mu_hat='recent_N' N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

Recent demand has jumped in the last 2 weeks (Period 30=282, Period 31=289) \u2014 I treat this as a new higher regime but require short-window smoothing. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (captures the most recent regime: Periods 29-31 = 162,282,289) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 3) to reflect the spike and avoid under-ordering; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given surge) vs holding cost by reacting quickly to the apparent uptick while using a short N to avoid overreacting to noise.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (focus on the last 3 high-demand samples). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while sigma from recent periods sets safety stock to balance service vs. holding costs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has jumped sharply in the last 4 periods (P30\u2013P33: 282, 289, 266, 455). Lead time history consistently shows 4-period arrivals; no new evidence of lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=1132 (covers multiple review+lead periods). I set L=default to use the promised/observed 4-period lead time. To capture the recent demand regime shift, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (focus on P30\u2013P33) so the backend forecasts higher (1+L)-period demand and adjusts variability accordingly, improving service during this sustained spike while letting the capped order cap limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand P30\u2013P33 = 323 units vs prior avg P1\u2013P29 \u2248 150 units (+115%), sustained for 4 periods.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1409 (large pipeline from recent orders). Promised lead time=4 and multiple conclude messages confirm actual LT=4. To capture the new high-demand regime I set L to default (use promised 4) and forecast demand using the most recent 4 periods (the detected regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

I set L using calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time (captures confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (regime length since P30 = 6) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean over the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture elevated recent volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (P30\u2013P36 elevated vs P1\u2013P29). On-hand=237, in-transit=1092 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand remains elevated. Actual observed lead times consistently 4 periods; promised lead time is 4. I keep L=default (use promised 4). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, averaging the most recent 7 periods (P30\u2013P36) to reflect the sustained shift and reduce dilution from prior low-demand history. This raises the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new regime while sigma from recent data informs safety stock. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments are needed because arrivals confirm lead time=4 and in-transit is large.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; demand regime shifted up starting Period 30 (P30\u2013P37 show sustained higher demand vs P1\u2013P29). On-hand=354 + in-transit=852 (total pipeline 1,206) provides cover, but because the post-changepoint regime is materially higher, I use recent data from the new regime for demand estimates. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (P30\u2013P37) to capture the higher mean and volatility since the changepoint. These choices bias orders toward higher service (higher base_stock) appropriate for the sustained demand increase while relying on observed lead time evidence to avoid under-ordering due to delays.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 30 (sustained); recent 9-period average demand \u2248256/week. Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand 645 + in-transit 505 = 1,150 units \u2014 this roughly covers ~4.5 weeks of current demand but we must replenish for (1+L)=5-period coverage. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times (confirms 4); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=9) to reflect the sustained higher mean and observed variability. No new sustained lead-time or regime changes to record.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows observed lead time consistently 4 periods (many concluded arrivals: orders placed Pn arrived Pn+4). Demand regime shift at P30\u2013P33 was previously recorded and remains relevant; current on-hand=650, in-transit=473 (healthy coverage). No evidence of new sustained demand or lead-time change. I use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times ~4) and default demand moments so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L); default sigma lets backend compute volatility across all samples. This keeps service high given elevated recent demand while avoiding unnecessary extra explicit adjustments.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 30 (avg demand P30\u2013P33 and onward much higher than earlier). On-hand=643, in-transit=310 provides strong immediate coverage; promised lead time=4 has been consistently observed. To capture the post-Period-30 demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 11 periods (regime length ~11). Using default lead time keeps promised L=4 for the OR engine while mu/sigma reflect the new higher-demand regime and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 30 (P30\u2013P33 avg \u2248323 vs prior \u2248150) and has persisted through recent periods; observed lead times in concluded history consistently 4 periods. On-hand 531 + in-transit 493 provides substantial pipeline cover but recent higher demand warrants larger review+lead forecast. Set L by averaging observed lead times (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change demand regime (P30\u2013P41) so the base-stock targets reflect the higher mean and variability, balancing service-level (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning ~Period 30 (higher weekly demand sustained through Period 42). Current inventory: on-hand=147, in-transit=514 (total pipeline=661). Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4. Given the clear, sustained higher-demand regime, raise forecast to reflect recent samples rather than long-run mean: set L to default (use promised 4), set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the new regime, and set sigma_hat using recent_N to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service during the elevated-demand regime while the backend will cap orders per its policy.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time observations consistently show 4-period arrivals. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) and set demand estimates using recent data from the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and volatility. I select recent_N with N=14 (regime length P30\u2013P43 = 14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand while limiting noise from older low-demand periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than all-history averages.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 30 (carry-over: avg P30\u2013P33 \u2248323 vs prior \u2248150). On-hand=53, in-transit=1054 \u2192 pipeline=1107, which is large but some previously-placed orders have long lead confirmation patterns. I set L by "calculate" to let the backend use observed lead-times (historical concludes consistently show 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the post-changepoint higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; N=15 captures multiple weeks of the new regime without overfitting isolated peaks. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid lost sales in the new, elevated-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N informs safety-stock sizing to balance holding cost vs stockouts.
