Recent 3-week average = 16.7 units/week vs earlier average ~1.0; demand appears to have shifted up. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet (no in-transit), so cannot confirm actual lead time or losses. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so no coverage for current or upcoming demand. e) Order logic: With promised L=4, we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using a conservative forecast of ~30 units for the next week (extrapolating recent trend) and assuming similar weekly demand over the next 5 weeks, place order = 5 * 30 = 150 units.
