I weight recent regime more heavily: last two weeks average = 258.5/week; five-week average = 129.8. To avoid stockouts given the sharp recent increase and low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit), I target coverage for 5 periods at ~260 units/week => order 1,300 units. This provides safety versus underordering if the high-demand regime persists; monitor arrivals/concludes to confirm lead time or lost shipments.",
