{
  "rationale": "Lead time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (carry-over insight). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=478 (these in-transit units will arrive over upcoming periods per observed 4-period lead time). Recent demand spike around Dec (periods 43-46: 148,65,90,233,214) is noisy but concentrated; however we already have large pipeline. OR recommends 217 using promised L and historical averages. Given large existing pipeline (478) and confirmed L=4, placing another order now would only increase holding cost without immediately improving availability (new units arrive after 4 periods). Therefore I will not place additional orders this period and let pipeline clear/arrive first; reassess next period with observed concludes to allocate replacements if needed.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No new order \u2014 confirmed lead time=4 and substantial pipeline (478 units) makes OR's 217 unnecessary now; avoid extra holding cost and reassess after upcoming arrivals.",
