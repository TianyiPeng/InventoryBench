  "rationale": "World/calendar: period date 2019-12-30 (holiday season) can drive high demand; product is women\u2019s tights (seasonally relevant). Demand analysis: recent 5-period demand (P42\u2013P46) = {355,197,319,475,462}, avg \u2248361.6/wk. Lead time & pipeline: actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods; in-transit=1480 units equals outstanding orders from P43\u2013P46 scheduled to arrive across Periods 47\u201350 (440, 44, 374, 622). Decision rule (cover L+1=5 periods of demand): required coverage \u2248361.6\xd75 \u22481810 units. Current on-hand(0)+in-transit(1480)=1480 \u2192 short \u2248330 units. Holding vs profit: holding cost = $1/period equals profit $1/unit, so avoid excess inventory. Order enough to cover pipeline shortfall but not much more. Final order: 330 units.",
