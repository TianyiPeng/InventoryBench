{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas week) \u2014 typical short-term dip in retail apparel demand. Product fits everyday womens trousers (no strong seasonal spike at year-end).

Lead time & pipeline: historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods. Current on-hand = 68, in-transit = 230 \u2192 pipeline total = 298 units. Forecast & policy: use L+1 = 5 periods coverage. Target coverage = 5 * forecast \u2248 5 * 30 = 150 units.
