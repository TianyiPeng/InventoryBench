======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time (Period1\u2192P5 etc.), so promised L=4 is confirmed. Inventory & demand: on-hand = 490, in-transit = 0. Recent demands (P43\u2013P46 = 59,103,94,79) show a holiday spike but average recent weekly demand \u224884; even using the higher confirmed regime (mean \u2248150 from P14-era) the on-hand covers multiple weeks. Cost tradeoff: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 carrying extra inventory is costly and risks negative contribution. OR recommended 0 units; given confirmed L=4 and large on-hand buffer (\u2248490 units) I will not order to avoid additional holding cost and to allow inventory to deplete to a more reasonable level before replenishing. Final strategy: place 0 order now; monitor arrivals/concluded messages for any lost shipments or a sustained upward demand signal (require \u22653 periods) before ordering again.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 on-hand 490 units provides ample cover versus recent demand spikes and holding cost equals profit, so avoid adding inventory; follow OR's 0 recommendation.",
