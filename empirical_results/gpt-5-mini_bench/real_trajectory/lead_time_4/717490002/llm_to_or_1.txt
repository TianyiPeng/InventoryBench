Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean \u224839.4 units/wk; no on-hand or in-transit inventory. Promised lead time = 4 periods and no concluded arrivals to suggest a different lead time. I choose default lead time to trust the promise. Demand forecast uses all samples (no evidence of a sustained regime change) so mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean) and demand variability uses all samples so sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (covering current + L future periods) vs holding cost given modest variance and no signal of increased demand or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand 0, in-transit 45 (order placed Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet; no confirmed lead-time change. Historical weekly demand mean = 39.4 (five samples). Promised lead time remains the best estimate. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This maintains service level based on full-sample demand while avoiding premature adjustments for an unconfirmed delayed shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (two prior orders of 45). No concluded arrivals yet beyond Periods 1\u20132 (arrived=0), so insufficient evidence to change lead-time estimate. Use promised lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019: 42,40,35,42,38) give a stable baseline (mean\u224839.4); use default demand/volatility scaling for (1+L) review+lead window so the OR backend computes base_stock from long-run stats. This balances service level (covers multi-period demand) against holding cost given limited evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=141; no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed remain unconfirmed). Historical weekly samples (Jan) mean\u224839.4; recent observed demand in concluded periods: P1=32, P2=51, P3=61 showing a sustained upward shift. I keep L as promised (default) because no concluded arrivals to reliably infer a different lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the higher recent demand regime ((32+51+61)/3=48) scaled by (1+L) in backend. I set sigma_hat recent_N=3 to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service given rising demand while keeping lead time assumption conservative until arrivals conclude.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent Periods 1-3 avg=48 vs prior sample avg\u224839.4 (+21.8%); treat as new regime (3 consecutive periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=214. Recent observed demands (Periods 2-4) show elevated demand versus prior baseline (consecutive higher weeks: 51,61,47). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm lead-time shift; use promised lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent 3 demand observations (N=3). Volatility also appears higher recently, so use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping L at promised until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=1, in-transit=234 (large pipeline but recent arrivals confirmed: Period1 order arrived after 4 periods -> actual lead time=4). Historical demand samples: [32,51,61,47,44]; recent regime identified (3-period shift) justifies using the last 3 periods to forecast. I set L by calculation to capture observed lead time (backend will average observed lead times -> 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to respond to the confirmed higher-demand regime (keeps (1+L) scaling on most recent behavior and reduces dilution from older, lower-demand samples). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=225. Observed concluded lead times: two arrivals show lead_time=4 (orders P1->P5, P2->P6). Prior carry-over found a demand regime shift (3 consecutive periods) so I emphasize recent demand. I set L="calculate" to use observed lead times (avg=4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new regime (use last 3 demands: 47,44,84 => mean\u224858.33; (1+L)=5 => target \u2248291.7 units across review+lead). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets the higher recent demand while using observed lead time and recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost. I note pipeline (225) will be used by backend when computing final order.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=269. Concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1-3 arrived with lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) so actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand has jumped: Periods 5-7 demands = [44,84,150], indicating a new high-demand regime; use a short recent window to capture current mean/volatility. Set L by calculate to lock in observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures periods 5-7). This increases target base_stock to cover the higher demand while reflecting higher demand variability for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: recent Periods 5-7 avg=92.67 vs prior sample avg\u224839.4 (+135%); treat as new high-demand regime (3 consecutive periods).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Observed actual lead times in conclude messages: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8 => actual lead time confirmed = 4. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (recent demands P5\u2013P8 = 44,84,150,118; recent avg \u224899). On-hand=0, in-transit=377 which should cover several upcoming periods but demand remains elevated so I use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the new regime. Choices: L by calculate to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat recent_N to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 4 high-demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N to capture volatility of the same 4-sample regime. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service under the confirmed high-demand regime while sigma_hat inflates safety stock to balance holding cost given on-hand=0 and large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Observed concluded lead times for arrivals are consistently 4 periods (orders placed P1-P5 all arrived with W=4). Recent demand shows a high-demand regime emerge around Periods 5-8; most recent 3 concluded demands (Periods 7-9 = 150,118,64) suggest using a short recent window to capture current volatility and elevated mean. Set L via calculate to lock in observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using the most recent regime evidence, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 for six observed orders (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10). Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime starting around Period 5 (periods 5-10 demands = 44,84,150,118,64,66; recent 6-period mean \u224887.67 vs prior sample mean \u224839.4). To capture the confirmed lead time I use the calculated average; to reflect the new high-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 6 demand observations for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods under the new regime while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (multiple weeks with demand >> historical ~40s). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated lead time. On-hand=19 and in-transit=504 (ample pipeline), but demand remains elevated; therefore set demand forecast using recent data to reflect the new regime (last 6 observed demand periods: P6\u2013P11 = 84,150,118,64,66,76). Choose recent_N N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current higher mean and volatility while backend cap limits orders and promised lead time is respected.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Observed concluded lead times for arrivals (Periods 5-12) are consistently 4 periods \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand has moved to a higher regime since Period 5 (notable spikes Periods 5-8, then elevated but variable demand Periods 9-12). On-hand=124, in-transit=330 provides substantial pipeline cover; however elevated recent demand argues using a recent-sample forecast to capture the new regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (last 8 periods of demand: Periods 5-12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent elevated regime, balancing service (higher mu_hat) vs holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Observed lead times from concluded messages consistently 4 periods \u2192 use calculate to confirm L. Recent demand (Periods 11-13 = 76,76,39) shows a new lower recent average (mean=63.67) after prior high-demand spike; choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current regime. With L=calculate (\u22484) the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; recent_N forecast (5\xd763.67\u2248318.3) is well covered by current pipeline (on-hand+in-transit=449), so parameters favor avoiding excess new orders while maintaining service for the current regime.

Observed concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = promised 4, so use default promised L to keep OR engine aligned. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the most recent post-spike regime (captures reduced mean and volatility vs the earlier spike). This keeps base-stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=291, in-transit=41. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). I keep L as default (promised=4). Recent demand has moderated versus earlier spikes; to focus the forecast on the latest behavior I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples. sigma_hat kept as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (use recent demand mean) while avoiding overreacting to older high-volatility spikes; default sigma prevents understating uncertainty given past large swings.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period 17. Observed arrivals in concluded history consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1-P12 arrived after 4 periods) so use calculated actual L. Recent demand remains in the higher regime identified at Period 8 (sustained elevated demand); to be responsive use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent demand volatility: Periods 14-16 demands 54,63,108). This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean responsive to elevated demand while sigma reflects recent variability, helping the OR backend raise base stock for service but limit excess holding given current on-hand=190 and in-transit=66.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand remains in higher regime (post-Period 8): last 3 realized demands = [63,108,84], mean=85.0. On-hand=140, in-transit=155 => pipeline=295, which is below (1+L)*forecasted mean for L=4 (5*85=425) so backend must replenish. Lead times observed consistently = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (recommended N=3 as regime length=3). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures the short-term volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14, P12->P16, P13->P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been elevated vs the original 2019-Jan samples; most recent 3 periods (P16-18: 108,84,72) suggest a new high-demand regime (avg\u224888). On-hand=68 + in-transit=278 = 346 units; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods, so targeting recent demand reduces stockout risk while limiting holding cost. No evidence of new lost shipments; historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4. I set L to default (use promised lead time), use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand short-run regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time=4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand shifted to a sustained higher regime beginning around Period 8 (recent periods show much higher weekly demand). To respect confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime, set L to default (promised 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=12 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 12 periods (captures the post-changepoint high demand since P8). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while limiting excess inventory by using recent-sample estimates rather than the long-run low-demand mean.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent demand has jumped sharply: Periods 19-22 demands = [100,105,393,264] (avg=215.5), well above the prior high-demand regime (~92.67). On-hand=0, in-transit=625 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will arrive over coming periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To capture the new high-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and existing pipeline, I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent 4 weeks (captures the current surge). I set sigma_hat to recent_N=4 to reflect the elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices increase target base-stock to meet the new higher demand while the sigma estimate raises safety stock; existing large in-transit inventory will moderate immediate orders and prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: recent Periods 19-22 avg=215.5 vs prior regime avg\u224892.67 (+133%), treat as new high-demand regime (4 consecutive periods).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows a confirmed lead time of 4 and a new high-demand regime established around Period 23 (recent regime length = 4 with avg \u2248215.5). On-hand=45, in-transit=953 (large pipeline). To respect promised lead time and recent demand regime, keep L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast to the newest high-demand regime and capture recent volatility; this focuses the OR engine on current demand while letting its capped ordering limit temper orders given the large pipeline and holding cost (profit=4, holding=1 implies high service level but avoid overstocking).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime identified at Period 23 (Periods 19-22 avg=215.5 units/week); recent volatility is high. On-hand=0, in-transit=1249 (~249 units/week coverage over (1+L)=5 weeks) which roughly matches recent demand. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history. Therefore use promised/default lead time to remain consistent with observed arrivals, and use recent_N (N=4 = Periods 19-22) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to the new high-demand regime while accounting for observed variability. This keeps service (meets elevated demand) without overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=2, In-transit=1243. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and multiple demand regime shifts, most recently Period 19-22 high-demand regime (avg\u2248215.5). Pipeline is large so risk of excess holding but service level must cover elevated demand. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (capture the recent high-demand regime, periods 19-22) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this targets higher fill rates during the sustained high-demand regime while the cap limits over-ordering given current pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 Period 28. Inventory on-hand=506, in-transit=421. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has been variable; last 4 realized demands (Periods 24-27) = [128,99,227,91], mean=136.25 indicating current regime lower than the prior high 215.5. To be responsive to the most recent regime while respecting the promised lead time, use L=default (promised 4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 periods (N=4) so the backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the current regime. This balances service (capture recent demand uptick at Period 26) against holding costs given high on-hand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). On-hand=750, in-transit=95 \u2014 no overdue/lost shipments signaled. Demand entered a higher regime starting Period 23; I use recent data from that regime to capture current elevated mean/variance. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime since Period 23 covers 6 most recent periods), so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 6 demand samples, balancing service level for higher demand against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=652, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=4 (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Recent demand (Periods 26-29 = 227,91,82,193) is volatile and below the earlier peak regime (avg\u2248215.5 from P19-22). To capture the most recent demand level and variance I use recent_N=4 (the last 4 observed demands) for both demand mean and volatility. I use calculate for L so the backend confirms the observed lead time (should be 4). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent lower/volatile demand while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time, balancing service (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1) by sizing safety stock from recent variability rather than older extreme peaks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Observed lead times historically confirm 4 periods; maintain promised lead time. Recent demand remains elevated vs original sample; use recent_N to capture current high-demand regime (most recent 4 demand observations: P27-30 = 91,82,193,223). This helps the OR backend size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand while sigma estimated from same recent window captures increased volatility and avoids underordering given in-transit=227 and on-hand=429.

Recent demand elevated and variable; using last 5 demands (Periods 27-31: 91,82,193,223,135) gives a focused forecast for the current high-demand regime. Set L via calculate to rely on observed lead-times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand and captures recent volatility while avoiding stale low-demand history. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting the averaging window to recent data.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has softened vs the earlier high regime (last 4 demands: P29-32 = 193,223,135,103; recent avg=163.5), so I use a short recent window to capture the new downward trend while keeping lead time at promised 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to reflect current demand regime; L uses default (promised=4). This balances service (using recent higher demands when needed) against holding cost given already-large pipeline inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 30-33 = 223,135,103,172) shows a softer but still elevated regime vs original samples; I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current short-run level while keeping lead time at the confirmed promise. Choose L=default to keep promised/confirmed LT=4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=4 to reflect the most recent four weeks' demand pattern and volatility so the OR engine sizes orders to the near-term observed demand while accounting for the large pipeline inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). History shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). Current on-hand=153, in-transit=643. Recent demand (Periods 30-34) = [223,135,103,172,93] \u2014 demand has come down from earlier peaks but remains volatile. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead times (confirmed \u22484). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (most relevant for the upcoming (1+L) review+lead window). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the backend targets a base-stock tuned to the most recent demand level while acknowledging the confirmed 4-period lead time and current large pipeline, balancing service with holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=310, in-transit=459. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 30-35 = [223,135,103,172,93,58], avg=130.67 over 6 periods) is substantially below the earlier high-demand regime (\u2248215.5). To avoid overstock from prior high regime while protecting service, set L by calculation from observed lead times (confirms 4). Forecast demand using recent_N over last 6 samples (captures the recent downshift); volatility estimated from the same recent window to reflect current variability. These parameters reduce orders relative to the earlier high-regime policy and lower holding costs given large on-hand + in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: recent Periods 30-35 avg=130.67 vs prior regime avg\u2248215.5 (-39%), treat as new lower-demand regime (6 consecutive periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; demand has shifted down in recent periods (regime noted at P36: avg of P30-35 \u2248130.7, then P36=35 suggests continued softening). Current on-hand=380 + in-transit=354 provides ample pipeline. I set L=calculate to confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (all observed =4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to target the most recent lower-demand regime (captures P30-35 pattern); this produces (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the lower-demand regime while using confirmed lead time to avoid over-ordering given high current inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand regime shifted down around Period 36 (regime length = 6 periods); current on-hand (505) + in-transit (172) is already high, so avoid inflating targets. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime ((1+L)-period demand based on last 6 samples). Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock aligned to the currently lower demand and prevents excess ordering given large on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=593, in-transit=31. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last 5 periods (Periods 34-38 demands = 93,58,35,57,53; recent avg \u224859.2), so use a short recent-window forecast to reflect current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost. Set L to promised/confirmed lead time (4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level and volatility; this reduces target base stock vs older high-demand regimes and limits holding cost while maintaining service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=587, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show lead_time=4; use observed lead-time calculation. Recent demand has fallen from mid-year peaks \u2014 last 10 concluded demands (Periods 30-39) average \u224896.6 units; using a recent-N forecast captures this new lower-demand regime and reduces extra holding given large on-hand. I select L by calculating from observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=10 to adapt to the most recent demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent concluded demand (Periods 36-40 = 35,57,53,37,57) shows a lower recent mean (~47.8) compared with earlier high regimes; inventory is high (on-hand 530 + in-transit 15 = 545). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given large on-hand, I use a recent-N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower-demand regime; set L via calculate to lock confirmed lead time=4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=420, in-transit=15. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed previously). Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained 3+ period regime shift since Period 36. Use promised/default lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample history; this balances service level given confirmed L=4 while avoiding overfitting to recent noise and limiting holding cost with available high on-hand stock.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=258, in-transit=189 (total pipeline=447) which currently covers many periods of demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; I keep L as promised to match the backend. Recent demand (Periods 39-42 = 37,57,110,162) shows a new short-run regime; I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the latest demand level and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These parameters keep orders responsive to the most recent demand while the large on-hand+pipeline stock reduces risk of immediate stockouts.

Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 37,57,110,162,42) shows elevated and volatile short-run demand; I therefore forecast using the last 5 periods. With L based on observed lead time, mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep the OR engine responsive to the recent demand spike while letting the cap limit overly-large single orders given holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent observed lead times have been consistently 4 periods (carry-over records). On-hand=146, in-transit=310 provides substantial pipeline cover vs recent demand; no new sustained demand regime or lead-time change detected in the last 3 periods (demands 42,34,51 are low but not yet a 3+ period sustained regime shift beyond existing records). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed lead time and long-run demand history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to short noisy drops and leverages confirmed LT=4 evidence for replenishment timing.
