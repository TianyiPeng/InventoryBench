  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year) \u2014 typical subdued demand for basic T-shirt. Demand analysis: recent demands P43\u2013P46 = [42,34,51,40], mean \u224841.8 units/period (4 periods). Historical regime notes show prior high-demand regimes earlier in year, but last 4 periods indicate a sustained drop. Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from history; in-transit=294 (this is the order placed in P43 and will arrive during Period 47 after decision). Inventory assessment: on-hand=89 + in-transit=294 => pipeline+on-hand = 383 units. Coverage requirement: with L=4 we must cover next L+1=5 periods. Forecast demand \u224842 => 5-period demand \u2248210 units. Decision logic: pipeline+on-hand (383) comfortably exceeds 5-period demand (210); avoid ordering to reduce holding cost while meeting service. Final action: place 0 units.",
