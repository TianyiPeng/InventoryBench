{
  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=13, in-transit=320. Demand outlook: recent weeks (Periods 43\u201346) average ~41.8/week; using L=4 gives 5-period demand \u2248209. OR recommended 207 but OR ignores current pipeline; pipeline (320) already comfortably exceeds the ~209 5-period demand plus on-hand. Ordering more would raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit is $4. Therefore place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost and let in-transit stock satisfy upcoming demand.",
