Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand sequence: 51, 64, 75, 99, 145 showing a clear upward shift in the last 3 samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) future weeks. I set L to promised (default=4) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (samples 75,99,145) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to protect service during an apparent sustained demand increase while keeping variance estimate tied to recent observations to avoid overstock from older low-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg=106.33 vs earlier avg~57.5 (\u2248+85%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent historical demand shows a sustained upward regime detected earlier (Period 1 note) but no new arrival confirmations yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=165 (order placed Period 1) which has not concluded; promised lead time is 4 so arrival expected later \u2014 no evidence to revise lead time. To balance service vs holding cost with profit=holding, use default statistical estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance and promised L. This keeps parameters conservative given limited concluded evidence and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded; promised lead time=4 so arrivals are not overdue). Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (3-week avg \u2248106.3 vs earlier \u224857.5). To capture this higher regime while respecting the promised lead time, keep L as default (use promised L=4) so OR backend assumes standard lead time, and use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the new higher mean and variability. Chosen mu_hat=recent_N (N=3) lets base_stock reflect (1+L)\xd7recent mean, improving service during the higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=3) captures recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): on-hand=0, in-transit=469. Recent demand elevated vs earlier (carry-over noted starting 2019-01-21). No concluded arrivals yet so do not assume lost shipments; keep promised lead time. Use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the higher recent regime (use last 6 samples to balance the older baseline and recent weeks). Keep sigma default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). This raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while not overreacting to single-week noise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=542. No concluded arrivals observed yet (concludes through Period 4 show arrived=0), so do not change promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent higher samples); use recent_N=3 to capture the elevated mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead demand estimate. This balances service (capture recent uplift) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=98, in-transit=377. Period history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 => actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 1-5 = 113,124,94,94,67) indicates a higher recent mean than older historical samples; previous carry-over noted a regime shift starting 2019-01-21 sustained for 3+ periods. To reflect the confirmed lead time and emphasize recent demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent five observations, improving service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived Period5);

Daily Reward (R_t): $-57.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Observed on-hand=152, in-transit=245; concluded lead times show orders arriving after 4 periods (evidence in Periods 5\u20136). Demand has a sustained higher regime starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg \u2248106.3). To match confirmed lead time accuracy, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent volatility. This raises the (1+L)-period forecast to cover the 5-period pipeline and favors service level given profit=holding (q=0.5 => neutral z), while recent_N volatility limits over-ordering under capped order policy.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=174, in-transit=120. Historical concluded lead time evidence confirms actual L=4 (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand shows a higher regime since 2019-01-21; last 3 concluded demands = 67,95,133 (3-period avg \u224898.3) which I use to capture the recent elevated demand while limiting noise from older low-demand weeks. Use default lead time (promised 4) and recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock to the most-relevant recent regime and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (recent weeks: 95,133,106); on-hand=141, in-transit=200. Observed arrivals confirm lead times of 4 in concluded history. To keep the policy responsive to the recent higher-demand regime, set L to the observed average and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 3 realized demands while the OR backend scales by (1+L). This balances service (cover higher recent demand) versus holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Observed actual lead times consistently 4 periods (concluded P5\u2013P8). On-hand=60, in-transit=344 \u2192 pipeline_inventory=404 which covers multiple periods of demand. I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4). Demand shows a higher recent regime vs early history; to capture recent demand level I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (focus on last 5 demand observations) and for sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward current demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding parity.

Use calculated lead time from observations; set demand forecast and volatility using recent data (most recent 6 concluded demand periods: Periods 5\u201310) to reflect the post-shift regime while the large pipeline reduces urgency to order more now. These params balance service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

Actual lead time repeatedly observed =4. Use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive; this prevents overstocking from older low-demand samples while reflecting current volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=68, in-transit=281. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21. To reflect confirmed lead time evidence use calculate for L. To capture the recent elevated demand profile and variance, use recent_N with N=8 (covering the last 8 demand observations from Periods 5-12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate for the sustained higher-demand regime while balancing service level against equal profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=146, in-transit=237. Recent demand has been moderate (last 5 demands: 81,76,74,85,66). No new sustained lead-time or demand-pattern changes since prior insights. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep pipeline coverage aligned. Set mu_hat using recent 5-week mean to capture the current lower-demand regime; set sigma_hat from recent 5 weeks to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock focused on recent demand to avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=166, in-transit=159; pipeline+on-hand comfortably covers near-term but recent demand has trended down from spring peak. Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple P conclude messages). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (effectively 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 observed demand periods show a downward drift vs earlier peak), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime and reduce ordering vs older high-demand samples. This balances service (capture recent demand) while avoiding excess holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit/period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=160, in-transit=200. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4 (multiple orders arrived after 4 periods). Recent demand (Periods 13-15) averaged \u224863 units/week (66,58,65) \u2014 demand has moderated from the earlier Jan spike. To reflect observed LT stability I use calculated LT (uses observed concludes). To keep orders responsive to the most recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (captures immediate 3-period average and volatility \u224863 mean), which keeps base-stock tight (reduces holding given equal profit/holding) while protecting against near-term demand variability and covering (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly), pipeline + on-hand (280 units) is ample versus recent weekly demand (~60\u2013135). No sustained new demand or lead-time changepoint since prior insights. Use default lead time and population-wide demand stats so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so set L to calculated average of observed lead times.

Recent demand samples show no new sustained regime shift beyond the earlier Jan shift. Pipeline + on-hand (394 units) comfortably covers several weeks of demand. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

On-hand=103, in-transit=285 (pipeline coverage looks healthy). I use L=default (promised lead time = 4, supported by confirmations). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current lower-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples. For volatility I use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base_stock focused on recent demand to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service with the confirmed LT=4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=213, in-transit=155. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple period arrivals match promised). Recent demand has been low (Periods 18-21 demands: 51,33,28,20) and inventory is ample versus near-term demand; no new sustained demand or lead-time shift detected. To avoid overreacting to short-term noise, use default lead time and demand-statistics: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock computation grounded in full-sample estimates, balancing service-level targets against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and confirmed lead time.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I select L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while keeping service coverage for the 5-period review+lead window.

Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=265, in-transit=104; recent weekly demand has been moderate-to-low (last 8 demands: 12,58,33,20,28,33,51,65) with no new sustained regime shift. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 in history; use promised/default. To keep orders responsive to recent demand while limiting holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 (captures the most recent summer demand pattern).

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=235, in-transit=104. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4; pipeline looks healthy but recent weeks show lower summer demand versus the earlier high-winter regime, so use recent demand to avoid overstock. Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (responsive to the current low-demand regime and recent variability) so the OR backend targets lower base-stock and reduces holding cost risk.

On-hand=235, in-transit=79 \u2192 healthy pipeline but demand history (early 2019 weekly samples mean=86.8) suggests using full-sample baseline. Choose L by calculation to reflect observed lead time=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend sets base-stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples, balancing service (profit=holding cost) with current ample inventory.

No new sustained demand regime change detected since prior carry-over insight. To align with observed lead time evidence I let L be calculated from observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overfitting to short recent fluctuations and let the OR engine compute base_stock and capped order consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=242, in-transit=70. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has settled much lower than the early-year spike: last 5 weekly demands = [12,30,25,34,38], recent avg \u224827.8/week. To avoid excess holding while keeping service, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 weeks so the OR base-stock reflects current lower demand and reduces overstock risk. Sigma will also use the same 5-week window to capture current volatility.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. I set L using recent observed lead times (calculate average) to confirm actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest stable regime (keeps safety stock aligned with recent lower demand), balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost so critical to avoid overstock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent weeks show steady moderate demand (last observed weekly demands ~25-38) and inventory is healthy: on-hand=187, in-transit=70. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I use default lead time to keep model aligned with supplier promise. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (captures the earlier confirmed upward regime while smoothing over noise). This will produce a base-stock target that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost while the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) already covers several weeks of demand, reducing need for aggressive replenishment.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16. Recent demand has settled at a low summer level (last 5 demands: 34,38,25,30,34; avg\u224832.2). On-hand=194, in-transit=105 => pipeline covers multiple periods but we should size forecast to recent demand to avoid excess holding. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. I set L to calculate (backend will confirm average observed lead time\u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce excess safety stock from past high-demand regime while preserving service given observed lead time and current pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been stable and low (~20\u201340 units/week) since spring; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Current on-hand=193 + in-transit=76 \u2192 pipeline covers many weeks of demand (sufficient buffer). I select L=default to use the promised/typical lead time (4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to base the replenishment target on the most recent ~20 weeks (captures current low-demand regime and de-emphasizes the early high-Jan spike), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to estimate recent demand variability. Using recent_N for both demand mean and volatility tightens the base-stock around current demand, reducing overstock while preserving service given ample pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows stable actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at W=4) and demand has trended lower vs. the Jan peak but shows no new sustained regime shift in the last 3+ periods. On-hand=155 + in-transit=76 gives 231 units in pipeline which covers several weeks of current demand (~30\u201338/week). I select default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this is conservative given no new sustained changepoint and prevents overreacting to recent noise while balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods previously, so keep promised lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Current on-hand=166, in-transit=89. Recent demand (Periods 31-35) = [34,30,38,36,29], recent mean \u224833.4; prior carry-over indicates a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 and confirmed lead time=4. No evidence of new lead-time delays or lost shipments in the last several concluded periods. To keep the OR backend responsive to the recent lower, stable weekly demand, use promised lead time and recent demand statistics: L = default (promised 4), mu_hat = recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime mean over the review+lead horizon, sigma_hat = recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent observed variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=140, in-transit=153; recent realized weekly demand has dropped vs earlier in-year. Recent 6 demands (Periods 32-37) = [30,38,36,29,13,13], recent mean \u224826.5/week. Lead time history consistently shows 4 periods; use promised/default L=4. To reflect the lower recent demand regime and reduce holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the recent 6-week regime). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled recent mean for base stock while sigma from the same window captures current volatility; with profit=holding, target z\u22480 so base_stock\u2248mu_hat, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has moderated compared with the early 2019 surge; last 8 observed weekly demands (Periods 31-38) = [34,30,38,36,29,13,13,16], recent mean \u224826.6 and recent variability reduced vs earlier months. On-hand=213, in-transit=64 (pipeline healthy). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (last 8 weeks) so the OR backend targets a base-stock that balances current lower demand against holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Current on-hand=198, in-transit=64. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time=4. Recent demand (last several months) is lower and stable (~15\u201336/week) versus the early 2019 spike; to reflect current regime I use recent history for demand mean and volatility. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (4) as confirmed by past concludes. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 this reduces overstocking from the early high-demand regime while maintaining service given current low demand and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Recent demand has fallen sharply vs midsummer: last 6 weeks (Periods 35-40) avg demand \u224816.2/wk vs prior 6-week avg \u224832.2/wk. On-hand=187, in-transit=64 (healthy cover). Promised lead time=4 has been consistently observed historically. To adapt quickly to the recent lower-demand regime while preserving service, I use recent_N demand estimates (N=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new lower mean/volatility; keep L as default (promised=4). This reduces forecasted replenishment and holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting ~Period 35: avg demand dropped from 32.17 (Periods 29-34) to 16.17 (Periods 35-40), \u2248\u221250%, sustained 6 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $-243.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history (Periods 35-41) shows a sustained ~50% demand drop (avg ~16/week) vs earlier (~32/week); on-hand=247, in-transit=0 so current stock is ample versus the lower demand. Lead times have repeatedly concluded as 4 periods. I therefore use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample statistics (which reflect the sustained lower-demand regime) to set base_stock; this avoids over-ordering while the high on-hand cushion reduces immediate stockout risk.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained demand drop starting ~Period 35 (avg \u224816/week); on-hand=238, in-transit=32, so current coverage is high vs reduced demand. Lead times historically confirmed at 4 periods. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 35-42) to reflect the new low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean, and sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture recent lower volatility. This reduces target base-stock and limits new receipts, trading lower holding cost against service level appropriate for the sustained lower demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent weekly demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 35 (requests ~29\u219213\u219213\u219216\u219215\u219211\u21924\u21929\u21929), so I use recent data to reflect the lower demand and low variability. On-hand =229 and in-transit=32 \u2014 ample cover versus current low demand. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals match promised), so keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent low-demand regime (regime length ~9 weeks from Period 35\u201343). These parameters reduce orders relative to historical higher-demand periods, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=221, in-transit=32. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time; no evidence to override promised lead time. Demand regime change detected around Period 35 (sustained lower demand). I therefore use L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (regime length from P35\u2013P44 \u224810 weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples to reflect the lower recent demand and avoid overstock. sigma_hat set to recent_N N=10 to capture recent lower volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders to lower holding costs while preserving service for the confirmed low-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since ~Period 35 (weekly demands mostly ~4\u201329, recent avg ~12.55). On-hand=210, in-transit=32 (ample cover). Lead time observations in concluded messages are consistently 4 periods; use calculated L. Set demand forecast using recent_N over the post-change regime to reflect the lower mean (N=11 covers Periods 35\u201345). Use same recent_N window for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices reduce excess ordering given high on-hand while keeping service via OR backend's base-stock formula tuned to the new lower-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since ~Period 35 (Periods 35-46 avg \u224816\u2192recent weekly avg last 6 periods \u22487.3 units). On-hand=239, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to current low demand; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time = 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm LT=4.
