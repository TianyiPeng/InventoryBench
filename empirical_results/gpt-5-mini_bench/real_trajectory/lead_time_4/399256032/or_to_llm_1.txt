Lead-time evidence: no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments; must assume promised L=4 for now.

The Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for the order placed in Period 1 \u2014 this is expected because orders placed in Period 1 would arrive during Period 5 and be visible in a conclude message at Period 6. No concluded arrivals yet, so do not assume loss or shorter lead time. Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=148 (likely the Period 1 order). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 86.8 units/week, so OR's (1+L)-period demand estimate \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 434 over the 5-period review+lead window. OR uses q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0, so base_stock \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 = 434. Pipeline (148) + on-hand (0) covers far less than base_stock. OR's capped policy limits the order to 149 (it smooths extreme orders). Risk trade-offs: Large order to fully replenish to base_stock (\u2248286 more units) would better cover expected demand but increases holding cost ($1/unit/period) and may be unnecessary if in-transit is confirmed or if lead time/arrival patterns change. With only one period of missing arrivals (no concluded evidence of loss) and given OR's cap to prevent over-ordering, I will follow OR's capped recommendation to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining reasonable service. Final strategy: place order = 149 units (follow OR recommendation).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (matches carry-over Period6). Inventory: on-hand=74, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory=0. OR recommended 113 units based on historical 5-period mean (\u03bc\u0304=86.8 \u2192 \u03bc\u0302=434) and caps; OR uses promised L and old demand. Demand analysis: recent periods show a sustained, much lower regime \u2014 Periods 41\u201345 demands = [4,9,9,8,11], avg = 8.2 units/week (5 periods), which is ~74% below the earlier low-regime avg P29\u2013P33 = 31.4 and ~91% below the original historical mean 86.8. With profit = holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) so optimal base-stock would equal forecasted multi-period demand; given strong evidence of a sustained decline and large holding cost equal to profit, carrying excess stock is costly. Current on-hand (74) already covers many weeks at current demand (~9 weeks at ~8 units/week). Risk of stockout is low short-term; lead time is long (4), but incoming pipeline=0 and recent demand is low and stable. Action: do not order this period (order=0) to avoid unnecessary holding costs and let inventory be drawn down while monitoring next concluded arrivals/demand for confirmation. Follow-up: if next concluded periods show demand rebound or arrivals indicating lost shipments, revise orders accordingly.",
