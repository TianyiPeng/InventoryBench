Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time; use promised lead time and historical weekly samples (5 weeks ending 2019-02-04). Choose default L to use promised 4-period lead time. Choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a baseline replenishment given zero inventory and balancing profit vs. holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (92,68,85,95,64) give mean \u224880.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=104 (ordered Period 1) but no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time and historical demand: set L to default (promised 4), mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean from all samples, and sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps policy aligned with historical demand while waiting for arrival confirmations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan-Feb 2019) show mean demand ~80s. On-hand=0, in-transit=216 (orders from P1 and P2). No concluded arrivals yet (both prior orders show arrived=0), but only two missed conclusions\u2014insufficient evidence to infer a persistent lead-time shift or lost shipments. Use default promised lead time so backend uses promised L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost given limited evidence of a regime change.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=367. Historical weekly demand samples (5): 92,68,85,95,64 (mean=80.8). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; promised lead time (4) retained. Use default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service level (use all historical data) while avoiding premature increases to safety stock given lack of evidence for demand or lead-time shifts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean \u224880.8 units/week; no concluded arrivals yet so no observed lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=535 (pipeline large). Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrival messages confirm an actual lead time shift. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use all samples) to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level with holding cost given current high pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded arrival shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead time = 4), matching the promised lead time. On-hand=0 and in-transit=629 (pipeline large); no sustained lost-shipment pattern yet. Use promised/default lead time and demand aggregation across all samples: with L=4 the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(history) for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(history) for sigma_hat, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreaction to a single late-but-confirmed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals (P5: P1\u2192arrived, P6: P2\u2192arrived) confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Historical weekly demand samples (92,68,85,95,64) mean=80.8. With L=4, review+lead horizon =5 weeks, default mu_hat = 5\xd7mean = 404 units. Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 634 \u2014 pipeline (634) comfortably exceeds the 5-period demand forecast (404), so no aggressive upward adjustment needed. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=641. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192P6, Period3\u2192P7). Demand history samples (92,68,85,95,64) give mean\u224880.8 units/week; with confirmed L=4 I use methods that reflect the full review+lead period without overreacting to recent stockouts. L: use calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed =4). mu_hat: default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples =5\xd780.8. sigma_hat: default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices signal the OR engine to target a base stock that covers the 5-period demand distribution given confirmed lead time while keeping holding cost in mind; large in-transit (641) will be offset by pipeline inventory in the backend ordering calculation.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 concluded demands = 207,105,190,210,220; mean=186.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=676 (covers ~3.6 periods at recent mean\u2014short of (L+1) periods). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded history, so use the calculated lead-time for reporting. To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demands) so the OR backend will size base-stock and cap to reflect the elevated mean and volatility rather than the older small-sample historical weeks. This balances higher service level needs against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1 per unit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized weekly demand has shifted up (recent demands: P5..P9 = 105,190,210,220,188) vs earlier low-season samples. On-hand 10 + in-transit 742 = 752 units; with promised lead time ~4 and review+lead horizon =5 weeks, pipeline likely under-covering recent demand (5-week demand recent mean \u2248182.6 \u2192 target \u2248913). Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (all observed =4). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the new high-demand regime (N=5 captures the most recent sustained increase). This increases replenishment targets to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N reflects volatility from the same window.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=883 which comfortably covers expected (1+L)-period demand. I choose to let the backend compute lead time from observations (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L). These choices reflect confirmed LT=4, use full-sample demand estimates to smooth noise, and avoid overreacting to recent high-demand weeks while keeping service given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=776. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed). Recent realized weekly demand has been well above long-run sample mean (recent demands: 210,220,188,208,337) suggesting a short-term spike, but not yet recorded as a sustained regime change by carry-over rules. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in historical samples while the in-transit volume (776) provides substantial coverage versus expected demand under the default forecast.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time and large in-transit (850) with on-hand 6. Historical weekly sample mean = 80.8 (from provided five samples). Given confirmed lead time=4 and no sustained demand regime change in recent concludes, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters aligned with observed lead time, leverages all historical samples for stable forecasts, and lets the OR engine manage service level vs. holding cost given the large pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand clearly shifted up vs. the provided Jan samples: last 5 concluded demands = [188,208,337,197,67], recent mean=199.4 vs. historical mean=80.8. Current on-hand=203 and in-transit=789 gives ample pipeline but recent volatility is high. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history. For demand forecast and uncertainty use recent_N=5 to reflect the new higher-demand regime (captures recent mean/variance). These params will raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit mitigates immediate stockout risk and holding cost is low ($1 vs profit $19), so favor service level.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Historical weekly samples (92,68,85,95,64) give mean=80.8. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in prior concludes). Current on-hand=400 and in-transit=888 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=1,288 units, which comfortably exceeds a (1+L)=5 period demand forecast (5\xd780.8=404). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample stats and caps orders appropriately.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=289, in-transit=837 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods versus recent demand. I therefore select default lead time (use promised lead time = 4) and default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps parameters grounded in long-run historical demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive holding cost given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple confirmations in carry-over). On-hand=357, in-transit=560 => pipeline covers many periods so no aggressive upward forecast adjustment. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand moments so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this balances service level and holding cost given large existing inventory and confirmed LT.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=688. Historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 4 periods (Periods 6 and 13); recent zero-arrival concludes do not yet constitute a sustained lead-time shift (need 3+ periods). Demand has been variable but no clear recent regime change in the demand series. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples, keeping ordering consistent with historical cadence and avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Historical sample mean (provided) ~80.8/wk; with promised L=4 the (1+L) demand = ~404 \u2014 current in-transit substantially exceeds that, so use default lead time and default demand estimates.

Use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with observed confirmations. Demand history (provided Jan-Feb samples) yields a weekly mean \u224880.8; with review+lead (1+L)=5, default aggregation (all samples) is appropriate given no confirmed demand regime change.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=270, in-transit=741 \u2192 total pipeline=1,011 units, well above (1+L)*mean demand. Historical sample mean (given) = 80.8 units/week; product is summer apparel but no sustained recent regime shift. Past concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and historical demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This avoids overreacting to short-term swings while the pipeline already covers multiple periods of demand and holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Observed pipeline: on-hand=548, in-transit=465. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods \u2014 use calculated lead time to match observed. Demand has shifted up materially versus the 5 initial samples; recent 10-period mean (~156.7) >> early sample mean (~80.8). To capture the current regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current demand and volatility while L is inferred from observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: early sample mean=80.8 (Periods in Jan/Feb) \u2192 recent 10-period mean=156.7 (+94%), sustained over last 10 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history (Periods 20-29) shows a sustained higher-demand regime: recent 10-period mean \u2248156.7 vs earlier mean \u224880.8 (confirmed in Period 29). Lead time has consistently been 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=737, in-transit=333 provides large pipeline coverage; to align OR base-stock with the confirmed higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the 10-period elevated mean, and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher sustained demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock using the high service quantile implied by profit/holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift (Period 29 onward) with a ~95% increase; on-hand=748, in-transit=252 (ample coverage). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. To keep the OR engine responsive to the new higher-demand regime I set demand estimates using the most recent 10 periods (captures the post-change mean/variance). This balances service (using recent higher mean) against holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 29 (recent 10-period mean \u2248156.7 vs earlier ~80.8). On-hand=740 and in-transit=186 provide substantial coverage today. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. I therefore use the promised/default lead time so OR backend keeps L=4. For demand forecast I use the recent 10-period mean to capture the new higher-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N N=10). Volatility also appears driven by the same recent regime, so use recent 10-period std for sigma_hat (recent_N N=10). These choices align the base-stock calculation to current higher demand while reflecting recent variability, avoiding understocking from using older low-demand samples.

On-hand=711, in-transit=145 \u2014 ample on-hand now but future demand is higher; promised lead time is 4 and historically confirmed. To reflect the sustained regime I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend builds a base-stock sized for the higher recent mean over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Using default lead time (promised) keeps OR engine aligned with contract while relying on recent demand samples to raise targets and avoid future stockouts; recent_N volatility will scale safety stock appropriately.

On-hand=752, in-transit=5 \u2192 ample coverage vs 4-period lead time. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 in concluded messages.

To let the OR backend use its baseline statistical estimates (which incorporate all historical samples and the promised L=4) I select defaults for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so base-stock is computed using full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time. This balances service (capture the higher recent mean via full-sample update) vs. holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=658, in-transit=270. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a higher recent regime (recent 10-period mean ~156.7 per prior insight). Given confirmed LT=4 and the recent elevated demand regime, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher mean over the last 10 periods. Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. This increases base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while keeping volatility tuned to recent observations, balancing service level vs holding cost given high on-hand + in-transit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime flagged in Period 29 (recent 10-period mean elevated). Current inventory: on-hand=599, in-transit=270 (total pipeline=869), which comfortably covers several weeks given elevated demand but some arrivals remain scheduled. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded messages consistently confirm 4-period lead times historically. To capture the confirmed recent demand regime shift, I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 10 samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent regime) while keeping sigma aligned to recent variability so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-28: recent demand has been in the higher regime identified at Period 29 (sustained ~10-period increase). On-hand=537, in-transit=270 \u2192 pipeline strong vs. elevated demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4; keep promised lead time. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align forecast and risk buffer with the confirmed higher-demand regime (reduces stockouts vs. using full-sample mean). This balances service (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1) by targeting demand over the review+lead window using the last 10 periods of data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (carry-over previously noted: recent 10-period mean \u2248156.7 vs earlier ~80.8). On-hand=484, in-transit=270 \u2192 healthy pipeline but demand remains elevated; use recent demand stats to capture the new regime. L: keep default (promised lead time = 4) consistent with observed confirms. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=10 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the confirmed higher-demand regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture elevated mean) while sigma from recent data limits excess safety stock given sizable on-hand + in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-234.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=728, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time=4. A sustained demand regime shift was detected around Period 29 (recent 10-period mean \u2248156.7 vs earlier mean \u224880.8). To capture the new higher demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time, I use the promised/default lead time and set demand estimates using the recent 10-period window for mean and volatility so the OR backend will target a larger base-stock appropriate to the higher, sustained demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=678, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows consistent observed lead time=4 (matches promised); no evidence of new lead-time delays or sustained demand regime changes since prior insight. Use default lead time (promised) to keep backend aligned with supplier terms. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) because historical seed samples and no strong, sustained recent changepoint justify the global-sample baseline. This balances service (using established demand mean) against the low holding cost ($1) and current high on-hand stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 29 (recent 10-period mean ~156.7 vs earlier ~80.8). On-hand=638, in-transit=260 (order placed in P41 arrives later). Use promised lead time (default=4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 10 periods to capture the elevated regime; likewise use recent 10 for volatility to reflect current variability. These settings raise base-stock to service higher demand while keeping sigma aligned to observed variability, balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been low (Oct-Nov average ~55) after a sustained higher regime around Periods ~17-33; on-hand=513 + in-transit=260 gives ample coverage vs near-term demand. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4. No sustained new changepoint detected. I choose default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base_stock and cap; this avoids over-reacting to recent short-term dips and leverages the confirmed lead time while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (recent 10-period mean ~156.7) and confirmed lead time = 4 in prior concludes. Current inventory (on-hand 482 + in-transit 415 = 897) covers multiple weeks but pipeline may include overdue/lost earlier orders; continue using promised L to align with concluded evidence. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=10) to capture the established higher-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the OR engine on the higher recent mean while letting the cap prevent excessive single-period orders, balancing service level (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=444, in-transit=415. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes confirm 4-period arrivals; no evidence of new lead-time shifts. Recent demand (last 10 periods) is lower than the earlier high regime, so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current lower demand level and recent volatility. This balances service level against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and strong unit profit (q\u22480.95).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=662, in-transit=155. Historical conclues consistently confirm lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift (Period 29 onward) with recent 10-period mean \u2248156.7 (+94% vs early mean). To reflect the sustained higher demand I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history matches promised LT and no new LT anomalies observed. This balances higher service level to capture the new demand regime while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock beyond the recent-volatility estimate.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand regime is higher (carry-over: recent 10-period mean \u2248156.7 vs earlier ~80s) and actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4. On-hand=624 + in-transit=155 gives ample coverage now, but regime implies higher ongoing demand so use recent-window estimates. Set L to default (promised lead time=4, confirmed by history). Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This balances service (higher base-stock to meet elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than long-run low-demand mean.
