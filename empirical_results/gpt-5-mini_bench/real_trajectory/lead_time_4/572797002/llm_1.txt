Product is a lightweight womens tank top \u2014 seasonally weaker in winter; occasional promotional spikes (e.g., Black Friday) can cause short surges but not sustained demand. Demand analysis: recent demands P40\u2013P43 = 50, 40, 125, 31. P42 spike (125) appears isolated; surrounding weeks are low (40\u201350). Use conservative weekly demand forecast ~40 units. Lead time & pipeline: lead time confirmed = 4 periods (history shows consistent P\u2192P+4 arrivals). On-hand = 31, in-transit = 240 (these will arrive across future periods per confirmed LT). Coverage requirement: need coverage for L+1 = 5 periods of demand \u2192 5*40 = 200 units. Current pipeline (31+240 = 271) already exceeds that. Ordering risk: excess units incur $1 holding cost/period; marginal profit is $19, so avoid unnecessary inventory. Final order logic: place no order this period to avoid added holding cost while pipeline already covers projected demand including safety for isolated spikes.",

Lead time: confirmed 4 periods from history. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=31, in-transit=180 => total available = 211. Planning horizon: must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand after decision. Forecast: conservative weekly demand \u224840 units (based on P43\u2013P45 average \u224837), 5-period requirement \u2248200 units.
