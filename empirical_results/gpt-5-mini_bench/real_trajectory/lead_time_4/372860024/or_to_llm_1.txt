With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after our decision. Target demand coverage = 5 \xd7 85.8 \u2248 429 units. Service-level policy (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile \u22480.95, z*\u22481.645) calls for substantial safety stock beyond the 5-period mean. OR recommended 97 units (uses older historical mean and promised L) which would leave pipeline far short. Calculation: desired stock \u2248 429 (5-period mean) + safety buffer \u2248 0\u201350 (uncertain \u03c3) \u2192 ~429\u2013480; minus current pipeline 146 \u21d2 order \u2248 283\u2013334. I choose the midpoint conservative-aggressive order of 330 units to restore availability given high profit per sale and low holding cost. This size both rebuilds pipeline to meet expected demand over lead time and provides safety stock for variability. Risk: if demand reverts to historical low, this increases holding cost, but profit/higher critical fractile justifies prioritizing service. Final action orders 330 units for SKU 372860024.",
