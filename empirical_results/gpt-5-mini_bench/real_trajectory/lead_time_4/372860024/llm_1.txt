  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas); demand recently volatile but underlying mid-year regime around ~60/week. Recent sold when stocked: P43=28, P44=33, P45=81, P46=47 (stock-limited). Carry-over confirms lead_time=4. Pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=153 (22 arriving in P49, 131 in P50). Orders placed now arrive in Period 51, so to meet the rule (order+on-hand+in-transit should cover L+1=5 periods of demand) we forecast demand \u224860 units/period => 5*60=300 units required. Subtract current coverage (0+153)=153 => order \u2248147 units. This balances service vs holding cost given demand uncertainty and recent volatility.",
