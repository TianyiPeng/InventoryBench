Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand ~37 across weeks. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time is unknown; no evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time to let OR backend apply its lead-time inference. Choose default demand/volatility methods so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (using historical mean over the full sample) against holding cost without overfitting to short windows given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 demand=43; historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean ~37. Demand appears stable; only one concluded period in game (order placed in P1 did not arrive by P1 conclude). On-hand=0, in-transit=48 (ordered P1) \u2014 shipment is overdue relative to visibility but not enough concluded evidence to change promised lead time. To avoid overreacting, use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock using full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level given limited evidence of regime change while avoiding extra safety stock for an unconfirmed lead-time change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean=37 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=159 (some pipeline but no concluded arrivals yet). No concluded arrival messages show actual lead time change, so do not infer a new lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to potentially lost/delayed shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical demand samples (2019-01) show mean ~37 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=224 (orders placed prior to Period 5); no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer lead-time change or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 4; use default lead time. Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, which balances service level (covers L+1 periods of demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent conclude shows the Period1 order arrived in Period5 with observed lead_time=4, matching promised L=4. Historical weekly demand samples mean=37 units; with (1+L)=5 review+lead periods default forecast = 5\xd737=185 units. Current inventory (on-hand 5 + in-transit 214 = 219) comfortably exceeds the default forecast, so keep default lead time and default demand/volatility settings to avoid unnecessary extra ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5 conclude, observed lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1026.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=205 (covers several past orders); confirmed actual lead time=4 in prior period. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-6) has risen vs. older historical samples: recent mean \u224854.33/week. To cover review+lead (1+L=5) periods and respond to the higher recent demand, use recent_N=6 for mu_hat so the OR backend scales forecast to current regime. Use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. Keep L as default (promised lead time=4) since arrivals have confirmed that lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=219 which appears sufficient to cover multiple future periods. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (Period1\u2192arrived Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, Period3\u2192Period7). Given confirmed LT=4 and stable historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb weekly mean=37), use calculated lead time to match observed behavior and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR backend sets a high service level appropriate for profit=$19 vs holding=$1 (q\u22480.95). sigma uses default to reflect historical variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 5 (recent demands: P5=43, P6=73, P7=98, P8=72). On-hand=0, in-transit=238 (covers multiple periods). Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (mean of P5-P8 = 71.5, (1+L)=5 -> mu_hat anchored to recent average). For sigma I use recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These parameters increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has jumped sharply vs. Jan baseline: Periods 5-9 demands = [43,73,98,72,69], mean=71 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=309. Promised L=4 and concluded history consistently shows lead_time=4. With L=4, review+lead horizon =5 periods \u2192 required stock \u22485\xd771=355 units; in-transit 309 is insufficient, so forecast must reflect the higher recent regime. I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed=4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new higher mean over the last 5 demand observations, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping volatility estimate grounded in recent data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg demand increased from 37 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) to 71 (Periods 5..9: 2019-03-11..2019-04-08), +92%; sustained for 5 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted up: periods 5\u201310 demands = [43,73,98,72,69,78], mean \u224872.2, markedly above the historical pre-shift mean \u224837. On-hand=0, in-transit=373 (large pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. I therefore: keep L as default (promised=4) to match confirmed lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to base the (1+L) forecast on the observed higher regime mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture volatility in the new regime. This biases orders to cover the sustained higher demand while sigma from recent data keeps safety stock responsive; the large in-transit quantity will be accounted for by the OR engine when computing final order.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=350. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime increase starting Period 6 (recent weekly demand average ~78 over Periods 5\u201311). Use lead time = promised (confirmed) and base mu/sigma on the recent high-demand regime. L: use default to keep promised/confirmed L=4. mu_hat: recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201311) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects higher demand and avoids understocking. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility during the new regime. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma uses recent variability to control safety stock against stockouts given in-transit pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=382. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes and recent demand shows a sustained higher regime (Periods 5\u201312 average \u224871 vs historical 37). Use promised/confirmed lead time to align with OR engine assumptions, and set demand estimates from the recent high-demand regime (use last 8 periods) so orders cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon while avoiding overstock given large pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 6 (recent mean ~85/week over last 5 periods). Current on-hand=48, in-transit=383 (ample pipeline). To reflect the confirmed LT and the new higher-demand regime while keeping variability focused on recent behavior, set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (higher base stock for higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Demand has shifted up (Period 6 onward avg \u224871 vs prior 37); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the new regime (last 5 concluded demand samples). This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while pipeline size limits excessive ordering, balancing high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=55, in-transit=383. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 6 (avg rose ~+92%) and persists through recent periods. To reflect the new higher demand while trusting the promised lead time, set L=default (use promised 4). For demand level and volatility use recent data covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201315, 10 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the higher mean and current variability. This raises the base-stock to protect service level under higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N controls safety-stock sizing to limit excess holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history confirms a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 6 (avg ~71 over Periods 5\u20139, +92% vs earlier sample). On-hand=69, in-transit=303 (total pipeline=372) which should cover multiple upcoming periods with L=4. Set L to default (promised=4) since concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new regime (regime length=5); sigma also use recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher recent mean while keeping safety stock responsive to observed variance, balancing service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost $1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (avg ~71) and actual lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand=103, in-transit=304 \u2014 pipeline+on-hand comfortably covers multiple weeks but we must still forecast using the elevated regime. Set L to promised (default=4). Use recent_N for demand (mu_hat) and variability (sigma_hat) to reflect the new regime; choose N=13 to cover the recent sustained regime (Periods 5..17) so the OR backend's base-stock reflects higher mean and observed volatility. This balances higher service-level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1) by biasing toward the elevated-demand recent sample set while relying on promised lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime since Period 6 (confirmed earlier). Current on-hand=117, in-transit=290 (sizable pipeline). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 consistently. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (matches promised=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 13-18 demands: 61,74,76,102,76,66 \u2192 recent mean \u224875.8) to capture the elevated regime and avoid dilution by older low-season samples. Sigma set recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the large pipeline plus on-hand will temper immediate orders, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Observed lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (arrivals consistently show W=4). On-hand=108 + in-transit=238 = 346 units, which covers several periods of elevated demand but we still use a base-stock safety buffer. Demand regime increased starting Period 6 and has been sustained; to capture the new mean/volatility I use recent samples since the changepoint. Methods: L kept as default (promised lead time=4); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=14 (regime from Period 6 through Period 19, length=14) so the OR backend builds base-stock and caps from the elevated-demand regime. No evidence of lost shipments currently.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 6 and consistent concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 (confirmed in history). Current inventory: on-hand=75, in-transit=311 => pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple (1+L)=5 periods of demand at recent levels. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep model aligned with observed arrivals. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) because the historical sample set seeds the prior and confirmed regime shift is already recorded; retain default sigma (all-sample std scaled) to let the OR engine compute safety stock using profit vs holding cost tradeoff. This balances service level (avoid lost sales given confirmed L=4 and elevated demand) against holding cost given large visible pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=108, in-transit=231 (total pipeline 339) \u2014 sufficient coverage but demand remains higher than historical Jan samples. Set L to default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand, use recent_N with N=16 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 6..21 ~ 16 periods of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts over the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent, regime-consistent mean and volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in the higher regime confirmed earlier (Periods 5..9 shift to avg ~71; subsequent periods show sustained higher weekly demand ~76). On-hand=48, in-transit=298 provide ample pipeline but lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods historically. I set L to default (promised lead time 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the last 11 observed demands, avg ~76 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*76). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders to meet the sustained higher demand while relying on confirmed lead time and current pipeline to avoid stockouts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand regime is elevated vs early-sample mean (confirmed Period 10: sustained +92% from Period6 onward). On-hand=88, in-transit=265 (total pipeline=353) \u2014 ample coverage for upcoming lead (L+1) periods but we must keep base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean to avoid stockouts when pipeline depletes. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N (N=9) to focus the forecast on the elevated regime (captures the post-changepoint behaviour), which raises mu_hat and sigma_hat relative to the long-run mean and thus increases service-level target while the capped order limits control excessive ordering and holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=56, in-transit=309 (ample pipeline). Actual lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; stick with promised/default L to match observed confirmations. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 6 (sustained); use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the elevated recent mean while smoothing short noise. Keep sigma_hat as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and sustained higher demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Demand regime has been higher since Period 6 (avg jumped ~+92% and sustained); lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand=112, in-transit=311 (healthy pipeline). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for forecast and volatility to emphasize recent data; keep L at default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm it. This balances service (capture higher mean) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the long-run low-demand mean.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (identified at Period 6) with avg weekly demand ~71. On-hand=99, in-transit=285 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=384 units, which covers (L+1)=5 periods \xd7 ~71 = 355 units, so inventory is adequate but not excessive. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect observed reality. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (capped at 20 samples) so mu_hat reflects the higher sustained mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture current volatility in the same recent window. These choices align the OR backend base-stock to the new demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history (Periods 5\u201328) shows a sustained higher-demand regime (~71 avg) confirmed in carry-over; observed lead times are consistently 4. On-hand=122 + in-transit=263 provides substantial coverage vs. typical weekly demand (~70). Use promised lead time (default) since arrivals consistently match 4 periods. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while limiting noise from early low-demand samples. This biases orders to service the higher regime and balances service level vs. holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime increase (avg \u224871 from Periods 5..9 onward). On-hand 128 + in-transit 239 = 367 units; with L=4 the review+lead horizon = 5 periods. Using recent demand (reflecting the higher regime) keeps forecast aligned with elevated demand and avoids stockouts while limiting holding cost. Chosen methods: L=default to respect confirmed promised lead time (4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to use a robust recent-window mean covering the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This configuration lets the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using recent regime stats so orders + pipeline cover ~5 periods of elevated demand while capping order sizes to control holding cost.

Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning at Period 6; recent demand has been stable in the higher regime. I set L to default (use promised 4) since concluded history confirms lead_time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (use latest 20 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias the base-stock toward the sustained higher demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand data; with profit >> holding cost this supports higher service levels while still using recent variance to cap orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in prior conclude messages). Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning at Period 6 (higher mean since then). On-hand = 144 and in-transit = 227 provide good coverage, but to align the OR engine with the post-shift demand level I use recent demand statistics. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (4) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from the most recent 20 samples, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand periods. This balances service level (use recent higher mean) against holding cost by limiting the window to recent data.

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6; inventory + pipeline currently ample vs typical demand so no aggressive uplifts required. I select L=default (use promised lead time=4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history; this balances service (given proven lead time=4) against holding cost given current high on-hand + in-transit levels and the earlier documented demand shift. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed because arrivals have been reliable.

On-hand=106 + in-transit=210 gives 316 units in pipeline/on-hand, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand under our forecast. Set L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent sustained demand regime while capping N to 20 per guidance; this balances service level (capture increased mean) against holding cost by avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent weekly demand has been elevated vs the original sample (recent 5-periods: 62,53,90,69,53 \u2192 mean ~65). On-hand=106 + in-transit=240 = 346 units, which covers ~5.3 weeks at recent avg demand (~65) and therefore roughly (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Lead time has been historically confirmed at 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. To keep responsiveness to the recent higher regime while limiting holding cost, forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks (captures latest regime and volatility). Thus: L=default; mu_hat from recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean to recent demand; sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. No evidence of a new sustained changepoint beyond previously recorded insights.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 6 (carry-over noted). On-hand=91 + in-transit=241 = 332 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at current demand. Lead time has repeatedly been 4 in concluded messages, so use observed-lead-time averaging to lock to actual performance. To reflect the established post-changepoint demand regime and reduce sensitivity to older low-demand samples, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window (N=20) to capture the most recent 20 demand observations (balances responsiveness vs noise). These parameters will bias the OR base-stock toward meeting the higher, sustained demand while the sigma estimate from recent data controls safety-stock to limit excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=87, in-transit=238 \u2192 pipeline=325 units, which covers multiple weeks of demand under the confirmed 4-period lead time. Historical data show a sustained demand regime shift upward (noted earlier) and recent weeks' demand centers around ~50\u201390 units. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed historically as 4). I choose recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent post-changepoint demand regime and recent volatility while smoothing week-to-week noise; this balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=110, in-transit=209. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning around Period 6; recent demand is higher and more variable than the original sample window. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I choose recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (use the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Same recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher sustained demand while using observed lead-time evidence so the OR backend balances service level and holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=171, in-transit=175. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has softened vs the earlier high regime (post-Period 6); to adapt to the recent downward drift while respecting the sustained regime shift evidence, I keep L as the promised/default (confirmed=4) and use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent 8 demand samples. This balances service (reflecting the earlier higher baseline) with responsiveness to the recent drop, and avoids overcommitting given large on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Recent demand has fallen (last 5 demands: 52,50,51,22,23) versus earlier higher regime; to react to the recent lower/volatile November demand I use a short recent window so forecasts reflect current demand level and variability. Set L to default (promised lead time=4) since concludes confirm 4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest downward shift and recent volatility, reducing excess inventory while preserving service.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 and lead time has been consistently observed as 4. Current on-hand 204 + in-transit 94 = 298 units (healthy pipeline). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=4 (confirmed by history). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to center forecasts and volatility on the sustained, higher-demand regime (reduces stockouts while avoiding excessive extra safety stock). This balances high profit per unit against low holding cost by letting the OR backend compute base_stock from recent demand moments while respecting the promised lead time and capped order size.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent on-hand=204, in-transit=98 (total pipeline=302). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly), and no new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint since prior insights. Inventory + pipeline comfortably covers several weeks of demand, so use default certified statistics and promised lead time to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap. Methods chosen: L=default to respect promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to use full-sample mean scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps ordering stable and avoids overreacting to short-term dips while the pipeline remains healthy.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent 5-week demand has fallen vs. the spring spike (last 5 demands: 22,23,25,45,28; mean\u224828.6/week). On-hand=225 + in-transit=134 = 359 units \u2014 ample coverage vs. a 5-period (1+L) demand forecast. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods. I choose L=default to trust the promised (and historically observed) 4-period lead time. For demand and volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-winter demand regime and reduce ordering sensitivity to the earlier spring surge; this keeps base-stock conservative and avoids excess holding given low holding cost but already-large on-hand. Recent_N for sigma uses same N to reflect recent variability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-summer/highs to lower values in Nov\u2013Dec (most recent demands: Periods 39\u201344 = 22,23,25,45,28,33). On-hand=192, in-transit=134 (ample pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the recent lower demand regime while keeping the known L=4, I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent six demand observations so the OR backend reduces orders relative to summer peaks and avoids excess holding cost given current high on-hand+in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=111, in-transit=134. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 (recorded earlier). To respect that and the promised lead time, set L=default. Recent demand shows elevated variability and a holiday spike (last 5 demands: 25,45,28,33,81) so I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias the (L+1)-period demand forecast toward current regime while keeping risk sensitivity high; this balances service (avoid stockouts during the spike) against holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 43-46 = 28,33,81,67) shows elevated and volatile December sales; to capture the most recent regime and avoid overreacting to a single spike, I use recent_N with N=5 for mean and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed by backend). This balances service (profit $19 vs hold $1 \u21d2 high target fill) while limiting inventory risk given already-large pipeline. No evidence of new lost shipments requiring explicit L change.
