  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, and repeatedly thereafter). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=232 (orders placed in recent periods P43\u2013P45). Those in-transit units will arrive across upcoming periods (none arrive before end-of-period messages until P47+), so pipeline already provides substantial coverage. Demand analysis: recent weeks show volatile demand with a single extreme spike (Period 45 demand=342) but prior 4\u20138 weeks remain moderate (typically 20\u201380/week); carry-over rules require 3+ periods of consistent change to record a regime shift\u2014this spike is not sustained. OR recommended 133 units using promised lead time and historical series; because we already have 232 units in pipeline (greater than a multi-week demand cover) and holding cost is low but nonzero ($1/unit/period), ordering additional units now would increase expected holding cost without clear evidence of sustained higher demand. Final strategy: do not place a new order this period (order=0) to avoid overstock; monitor arrivals and demand next 2\u20133 periods and only resume ordering if multiple periods confirm elevated demand or if pipeline shortfalls appear.",
