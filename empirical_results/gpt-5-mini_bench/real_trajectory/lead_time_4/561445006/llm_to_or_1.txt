Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time = 4 periods. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable demand around mean 59.2 units/week. No evidence of changepoint or delayed shipments (insufficient history). Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level with holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded Period 1 demand=98 (sold 0 due to stockout); historical weekly samples (61,71,61,52,51) show no sustained regime change (only one high-demand observation). On-hand=0, in-transit=73 (order from P1 has not concluded yet; no evidence actual lead time differs from promised). Use default lead time and demand estimates: no 3+ period sustained shift to justify recent_N or explicit adjustments. Defaults balance service level using full historical mean and variance given limited new evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=168 (orders from P1/P2 still in transit; not yet overdue given promised L=4). Recent demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show stable weekly demand ~59\u201371; no evidence of a sustained regime shift or lead-time change (orders have not reached promised arrival window). To avoid overreacting to in-transit but unconfirmed arrivals, use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (use historical mean) against holding cost given profit/holding=$4/$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-3) is much higher than historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=269 (these are the orders from P1-P3; none have concluded yet). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different actual lead time, so keep L=default to let backend assume promised LT. Demand appears to have shifted upward starting Period 1; to capture this regime I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) (uses demands 98, 92, 130) so the base-stock reflects the new higher demand over the review+lead horizon. Demand volatility has also increased, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed variability and avoid understating safety stock. These choices increase service level to avoid stockouts during the apparent demand surge while the lead-time picture remains unconfirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: historical mean (2019-01 samples) = 59.2 vs recent mean (Periods 1-3) = 106.7 (+80%). Sustained for 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=410 (sum of orders P1-P4) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, consistent with promised lead time (L=4) because arrivals will only be visible after Period 5 conclude. Recent demand has shifted up from historical Jan mean (~59) to a higher regime (recent periods: 98,92,130,84). I set L=default to use promised lead time (no concluded evidence to revise). I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 4 demand samples) so the OR engine increases base stock while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical weekly samples (2019-01) mean=59.2 but recent demand has jumped: Periods1-3 demands = [98,92,130], mean=106.7 (+80%) and Period5 demand=102 consistent with higher regime. One concluded arrival shows actual lead time=4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5). Reconcile: pipeline (470) covers multiple weeks but arrivals are observed with 1-period observation delay; no lost-shipment evidence beyond the single confirmed arrival. Set L by calculate to lock in observed lead time evidence. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the most recent 3 demand samples from Periods1-3). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma estimated from the recent regime so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has been higher than 2019-Jan baseline (carry-over noted: recent mean ~106.7 vs historical ~59.2, sustained 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=476 (multiple prior orders arriving on 4-period cadence). Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (use last 3 periods of demand for (1+L)-period forecast). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) so volatility reflects the recent regime. These choices help the OR backend size base stock to meet elevated demand while reflecting confirmed lead time and recent variability, reducing stockouts given zero on-hand and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand stabilized around ~102\u2013105 units (Periods 5-7) after an upward shift vs. historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (pipeline large relative to recent demand). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (use empirical avg). Use recent 3-period demand to capture the new higher regime (Periods 5-7 mean ~102.7) so mu_hat reflects current demand over review+lead (1+L). Use recent 3-period volatility for sigma to reflect current variability. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples and accounts for observed shipments (reduces risk from potential lost shipments).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Demand has shifted up to ~100+ units/week vs historical ~59; recent 8 weeks show sustained higher demand. On-hand=27, in-transit=363 (large pipeline) but past shipments confirmed actual lead time=4. I set L via calculation to reflect observed lead-time history. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and current volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet service while avoiding excess inventory given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=73, in-transit=357. Observed lead times consistently 4 periods (orders placed P1-P5 arrived after 4). Recent demand has been higher than historical baseline; I use a short recent window to capture the elevated regime and keep lead time at promised (and observed) 4 to match arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_N to adapt to the higher recent mean demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while not overstating lead time given confirmed arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent realized lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods (orders on P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10). Demand has been in a higher regime (~100+ per period) vs historical ~59; recent periods (P5\u2013P10) show sustained elevated demand. On-hand=49 with in-transit=362 covers multiple periods but elevated demand argues for forecasting from recent samples. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime, which helps the OR backend target service while avoiding excess holding cost given current on-hand and pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded lead times = 4 in all observed arrivals => confirm L=4. Recent demand has shifted higher (recent periods 7-11 show elevated mean and a large spike at Period 11), so use recent demand statistics to forecast across review+lead. Choose L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime (last 5 demands: Periods 7-11). This balances service (higher target stock for elevated demand) while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility to avoid over/under ordering given holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent realized demand (Periods 8-12 = 114,87,125,183,117) is well above historical 2019-Jan mean (59.2), signaling a sustained higher-demand regime. Lead times observed in concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. To capture current demand level I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demands (most relevant for forecasting over the (1+L)-period review+lead window). For L I use calculate to reflect the empirically observed lead time=4. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; using observed lead time avoids under-ordering from assuming a shorter lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time=4 (multiple observed arrivals with W=4) and a sustained demand regime shift: recent demand ~106.7 over a 3-period run vs historical mean 59.2. I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed LT=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 (the detected recent high-demand regime of length 3) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this raises targets to meet higher demand while capping orders via the OR cap to limit holding cost exposure given Profit=$4, Holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=0, in-transit=661. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period lead time (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 etc.). Recent demand since Period 5 is elevated versus Jan baseline (sustained high-demand regime, ~10 recent samples). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4 from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to forecast the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent sustained regime (captures the post-changepoint higher mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to measure volatility from the same recent regime. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base-stock sized to the current higher-demand regime while reflecting the empirically confirmed 4-period lead time and recent variability; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and multiple recent periods show substantially higher demand than the Jan baseline (sustained regime). To match the elevated demand I use recent demand to forecast across the (1+L) review+lead window so the OR backend will set a higher base-stock and reduce stockouts while the capped order keeps holding costs controlled. Choices: L=default (promised 4, confirmed by observed arrivals); mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (orders observed arriving 4 periods after order). Recent demand has been elevated and sustained (Periods 12-16: 117,133,141,148,190 \u2014 clear higher regime vs earlier 2019 samples). To keep service while avoiding excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1, I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the higher current mean and recent volatility, and let the backend calculate lead time from observed concludes.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (demands ~100\u2013190) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=38, in-transit=540 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to (1+L) periods of demand. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=13 (covering the recent high-demand regime from Period 5\u201317) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the elevated recent mean and volatility rather than the low January samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given the sizeable in-transit pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-18) is substantially higher than the Jan 2019 baseline (many weeks of ~100\u2013190 vs historical ~60), and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current on-hand=158 + in-transit=457 gives large pipeline (no overdue/lost shipments visible). To reflect the confirmed LT=4 I use calculate (average observed). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (captures the most recent 10 demand observations to adapt mean and volatility upward while smoothing variability). These parameters steer the OR backend to a larger base-stock appropriate for the new demand level while using recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excessive holding given $1/period holding cost vs $4 profit.

======================================================================

Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=169, in-transit=414. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals) and one period with arrived=0 (possible isolated miss) but no sustained loss pattern. Pipeline + on-hand (583 units) comfortably covers several weeks of current demand. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time average (robust to occasional misses). Demand has clearly shifted upward vs the Jan samples; use recent demand to forecast: choose recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime without over-weighting older low-demand weeks. Use the same recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to size base stock for the current higher-demand regime while relying on observed lead time.

For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower summer demand regime vs earlier spike. Sigma is recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the current demand level while using observed lead time to avoid under/over-ordering given pipeline inventory.

Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods; I keep L as promised to match observed behavior.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been substantially higher and sustained vs the Jan baseline (many weeks around 100-190 units); on-hand=297 + in-transit=282 => pipeline_inventory=579. Lead times have consistently concluded at 4 periods. To capture the elevated recent regime I use recent_N demand estimates over the last 20 periods so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and volatility; L set to calculate to lock in the observed lead-time evidence. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock from updated mean and volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=219, in-transit=335 (pipeline=554) \u2014 ample coverage vs. recent elevated demand. Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (use observed average). Demand has shifted up vs. historical Jan samples; to capture the recent higher regime and recent variance I use recent_N over a long recent window to estimate demand mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead period. These parameters bias orders toward service (higher mu_hat) while sigma_hat reflects recent variability so the backend cap still limits extreme orders.

Inventory is healthy (on-hand + in-transit covers many periods) so use promised/confirmed lead time. Demand recently has moderated from earlier spikes; to reflect current regime I use recent data for forecast and volatility (short window).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=236, in-transit=287 (total pipeline=523) which comfortably covers several periods of demand. Historical concluded lead-times consistently show 4 periods (confirmed earlier), so keep promised L. Recent realized demand has fallen from earlier highs; last 5 weekly demands = [78,60,78,47,57], avg=64 \u2014 I treat this as the current regime for forecasting. Therefore set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat based on recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower demand regime, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current demand volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while keeping enough coverage for the 1+L review+lead period given the sizable pipeline.

Historical data shows an earlier demand regime shift (higher mean) confirmed previously, but the most recent 5 periods (Periods 25-29 demands = 60,78,47,57,44) exhibit a sustained lower-demand regime for 5 periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the most recent low-demand regime.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders repeatedly arrived 4 periods after ordering). To avoid excess holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $4) and because current inventory is ample, set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the full sample set, producing conservative replenishment given high on-hand stock.

Date 2019/9/30. On-hand=352, in-transit=133. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2192 set L by observed average to capture true pipeline. Recent demand has dropped materially over the last 5 periods (Periods 29-33); to reflect current regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent low-demand regime). This keeps base-stock responsive to the lower demand while L=calculate ensures pipeline coverage matches observed 4-period lead time and avoids over-ordering given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows the demand regime shift starting Period 29 persisted through Period 33 (5 periods) with avg falling ~49% (67.6 -> 34.2). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand = 317, in-transit = 133; pipeline is healthy so we should size forecast to the new lower-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand, use recent_N based on the confirmed recent low-demand regime (N=5 covers the 5-period regime). Volatility has also reduced with the regime; use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat so the OR backend lowers safety stock accordingly, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given observed lower demand.

Pipeline is large (on-hand 401, in-transit 26) so avoid inflating forecast. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized: last 5 demands (Periods 32-36) = [21,33,35,23,10], avg \u224824.4 units/week (\u2248\u221249% vs earlier regime). On-hand=417, in-transit=0 so current stock covers many weeks; no new arrivals visible. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so keep promised L. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the new low regime for both mean and volatility so the backend reduces base-stock relative to historical highs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=395, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 across many orders -> use observed lead time. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 29 (sustained ~9 periods), so forecast and volatility should be based on recent samples to avoid over-ordering. Using calculate for L (reflect observed lead time), recent_N N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower-demand regime and reduce future holdings given zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=375, in-transit=0. Historical lead times repeatedly observed as 4 periods; recent demand regime shifted down starting Period 29 (Periods 29-33 avg ~34.2) and has persisted through Period 38. To reflect confirmed LT and the sustained lower-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N demand estimates over the current low-demand regime (N=10 periods: Periods 29-38) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock to the current lower demand and avoids excess holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 29 (recent 5 demands: 23,10,22,20,15 \u2192 avg 18). On-hand is high (360) and in-transit 0; no new arrivals pending and promised lead time historically confirmed as 4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower recent regime for (1+L) review+lead demand. For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These params will shrink target base-stock to match the lower demand regime and avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=345, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals confirm actual lead time has been 4 periods repeatedly. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (sustained ~34/wk). To match the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=12 covers Periods 29-40) so the OR backend\u2019s base-stock reflects the lower mean and lower volatility; L set to calculate to reflect observed lead time=4 from concluded arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent demand has been in the lower regime confirmed starting Period 29 (Periods 29-33 avg=34.2 vs earlier 67.6). On-hand=333, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample relative to recent weekly demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 4. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (periods 29\u201341 form a sustained low-demand regime of length 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower demand and volatility; this avoids over-ordering while the OR backend still targets a high service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4; recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 29 (sustained). To avoid overstock while preserving service, keep promised lead time and forecast based on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (N=14, Periods 29\u201342) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current reduced mean and volatility.

Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 35-43 mean \u224818.8 units/week), well below historical seasonal highs; lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods previously. To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised lead time and base forecast on the recent low-demand regime (last 9 periods).

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=255, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 41-44: 12,43,9,26) consistent with the earlier documented regime drop starting Period 29. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. With high on-hand and no evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time shift, use default/promised settings so the OR backend computes base-stock from full history. This avoids overfitting to short recent noise while the large on-hand buffer reduces stockout risk.

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been confirmed historically as 4. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and sustained lower demand, keep L at promised value and set demand forecast and volatility from the recent low-demand regime. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the recent low-demand regime) so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for current lower demand and reduces holding cost risk.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 29 (Periods 29-46 avg \u2248 34; recent last 18 periods show sustained lower demand vs earlier periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed earlier). On-hand=208 and in-transit=151 provide ample coverage; to avoid excess stock vs holding cost, I forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N with N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (N chosen = regime length capped as specified). These parameters reduce target base-stock to reflect the lower recent mean and lower volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost.
