Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time changes. Historical weekly demand samples (110,102,105,123,115) have mean ~111 and no sustained regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, ensuring coverage of the review+lead horizon while avoiding premature deviation from historical statistics.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean \u2248 111; latest observed demand in Period 1 = 130 (one data point, possible short spike but not sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=125 (order from P1 arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this is conservative given limited evidence of a regime change and avoids overreacting to a single high week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~111 units/week. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=257 (matches Period1+Period2 orders of 125+132). No arrivals have been concluded yet (both prior orders still outstanding); this is concerning but not yet a sustained lead-time change (only 2 missing arrivals). I therefore use the promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: L set to default (promised 4), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect stable historical mean, and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to capture historical variability. This balances service level (using historical mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding costs while avoiding premature adjustments based on only two delayed/unconfirmed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean=111 and std\u22487.46. Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals are available to infer a different actual lead time (orders placed so far would not be visible yet given L=4). To avoid premature adjustments I use default lead time and demand estimates: mu_hat default uses (1+L)\xd7mean to cover the review+lead period; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to reflect aggregated variability. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with historical demand while preserving caution about possibly delayed shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent historical weekly demand sample mean ~111 units (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=534 (sum of orders placed P1-P4 =125+132+139+138). No concluded arrivals recorded for any prior orders (Periods 1-4), so actual lead time is uncertain; could be delayed or lost shipments. To avoid overreacting to potentially lost shipments without confirmed conclude messages, use promised lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies its standard safety stock and cap calculations: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level with holding cost while we wait for concluded arrival evidence.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-4 (125,132,139,138) have not concluded by Period 5 (no arrivals recorded) \u2014 sustained missing arrivals over 4 periods; possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Historical weekly demand samples: [110,102,105,123,115], mean=111. On-hand=34, in-transit=460. Period 5 conclude confirmed the Period 1 order (125) arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time matches the promised 4. No sustained demand regime change observed. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times). Use default forecasting (all-sample mean) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, ensuring base-stock reflects 5-period demand and variance while the cap limits order size against steady supply.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). On-hand=91, in-transit=410 \u2014 pipeline looks sufficient to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Historical weekly demand samples mean=111 (2019 Jan) and recent week demands are mixed but not a sustained regime shift. I choose L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed =4). I choose mu_hat default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to produce a stable base-stock (captures multi-period coverage without overreacting to short-term noise). sigma_hat default provides volatility scaled for the review+lead horizon. These choices prioritize service (reasonable base stock for 5-week coverage given confirmed L) while using holding cost in the OR formula to temper overstock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3990.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1-P3 arrived with W=4). On-hand=19, in-transit=337 (covers upcoming arrivals including P4 order likely arriving this period). Demand history shows no sustained regime change (recent spike in P7=211 is single-period). I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4; use default demand-wide mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) because no sustained demand shift warrants recent-only or explicit forecasts. This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to historical mean while the calculated lead time accounts for confirmed actual LT and reduces risk of under-ordering given prior missing arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=69, in-transit=369. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). I set L by averaging observed lead times to capture confirmed LT=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples; this balances service level (using observed LT and full-sample mean) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=63, in-transit=485 -> ample pipeline. Demand history (weeks in samples) averages ~111 (samples: 110,102,105,123,115). Given confirmed LT=4, use calculated L to reflect observed reality and keep mu/sigma as defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by targeting the base-stock from full historical demand while respecting observed lead time and existing large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Earlier missing arrivals (P1-P4) resolved; no new sustained anomalies. To reflect confirmed actual lead time use calculate (average observed lead times=4). Demand forecast uses population history (default) so backend computes (1+L)*mean across samples; volatility uses default. This avoids triggering extra orders while a large pipeline is en route and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1-P8 arrivals). Demand recent sequence shows a one-off spike (Period 7=211) but subsequent 5 periods (P7-P11) average ~100 units/week; no sustained upward regime. On-hand=65, in-transit=469 (ample pipeline). To reflect confirmed lead time I request the OR engine compute L from observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest regime while avoiding the single-period spike influence; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to match recent volatility. This yields a (1+L)-period demand forecast tuned to current demand levels and keeps safety stock responsive without overstocking given large pipeline and low holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19).

Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=179, in-transit=510. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived with 4-period lag); earlier missing arrivals resolved. Pipeline + on-hand (689) comfortably covers several weeks of demand but we keep standard demand estimate. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, giving a conservative base-stock that balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-13. Recent observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent across multiple concluded orders). On-hand=297, in-transit=343 provides substantial coverage, but demand over the last 5 concluded periods (57,41,105,56,49) averages ~61.6/week. To capture the recent regime and limit holding costs, set L via calculation (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent demand regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps base stock responsive to the current lower-average demand while the OR cap limits order sizes to avoid excess holding costs given ample pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline (569) slightly exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (~555), so no urgent emergency order needed. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service level vs. holding cost given high on-hand/pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Historical weekly demand samples (110,102,105,123,115) produce a mean ~111. On-hand=317 + in-transit=247 => pipeline total 564, which roughly matches the default (1+L)*mean = 5\xd7111=555, so inventory currently covers ~5 periods. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history, so I use default lead time and default demand statistics (no recent sustained regime change detected). These defaults let the OR backend compute base_stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff and the capped ordering policy.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=506, in-transit=67. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (multiple orders with W=4), and earlier multi-period missing arrivals resolved once (no new sustained losses). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). Demand parameters use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable baseline given no detected demand regime shift. This balances service level (use observed L) with holding cost conservatism given current high on-hand stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=458, in-transit=89. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (multiple confirmations), so we trust actual lead time=4. No sustained demand regime change detected (recent demands remain similar to historical samples). To let the OR engine compute base-stock using full-sample statistics and the confirmed lead time, set L by calculation from observed lead times and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (i.e., (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps service level high (profit/holding ratio implies high fill-rate) while relying on full-sample volatility for appropriate safety stock, and it avoids overreacting to short recent noise or intermittent missing arrivals.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent realized demand has fallen sharply versus the Jan samples: last 5 periods demand = [20,45,19,12,24] (avg=24). On-hand=465 + in-transit=59 provides ample cover now. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods. I set L to "calculate" to use the observed average lead time (reflecting confirmed LT=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the most recent 5 demand observations) so the backend base-stock reflects the new, persistent low-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15): recent demand has fallen sharply and persistently vs Jan baseline (Periods 17-21 avg = 24 units vs Jan mean \u2248111). Lead time has consistently been 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=463, in-transit=49 \u2014 ample coverage versus current low demand. I set L to use the promised lead time (default=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 17-21) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower variability. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap ordering while relying on observed lead time stability; they avoid overstock given the sustained drop in demand and moderate holding cost (H=$1) versus profit ($19).

P19\u219223), so set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time. Demand has fallen sharply vs Jan samples; recent periods 17-23 show low, stable demand (20,45,19,12,24,12,12) indicating a new low-demand regime. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. This keeps orders small to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining high service level implied by profit/holding ratio and copes with confirmed 4-period lead time and earlier delayed shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): recent demand has shifted down sharply (Periods 17-24 avg \u224819.25 vs Jan avg \u2248111). On-hand=487, in-transit=3 \u2014 inventory is ample relative to current demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history; use promised/default L. Set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the new low-demand regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat based on recent volatility (N=8). This reduces ordering to match the sustained lower demand and limits holding costs while preserving service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=470, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 matches). Demand has shifted down sharply starting around Period 17; recent demands (P17-P25) are much lower than Jan samples. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actuals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 17-25) to capture the new low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 to capture recent lower volatility. These choices reduce unnecessary orders and holding cost while preserving service under the new low-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 17 with a confirmed regime shift noted at Period 22 (recent avg ~24 vs historical Jan avg ~111). Last 5 periods (P22\u2013P26) demand = [12,12,12,10,20], avg \u224813.2 \u2014 I use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect this sustained low-demand regime. Actual lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods (confirmed many times), so I keep the promised/default lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given very low current demand and high on-hand inventory (435, in-transit 0). This balances service level and holding cost by shrinking forecasted (1+L)-period demand and estimated volatility to recent behavior.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has shifted sharply downward since Period 17 (typical weekly demand now ~22 units vs Jan mean ~111). On-hand=403, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand stock relative to current low demand, so orders should be sized to reflect the new low-demand regime and avoid holding cost. Lead time evidence (multiple concluded arrivals) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; use calculated L. For demand forecast use recent_N over the low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201327, N=11) to capture the sustained lower mean and volatility, which reduces base_stock and prevents excess ordering given large on-hand. sigma_hat also from recent_N (N=11) to reflect observed reduced variability. These choices balance service level (cover L+1 periods of current low demand) against holding cost given high on-hand.

Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has shifted down sharply vs. Jan historical samples: last 12 periods (P17-P28) avg \u224822.3 units/week (regime length=12). On-hand=376, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory today, so we lower forecast to recent regime to avoid excess holding cost. Set L to promised (default=4).

Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods when orders concluded. To reflect the new low-demand regime, I use a recent-N demand estimate over the detected recent regime (periods 17\u201329) so the OR engine sizes base-stock for current low volumes while keeping lead time estimation data-driven.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Periods 17\u201330 (examples: P17\u201321 avg \u224824; P26\u201330 demands 35,32,27,21,32; recent avg \u224829). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. On-hand is healthy (323) and no in-transit. To align the OR engine with the persistent lower-demand regime, I use recent data for demand mean and volatility (so the base-stock reflects current low demand) and keep lead time at the promised/default value. This reduces unnecessary ordering and holding cost while preserving service. No new carry-over insights to record.

Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so infer L using observed history. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent samples (most recent 15 weeks from the new regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock and avoids excessive holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=213, in-transit=0. Historical lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods; no evidence contradicting promised LT. Recent demand has risen over the last 3 periods (Periods 30-32 demands = 32,50,60; avg \u224847.3) versus the low regime (~24) observed earlier, so I treat this as a new short-run regime. To make the OR backend responsive to the recent uptick while keeping lead-time assumptions unchanged, I set L to default (promised=4), use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (respond to rising demand) against holding cost given a healthy on-hand position and zero in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand in Periods 30-32 = 47.3 vs prior low regime avg \u224824 (+96%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent demand shows a sharp spike in Period 33 (169) on top of a rising trend from Periods 30-32 (32,50,60). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=44, in-transit=71. To capture the emerging higher-demand regime while retaining confirmed LT=4, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility to incorporate the three-week rise plus the latest spike (Periods 30-33). This balances service level (captures increased demand) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to the most recent regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Observed sustained lead times = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand moved to a higher regime starting Period 30 (demands in Periods 30-34 = [32,50,60,169,152]; recent spike). I set L to calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (most recent 5 periods), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture volatility in this recent window. This biases the base-stock toward meeting the recent spike while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability; given on-hand=0 and in-transit=251, these parameters let the OR backend compute orders that cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while accounting for holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36).

Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals when concluded; use promised/default lead time. To capture the new higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 samples) so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect the recent regime while keeping L at default to avoid over-adjusting for transient delays.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 30 (sustained higher weekly sales vs earlier low regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=646 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no arrivals visible this period. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods, so use observed-average lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent samples since the changepoint at Period 30 (regime length 7 periods: P30\u2013P36) => N=7 for demand mean and volatility. These settings bias the base-stock toward meeting the higher recent demand while the OR cap will limit excessive single-period orders given existing large in-transit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=627. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1..P33 concluded with W=4); use calculate to let backend confirm average observed LT. Recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 33: demands P33-P37 = [169,152,137,98,143], sustained 5 periods with high mean (~140). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new high-demand regime and avoid stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=19, holding=1). This raises base_stock to meet elevated demand while sigma estimate reflects recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=29, in-transit=616. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand regime changed around Period 33: demands in Periods 33-38 = [169,152,137,98,143,151] (elevated vs earlier low regime). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (the post-changepoint regime length) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent sustained demand regime, balancing service level for the recent high demand while limiting extra holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has rebounded from the low-summer regime: last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 35-39) = [137, 98, 143, 151, 109], mean \u2248127.6; volatility elevated. On-hand=117, in-transit=571 (large pipeline covers multiple weeks). No new evidence of lost shipments; historical lead time confirmed at 4. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and current variability, set L to default (use promised lead time=4), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks). This balances service (avoid stockouts during rebound) against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=221, in-transit=408. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 repeatedly; promised lead time remains appropriate. Recent demand shows a higher regime since Period 30 with elevated weekly sales but a downward trend in the last several weeks; to balance service vs holding cost I target the most recent demand behavior. Set L=default (use promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 5 weeks' demand (react to the recent decline from earlier spike) so the backend computes base_stock and cap from current short-term demand volatility and mean, avoiding excess holding while preserving service.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=179, in-transit=419. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5 onward). Demand has shifted up starting Period 33 (sustained higher weekly sales since P33). To capture the current higher-demand regime, set L to promised default (4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent regime length (Periods 33-41 = 9 periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most relevant samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) while limiting excess holding by using only recent data rather than the older high-Jan baseline; using default L keeps ordering timing aligned with confirmed lead time and reduces risk from presumed lost shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). History shows consistent observed lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4); promised lead time = 4 \u2014 use default L. Demand has shifted upward since Period 33 (regime change around P30\u201333); recent demand (Periods 33\u201342) is higher and more volatile than the Jan 2019 samples. On-hand=133 + in-transit=396 provides substantial coverage, but to align the OR engine with the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the last regime (N=10 covers P33\u2013P42). This increases target base-stock to meet higher service needs while sigma_hat recent_N captures the elevated variability. These choices respect confirmed lead time and help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost by using up-to-date demand mean and volatility estimates.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=203, in-transit=445. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning at Period 30 (Periods 30-43 show higher, more variable weekly demand vs earlier low regime). To reflect the recent higher-demand regime and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 33\u201343). This raises target base-stock to protect service during high demand while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures increased variability, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weeks show elevated/volatile demand due to holiday season (Periods 41-45 demands = 94,215,82,53,59; recent 5-week avg ~100.6). On-hand=189, in-transit=504 (total pipeline=693) \u2014 ample coverage but demand has shifted vs early-year samples. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To capture the current holiday demand regime while the OR backend uses promised L=4, I request the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) to confirm 4; use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat matches the recent holiday mean across the review+lead horizon; and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service during peak with holding cost awareness given already-large pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand (Periods 37-46) averaged ~103.7 units/week, similar to historical Jan samples; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=298, in-transit=412 (pipeline healthy). I select L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with observed confirms. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated/volatile post-Period-33 regime (periods 37-46 mean \u2248103.7) so mu_hat reflects current demand level over the (1+L) review+lead window. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances service (using recent demand and volatility) against holding cost given holding is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).
