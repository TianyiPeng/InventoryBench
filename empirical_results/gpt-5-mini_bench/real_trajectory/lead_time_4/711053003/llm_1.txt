Current period indicator = 47, consistent with the recent higher regime. I adopt a short-term forecast ~35 units/week to capture recent uplift while being conservative about volatility. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals in history to contradict promised lead time. No in-transit inventory. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Decision must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period's demand occurs after ordering). e) Order logic: Target cover = forecast_per_period * (L+1) = 35 * 5 = 175 units. To be slightly conservative on exposure to holding cost, I reduce to 160 units while still covering multi-week demand and allowing some safety for the observed elevated regime. Order placed = 160.",

Demand analysis: recent demands P42\u2013P45 = {126,53,35,47} with the most recent 3 weeks P43\u2013P45 avg = 45/wk, well below earlier mid-year peaks. Use history to infer lead time: multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 403 + in-transit 50 = 453 units. Using conservative forecast = 45\u201365 units/week; cover (L+1)=5 weeks \u2192 required supply \u2248 225\u2013325 units. Current pipeline already exceeds that; excess inventory would incur $1/unit/period holding cost. Risk: lead time =4 is confirmed so ordering now would arrive after the holiday; no upside to adding inventory. Final order logic: place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost while on-hand + in-transit comfortably covers next (L+1) weeks of expected demand.",
