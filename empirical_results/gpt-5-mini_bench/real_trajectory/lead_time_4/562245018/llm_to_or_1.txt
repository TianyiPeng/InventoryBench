Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 562245018 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit; profit $4, holding $1. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable demand with increasing trend but only 5 samples\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift. Use promised lead time and population defaults so the OR backend computes base-stock from all available samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given zero inventory and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show weekly sales around 101\u2013157 with mean used by default. On-hand=0, in-transit=158 (Period1 order) but Period1 conclude reported arrived=0 \u2014 one-period non-arrival is insufficient to confirm lead-time change. I therefore use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This balances service level (using full historical mean) while avoiding premature escalation of safety stock due to a single missed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized weekly demand (Period1=150, Period2=177) is noticeably above earlier historical mean (~120). On-hand is 0 and in-transit=323. Promised lead time is 4 and there are no concluded arrivals yet, so no confirmed lead-time change. To bias forecast toward the recent higher demand while remaining conservative, I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (captures last 3 observed weeks: 2019-02-04:157, P1:150, P2:177). I also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Keep L at default (promised lead time=4) since no concluded arrivals indicate a lead-time shift. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the recent demand uptick while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level with holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical weekly sample mean from provided data = 119.8 units; with promised lead time (default L=4) the (1+L) horizon demand = 5\xd7119.8=599. In-transit (508) is below the 5-period expected demand, but no concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change (orders placed in P1\u2013P3 have not yet concluded). Be conservative: keep L at promised value, use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock and caps using full-sample statistics. This balances service level (covers multipeiod demand) while allowing OR engine to account for observed variance and the promised lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=693 which equals sum of prior orders (158+165+185+185). These orders were placed in Periods 1-4 and, with promised L=4, would arrive during Periods 5-8 and will only be visible in conclude messages later \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence to change lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (101,101,117,123,157) give mean=119.8. I use default methods: keep L at promised lead time, and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting arrival confirmation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $602.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5) has been ~150-177; on-hand=6, in-transit=592 so pipeline is large but arrivals have just begun. Observed concluded arrival shows at least one 4-period lead-time sample, so use calculated lead time. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand samples (most relevant for imminent demand over review+lead). This balances service (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded messages show orders placed on Period 1 and Period 2 arrived with lead_time=4; on-hand=23, in-transit=606. I set L to calculate (use observed lead times) to reflect confirmed lead time=4. For demand I use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which equals 5\xd7mean(101,101,117,123,157)=599, capturing the historical weekly demand scaled over review+lead period. For volatility I use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to let the OR engine compute safety stock from historical variance. These choices keep parameters consistent with observed arrivals (no change to promised lead time), provide sufficient pipeline coverage given large in-transit, and avoid overreacting to temporary variation while the system confirms further patterns.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=547. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Demand history shows one large spike in Period 7 (366) but not yet a sustained regime change. To avoid overreacting to a single spike while the pipeline is large, use promised/default lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation with stable mu/sigma estimates. This balances service (large pipeline + observed LT=4) against holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=637 (matches orders from P5-P8: 57+179+126+275). Promised lead time=4; concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 in prior history, so keep default lead time. Recent demand shows a marked uptick in the last three concluded periods (P6=148, P7=366, P8=235) indicating a possible new higher-demand regime; I use recent_N=3 to let the backend base mu_hat on the most recent regime and to capture increased variability for sigma_hat. This balances higher service level (reduce stockouts given recent surge) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to recent data rather than all historical samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1011. Historical demand shows a clear uptick starting Period 7 (P7-P9: 366,235,160) vs earlier periods (P1-P6 mean\u2248158.7). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages. To capture the recent higher demand regime, I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (uses P7-P9). Keeping L as default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals support LT=4. These choices bias the base-stock upward to improve service during the new higher-demand regime while the sigma_recent captures increased variability for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand increased from 158.67 (Periods 1-6) to 253.67 (Periods 7-9), +60% (evidence: P7=366, P8=235, P9=160).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand regime increased starting Period 7 (P7=366, P8=235, P9=160); recent regime length = 3. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will equal 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses mean and std of P7\u2013P9 across the (1+L) review+lead window). This raises target base-stock to better cover the sustained spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility; together they trade higher service level for additional holding cost but avoid lost sales given large in-transit and confirmed longer lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10, P7->P11). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 7 (P7-9 spike); recent periods P7-11 show elevated and more variable demand. Current inventory: on-hand=5, in-transit=1132 (large pipeline covering many periods). I set L to default (use promised lead time=4) because observed lead time matches promise and is stable. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 7-11) to capture the new higher regime while keeping responsiveness. For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect increased variability in the same window. These choices focus the OR backend forecast on the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large pipeline reduces urgency to inflate orders; using recent samples prevents under-forecasting from old low-demand periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 7 (P7-9 spike; elevated mean since P7). Current on-hand=123 and in-transit=957 \u2014 pipeline ample versus recent demand. I keep L at the promised/default (4) to match confirmed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 7-12) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I use sigma recent_N with N=6 to measure volatility within the same recent regime. These choices focus the OR backend on the post-changepoint demand level while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=411, in-transit=624. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 7 (higher mean). Pipeline + on-hand (1035) covers multiple periods but demand remains elevated. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 7-13) so mu_hat captures the higher mean; similarly use recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock toward the newer higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimates aligned with recent observations, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed L=4 and elevated demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Confirmed actual lead time = 4 from concluded history (P5,P6 arrivals). Current on-hand=726, in-transit=290 \u2014 ample cover, but recent demand (Periods 11-14 = 152,157,143,111) is lower than the earlier spike. To reflect the most recent regime and avoid excess holding cost, use the promised/default lead time and base mu/sigma on the last 4 observed periods (captures current lower demand and recent variance). This keeps service while reducing inventory risk versus using the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=630, in-transit=290 => pipeline=920. Recent demand regime (Periods 7-15) shows elevated but waning demand; recent 9-period mean demand \u2248174 units/week so (1+L)*mean \u22485*174=~871 units, so current pipeline slightly exceeds 5-period coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4. I choose L=default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the confirmed regime shift starting Period 7. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders to recent higher demand while recognizing current ample pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/06/03). On-hand=666, in-transit=295 \u2192 healthy buffer but demand regime increased from Period 7 onward. Historical concluded lead times = 4 (consistent). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm =4). Demand regime changepoint at Period 7 (sustained higher demand through Period 16); I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (Periods 7\u201316) so (1+L) scaling reflects the post-change mean/volatility. This raises target base-stock to protect service while keeping cap constraints in mind and avoiding excess safety stock given high on-hand inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=705, in-transit=211 (pipeline total=916) and confirmed lead time=4 periods from history. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen from earlier spike; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 12-17) = [157,143,111,96,64,59], mean \u2248105. With (1+L)=5 this implies ~525 demand across review+lead \u2014 current pipeline (916) comfortably covers this, so we should keep promised lead time and use a recent-demand estimate to reflect the post-spike lower regime and avoid excess holding. Set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 (capture last 6 periods), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility and let the OR backend cap orders to limit holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17): on-hand=742, in-transit=119. Recent realized demand has fallen for several periods (P15-18: 96,64,59,55). Promised lead time has been confirmed historically as 4. I choose L=default (use promised L=4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new low-demand regime (uses P15-18). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent low volatility. Given on-hand + in-transit >> forecast (5-period demand), we avoid increasing targets and let backend cap orders appropriately to limit holding cost while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand decline at Period 15-18: avg=68.5 vs prior Period 7-14 avg=184 (\u221263%), sustained for 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=5). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture current volatility. This keeps base-stock conservative (high service target q=0.8 given profit/holding) while avoiding excess new inflows into large on-hand stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent demand has remained in the lower regime since Period 15 (demands P15-20 = 96,64,59,55,57,33; mean \u224860.7), a sustained drop vs earlier high regime. On-hand=757 + in-transit=14 \u2192 pipeline=771, which comfortably covers several weeks at recent demand levels (\u22485*(60.7)=~303 units for review+lead). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 4 periods. I therefore set L using observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent low-demand regime (use last N=6 samples) so the OR backend computes a lower base stock aligned to the new regime and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent periods show a sustained low-demand regime since Period 15 (demands P15-21 = 96,64,59,55,57,33,24; recent avg ~55\u201369). On-hand = 747, in-transit = 0 (large on-hand buffer vs current low demand). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use observed lead-time estimate. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set demand forecast using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (captures reduced mean), and match volatility to the same window. This keeps base_stock low while acknowledging confirmed L=4 and avoiding excess ordering given high on-hand inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=706, in-transit=0; profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 15. To avoid overstock while meeting near-term low demand, keep promised lead time and base demand forecast on the most recent 8 periods (Period15-22). Chosen methods: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to reflect the recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. These parameters reduce order quantity vs using the earlier high-demand mean, lowering holding cost while matching current demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent sustained low-demand regime from Periods 15-22 (avg\u224853.6) continues; on-hand=643, in-transit=0 so inventory is ample vs current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 4. To avoid overstocking given the prolonged low-demand regime, set L to default (promised=4) and forecast demand using the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 15-22) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to the current lower demand and reduces unnecessary ordering/holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=598, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 15 (P15-24 mean \u2248 59 units/week vs prior 184), so use recent data to size replenishment conservatively. Promised lead time is confirmed historically as 4 periods (no new evidence to change). I set L=default to use promised 4. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 15-24) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; same recent_N N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to current lower demand and reduces overstock/holding cost risk given large on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 15 (sustained: P15-25 avg \u2248 55); recent weeks P24-25 = 45,45 confirm no rebound. On-hand=553, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs weekly demand (~50s). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods and no new late/lost shipments observed, so keep promised L. To align the OR engine with the current low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility, using the last 11 periods (P15\u2013P25) where the low regime persisted (regime_length=11 \u2192 N=11). This keeps base_stock small and reduces holding cost while preserving service for the observed low-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 15 (periods 15-26 avg=53.0). On-hand=499, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for current low demand but we must size forecasts to the low regime to avoid excess holding cost. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Therefore: use L default (promised 4) to align with confirmed behavior; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 15-26); set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock toward the current demand level and limits unnecessary orders while maintaining service given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline sustained through Period 15-26: avg=53.0 vs prior Period 7-14 avg=184 (\u221271.2%), evidence: P15=96,P16=64,P17=59,P18=55,P19=57,P20=33,P21=24,P22=41,P23=63,P24=45,P25=45,P26=54

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=446, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time confirmed at 4 periods and a sustained demand decline from Periods 15\u201326 (low-demand regime). To avoid overstock while meeting near-term demand, keep promised lead time (default=L=4) and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 15\u201326) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent low-demand samples, reducing target base stock and cap exposure given high on-hand and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=409, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock relative to current low weekly demand; no arrivals expected. Use promised lead time (default) since historical concludes consistently confirm L=4 and there is no new evidence of change. For forecasting, use recent_N over the sustained low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 samples (Periods 15-28) so backend builds a base-stock appropriate to the lower demand and reduces holding cost exposure.

I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed lead time, and use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current low-demand regime so the OR backend reduces replenishment and holding costs while maintaining service.

Keep promised lead time (no new LT evidence). For demand forecast use recent_N over the low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering: selected N=16 (Periods 15-30) per changepoint at Period 15. Use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce target base_stock to match sustained lower demand and limit holding cost given high on-hand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 15; on-hand=280, in-transit=0 so current stock covers many weeks at current demand. Many concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4, so keep L as promised (default). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (Periods 15-31, length 17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and volatility rather than the historical high regime. This reduces over-ordering while maintaining service. The backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 17 samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline sustained through Period 15-31: avg=50.29 vs prior Period 7-14 avg=184 (\u221272.7%), evidence: P15\u2013P31 demands = [96,64,59,55,57,33,24,41,63,45,45,54,53,37,35,33,61] (17 periods)

I set L to default (promised=4) since observed lead time matches promise. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the sustained low-demand regime, reducing orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service. This balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by shrinking base stock to recent demand levels and tightening safety stock around observed low variability.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history: long multi-period demand decline from Periods 15\u201331 (avg ~50) with two recent higher demands P32=101 and P33=254 (only 2 periods of high demand, not yet sustained). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods in history (multiple confirmed arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=84 (covers part of upcoming demand). Because the apparent low-demand regime (15\u201331) is still the dominant sustained pattern and the recent spike is short (2 periods), I keep the backend defaults so the OR engine uses full historical sample statistics and the promised lead time. This balances avoiding overreacting to a short spike (which would raise holding costs) while relying on confirmed LT=4 evidence embedded in concludes. Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute base stock and capped orders with its calibrated service-level formula.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=315. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods; demand has shifted down starting Period 15 and remained low through Period 31 (P15\u2013P31 mean \u224850.29 vs prior P7\u2013P14 mean \u2248184, \u221272.7%). Given confirmed LT=4 and a sustained low-demand regime, I keep L at the promised value to match observed arrivals but forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (to avoid overordering while 315 units are already in transit). Methods chosen: L=default (use promised lead time), mu_hat=recent_N with N=17 to reflect P15\u2013P31 low-demand average across the review+lead horizon, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=17 to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base stock and prevents excess holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=455 \u2014 pipeline is sizable. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 4 periods. Recent demand jumped starting Period 32 (P32\u2013P35 demands = [101,254,175,159], avg=172.25) versus prior low regime (P15\u2013P31 avg=50.29). I set L to default (promised 4, confirmed by history). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (capture the new higher-demand regime reflected in the last 4 concluded periods). Volatility also set recent_N N=4 to reflect recent dispersion and avoid underordering. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to meet the new demand spike while the large in-transit volume will cap orders via the backend cap and limit excess holdings.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg demand increased from 50.29 (Periods 15\u201331) to 172.25 (Periods 32\u201335), +242% (evidence: P32=101,P33=254,P34=175,P35=159).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=728. Historical concluded lead times consistent at 4 periods (multiple arrives show W=4). Demand regime increased starting Period 32 (P32\u2013P35 high: 101,254,175,159; P36 demand 124). To capture this recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (uses P33\u2013P36 data). Keep L as default (promised 4) since concluded evidence matches promised lead time. This raises base_stock to meet the elevated short-term demand while sigma from recent volatility moderates service-level z; in-transit stock is large so the OR cap will prevent excessive ordering.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand elevated since Period 32 (P32\u2013P37 = [101,254,175,159,124,100]) versus prior low regime (P15\u2013P31). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (most recent 6 demand samples) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock while sigma reflects recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but zero on-hand) against holding cost.

Demand regime change detected at Period 32 (higher demand from P32\u2013P38); I use recent_N over the most recent regime to capture this shift. Set L by "calculate" to lock in observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to "recent_N" with N=7 (regime P32\u2013P38 length=7) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the recent high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at L=4). Demand has moved through several regimes: prolonged low demand (P15\u2013P31), sharp uptick at P32\u2013P35, and mixed but elevated activity in recent weeks (P36\u2013P39 demands = 124,100,187,109). On-hand=75, in-transit=706 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed lead time and emphasize recent demand behavior while avoiding overreacting to older regimes, I set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime window. Chosen methods: L=calculate to use concluded lead-time evidence; mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 8 demand observations (captures the recent rebound and variability); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This balances service (using recent higher demand) with holding cost given the large existing pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand regime (shift starting Period 32) shows elevated/variable weekly demand; last 9 periods (P32\u2013P40) demands = [101,254,175,159,124,100,187,109,132], supporting using a recent-regime estimate. On-hand=220 + in-transit=505 => pipeline=725 units, which should cover multiple upcoming (1+L)=5 weeks at the recent mean. Use promised lead time (confirmed historically as 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the post-Period-32 regime and preserve responsiveness to current volatility; this balances service (higher base stock) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio (q=0.8). No evidence of new lost shipments.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a demand regime shift starting Period 32 (avg P32\u2013P35=172.25) and that elevated demand has persisted through Period 41 (recent 10 periods P32\u2013P41 = [101,254,175,159,124,100,187,109,132,122]). On-hand=364, in-transit=355 (pipeline covers multiple periods). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To align the OR backend with the post-changepoint regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (last 10 periods since the Period-32 changepoint). This balances higher demand forecasts against holding cost given already-high inventory.

Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods; recent Period 42 demand spike (1007) appears to be an isolated event (Black Friday week) not sustained across 3+ periods. To avoid overreacting to a one-period surge and because lead time evidence remains stable, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend's base-stock policy smooths orders against long-run demand while respecting holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4; recent demand shows large volatility with very high demands in Periods 42\u201343, so I focus the forecast on the most recent regime to capture elevated short-term demand while limiting exposure to holding cost. I choose recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 observed demands (captures the recent spike/volatility without overreacting to a single period). Using default L keeps promised lead time (4) consistent with observed concluded arrivals and the OR backend's assumptions.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1730 units (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Given the very large pipeline relative to recent demand volatility and to avoid overordering while letting the OR engine compute appropriate base-stock/cap, use default methods (promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats). This leverages the backend's base_stock and cap logic and prevents issuing extra explicit increases while arrivals clear.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=39, in-transit=1614. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages). Recent weeks show extreme demand spikes in early December (P42=1007, P43=771) likely holiday-driven; subsequent large in-transit replenishment (1614) reflects reaction. To balance service during a seasonal spike while avoiding excessive extra safety stock, I keep L at the promised/default (4) since concluded history supports it; I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weight recent high demand more heavily but not overfit to a single extreme week. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the elevated volatility across the latest 8 concluded periods (includes the large spikes and variability), so the OR engine will increase safety stock appropriately. These choices prioritize service through the holiday spike while letting the large in-transit pipeline reduce additional ordering pressure.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=91, in-transit=1680. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier); large demand regime changes occurred (decline P15\u2013P31 then spike P32\u2013P35). Recent volatility (periods 32\u201346) includes very large spikes (P42=1007,P43=771,P44=88) but these are isolated; recent sustained regime was the increase beginning at P32 (P32\u2013P35). Given confirmed lead time=4, I use default L (promised). For mu_hat I use recent_N over the most recent detected changepoint regime (P32\u2013P35, length=4) to capture the elevated demand level while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods or isolated extreme spikes. Sigma_hat uses default to let the backend compute volatility across all samples (captures overall observed variance including spikes). This combination raises the base-stock to service target implied by profit/holding (high service level) while relying on recent elevated-mean evidence to avoid stockouts during the higher-demand regime; default sigma keeps safety capped by observed overall variability. On-hand + in-transit (1771 units) provides substantial pipeline cover for L+1 periods, so parameters focus on matching recent demand mean rather than emergency ordering.
