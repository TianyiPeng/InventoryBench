Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). Product is women's skinny jeans (seasonally gift/holiday relevant) so short-term elevated demand is possible around Black Friday/Christmas. Demand analysis: recent history shows extreme, short Black Friday/Cyber spikes (Periods 42\u201343) followed by reversion to ~70\u201390 units/period (P44\u2013P45). Long-run carry-over records already capture prior regime shifts and confirmed lead time=4. Lead time & pipeline: concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=73 and in-transit=706 \u2192 total available supply = 779 units. Planning horizon: with L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (Periods 46\u201350). Forecast: using recent post-spike demand ~80 units/period -> 5-period demand \u2248400 units. Even allowing a holiday uplift (up to ~120/unit) -> 600 units. Inventory assessment: current pipeline (779) > required coverage under reasonable uplift scenarios; holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4, so excess inventory is costly. No evidence of lost orders. Order decision: place no additional order to avoid unnecessary holding costs while the in-transit pipeline already provides ample coverage for 4-period lead time and near-term holiday uncertainty.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 \u2014 post-Christmas, pre-New Year week. Jeans (everyday trousers) have no major additional seasonal spike now beyond recent Black Friday/Cyber spikes in late Nov. b) Demand regime: Historic carry-over shows multiple regime shifts; most recent sustained high-regime was around Periods 33\u201335 (~196) and there were large constrained spikes in Periods 42\u201343 (1007, 771) caused by stockouts. Recent unconstrained demands after spikes are moderate (Periods 44\u201346: 88, 77, 52). c) Lead time & orders: Lead time confirmed = 4 periods (evidence in conclude messages). In-transit=556 units; no overdue/lost shipments indicated. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 171 + in-transit 556 = 727 units in system. With lead time=4, decision must cover current period demand plus next 4 periods (L+1=5). Conservative demand forecast ~100 units/period given recent moderate sales (allowing buffer for variability and holiday tail). Required cover \u22485*100=500 units. Current pipeline (727) exceeds this. e) Final order logic: No additional units needed now \u2014 avoid extra holding cost while pipeline already covers expected demand and potential short-term volatility.",
