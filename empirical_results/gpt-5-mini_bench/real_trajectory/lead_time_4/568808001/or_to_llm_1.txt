Demand outlook: recent realized demands (Periods 43-46) = 23, 53, 48, 41 \u2192 recent avg \u2248 41.25 units/period. Using L+1=5 periods of exposure, expected demand \u2248 41.25\xd75 = 206.25 units. OR recommended 18 (uses promised L and long-run history) but does not see large pipeline. Inventory decision: pipeline (280) > expected 5-period demand (\u2248206), so placing additional order risks unnecessary holding costs (holding cost = profit = $1 \u2192 high penalty for excess). Action: order 0 to avoid incurring holding costs given ample in-transit coverage; monitor upcoming conclude messages to detect any lost shipments or regime shifts before ordering again.",
