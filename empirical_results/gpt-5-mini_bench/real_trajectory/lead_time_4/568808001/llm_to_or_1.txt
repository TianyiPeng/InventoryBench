Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Product: women's tailored trousers; no on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks): [23,29,31,38,50] -> mean ~34.2. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet, so use promised lead time. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5), use defaults so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and variance across the (1+L)-period review+lead horizon. This avoids overfitting to limited data and preserves safety stock computed by OR engine.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=52 (ordered Period 1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 too few concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change vs. normal promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) give mean ~34.2. I keep L at the promised default to let the OR backend assume 4-period lead time, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (covering current+L future weeks) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical weekly demand samples show a rising mean (23,29,31,38,50) but no sustained new regime beyond these five points. Use promised lead time and aggregate-demand defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, preserving service while the lead-time signal remains ambiguous.

Date 2019-03-04. On-hand 0, in-transit 162. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~34.2/week but only 5 samples and no concluded arrivals yet (promised L=4 means orders placed in P1\u2013P3 would not be visible as arrived). No sustained changepoint in demand or confirmed lead-time shifts (insufficient evidence). Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given current lack of contrary signals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~34.2/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=190 but no concluded arrivals yet (conclude messages through Period 4 show arrived=0 for prior orders), so there is no confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the full sample set. This avoids overreacting to apparent delays until arrivals are observed in conclude messages; it balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Concluded history shows an arrival in Period 5: 52 units ordered on Period 1 with lead_time=4 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-5) = [36,60,37,51,44], mean=45.6, which is materially above the historical sample mean (34.2). I set L by "calculate" to use observed lead-time data (avg observed = 4). To capture the recent higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (uses (1+L)*mean of last 5 realized demands). For volatility, I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variance. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while the sigma choice preserves safety stock for variability; using recent_N also helps the OR backend avoid under-ordering when some shipments are delayed or in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5); Demand regime shift: Periods 1-5 avg demand 45.6 vs historical avg 34.2 (+33%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 (two observed arrivals both with lead_time=4) and a sustained higher-demand regime: recent periods average ~49 units/week vs historical 34.2 (+~44%). Current on-hand=4, in-transit=159 => pipeline=163 which is below the (L+1)-period demand under the new regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses last 5 periods). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to raise the base stock to cover the higher forecasted (L+1)-period demand while keeping volatility estimates tied to recent data so service levels balance against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has risen vs long-run: last 5 realized demands (Periods 3-7) = [37,51,44,54,49], mean=47.0 indicating a sustained higher regime vs historical mean. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods on multiple concludes (Periods 5-7), so use observed average. On-hand=15 and in-transit=163 (ample pipeline) but higher demand warrants raising forecast over historical average. Set L to calculated observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the new regime (N=5). These parameters raise base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock responsive rather than diluted by older lower-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=0, In-transit=192 (matches outstanding orders). Recent demand has risen and been sustained: Periods 1-8 demands = [36,60,37,51,44,54,49,68], avg \u224849.9. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 4, matching promised. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime (N = regime length = 8). This raises the base-stock (\u03bc\u0302) to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data ensures safety stock reflects current volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-8 avg demand 49.9 vs historical avg 34.2 (+46%)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=242 (multiple outstanding orders). Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand upswing vs historical (recent avg \u224850 over Periods 1-8). To reflect confirmed lead time I let the backend compute the observed average lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand and its volatility I use recent_N with N=8 (uses the most recent 8 demand samples/regime). This increases the base-stock and safety stock relative to historical averages, balancing lost-sales risk against holding cost given profit=holding so target service level is moderate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher demand regime (elevated avg demand over recent periods). Current on-hand=22, in-transit=189 (pipeline large relative to on-hand). To reflect the confirmed longer-run demand regime and keep service while avoiding excess safety stock, set L using observed lead times (calculate). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data to capture the sustained uptick: mu_hat via recent_N with N=8 (uses last 8 demand observations). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=8 to reflect current variability. These choices lean the OR backend toward a higher base stock driven by the confirmed demand increase while using a recent-sample variance to avoid overstating uncertainty given plentiful pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Visible history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals from P1\u2192P5 etc.). On-hand=49, in-transit=154 (ample pipeline but maintain higher target due to sustained demand upshift). Demand has been elevated and sustained (recent regime through Period 8+); I use observed lead time (calculate) and recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility to make mu_hat/sigma_hat responsive to the new higher regime and to ensure the OR backend sizes base-stock for (1+L) periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has settled above historical baseline (Periods 1-12 mean \u224847.2 vs historical 34.2); observed lead times in concluded messages are consistently 4. On-hand=56, in-transit=134 => pipeline healthy (covers multiple periods). No overdue/lost shipments currently. Set L via calculate to reflect confirmed observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures elevated demand seen since the regime shift) so the OR backend increases base-stock to protect service without overstocking on very long tails.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained ~49\u201350/wk over Periods 1\u20138 of the episode) vs historical mean 34.2. On-hand=64, in-transit=125 \u2192 healthy pipeline but demand remains elevated. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in concluded messages). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock upward to protect service level under the confirmed higher demand while using recent data to avoid being pulled by older low-demand history.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals match 4) and a sustained higher-demand regime vs historical. On-hand=13, in-transit=169 \u2014 pipeline already large but demand elevated, so forecast should use recent demand. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time average (4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent elevated-demand regime (balances responsiveness to the shift while using a stable window). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices give the OR backend an updated (L, mu, sigma) anchored to recent realized demand and confirmed lead time, improving service while containing excess inventory given the large in-transit position.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand elevated: last four concluded periods (P12-15) demands = [50,50,61,76], on-hand=0, in-transit=205. All concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4. Pipeline (205) will cover several future periods but current on-hand is zero so maintain replenishment. I set L by calculating observed lead times (matches promised 4). For demand I detect a recent upward regime (use recent_N=4) to focus the forecast on the last 4 periods (higher mean). Volatility also estimated from the same recent window (recent_N=4). These choices bias the base-stock upward to preserve service (profit=holding so balanced) while using recent volatility to limit overstock risk given elevated but variable demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Periods 12-15 avg demand = 59.25 vs prior avg 49.9 (+18.7%), sustained 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=248. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time and a sustained upward demand regime starting around Period 12 (Periods 12-15 avg=59.25, Period 16 demand=79). I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent higher-demand regime (Periods 12-15) so the OR backend will target (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the current elevated demand rather than long-run historical averages. This increases order targets to reduce stockouts during the sustained higher-demand period while the in-transit balance (248) will be reconciled by the backend ordering cap.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has remained elevated vs historical (sustained regime since Period 9, and higher around Periods 12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=284 (covers multiple future periods given L=4). I keep L at promised lead time to reflect confirmed 4-period arrivals (no evidence of further change). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the most recent 8 demand samples to set (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the base-stock up to preserve service through the proven higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

On-hand=0, in-transit=241 (covers multiple periods). Many concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=4. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 (captures the post-Period16 high-demand regime); sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid lost sales in the new high-demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holdings.

Recent demand has risen and stabilized since Period 12; I use recent samples to capture the higher regime. Set L via calculate (avg observed=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=8 (Periods 12-19) to reflect the current elevated mean/volatility; this biases base_stock up to meet (1+L) periods of demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures realized variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertain timing) against holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=260. Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history (Period 5 conclude). Recent demand has shifted upward: Periods 17-20 demand = [78,82,67,80], avg=76.75, noticeably above the prior regime (Periods 12-15 avg=59.25). To capture the current high-demand regime and ensure pipeline covers review+lead (L+1) periods, I set L explicitly to 4. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime samples, which prioritizes service during this sustained higher-demand period while the cap will limit extreme overordering. This accounts for observed arrivals (no evidence of lost shipments) and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Periods 17-20 avg demand = 76.75 vs prior avg 59.25 (+29.5%), sustained 4 periods.

Use promised lead time (default) since arrivals have matched L=4 historically. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the latest elevated regime (Periods 17-20) so the OR backend sizes base stock to meet the higher sustained demand while controlling holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=394 (several large orders placed recently). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to match observed behavior. For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N over the most recent 6 concluded demand periods (Periods 17-22) to capture the current elevated mean and volatility; apply the same recent_N window for sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a base stock that reflects the new regime and balances service level vs holding cost.

No new confirmed lead-time change (observed arrivals consistently show 4). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 4. For demand I use a recent_N window to emphasize the new, higher-demand regime; N=8 captures the most recent two months of weeks including the elevated periods 17-23. I use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend raise base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has increased sharply and become more volatile (sustained higher regimes since Periods 12+). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=64 + in-transit=308 => pipeline 372 units (covers several periods) but recent weekly demand spikes (e.g., P21=137,P22=93) mean we should forecast using the most recent regime. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current higher mean and increased variability (uses last 8 concluded demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std), balancing service against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=72, in-transit=248 (pipeline=320). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 17 (sustained higher weekly sales). To keep service during this higher-demand regime, set lead time from observed history and use recent-demand statistics over the current regime. This ensures the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while the recent-N volatility captures current variability and avoids understocking given some past arrivals variance.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand remains elevated versus historical baseline with volatile but higher weekly sales after the confirmed regime shifts (latest sustained shift around Periods 17-20). Promised lead time = 4 and concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4, so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime and short-term variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 8 demand observations (captures roughly the past two months including the high/volatile weeks). This biases the OR backend toward higher target stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures realized volatility for safety stock calculation. On-hand (153) + in-transit (183) is healthy but pipeline may be consumed by continued high demand, so recent-based forecasting is appropriate.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=118, in-transit=180. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P5 onward). Demand has been elevated vs early historical samples with variability (recent 7 demands: P21-P27 = 137,93,53,47,79,62,89; avg ~80) but no new sustained regime breach since prior recorded shifts. To keep the OR backend responsive to the most recent demand level and volatility, I set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the last 7 weeks of demand while letting the capped ordering cap still constrain extreme orders. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given sizable on-hand + pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks show sustained high demand vs historical: recent sales (Periods 17-28) cluster ~75-90/week. Current on-hand=62, in-transit=258 (pipeline sufficient for upcoming demand). Many concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher regime since Period 17 (regime length = 12 periods), giving the OR engine a demand forecast based on the last 12 samples (multiplied by review+lead 1+L). Volatility also uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given profit=holding cost parity and the clear sustained demand uplift, while sigma_hat captures recent variability so the capped order limit tempers extreme orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand elevated and volatile; last 9 demands (Periods 21-29) average ~77.7 units/week. On-hand=30, in-transit=306 => pipeline=336 units which is slightly below (1+L)*recent mean (~388), so we need a forecast that reflects the higher recent regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-mean, higher-variance regime so the OR engine orders toward a higher base stock while the capped policy limits extreme replenishment.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand remains elevated vs historical: last 5 demands (Periods 26-30) = [62,89,80,59,81], recent average \u224874.2 which is ~117% of long-run historical mean (34.2) and consistent with prior documented upshift starting Period 17. On-hand=27 + in-transit=281 provides strong pipeline but lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher regime (recent 5-period mean); use same recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward a base stock sized for the current high-demand regime while keeping safety tuned to recent variability; with profit=holding, target service quantile is 0.5 so we avoid excess inventory beyond recent demand signal.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been well above historical: sustained regime shifts recorded through Period 21 with higher means; latest weeks (Periods 28-31) show elevated demand (80,59,81,90) and pipeline is large (in-transit=293, on-hand=0). Promised lead time remains 4 and concluded arrivals consistently show actual LT=4, so use default (promised) lead time. To capture the elevated, sustained demand regime, set mu_hat using a recent_N window that covers the current high-demand regime (use N=16 to span Periods 17\u201332 regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while the OR backend caps order size; using recent samples prevents understocking given observed sustained increases and accounts for holding cost by relying on backend's q tradeoff (profit=holding cost -> q=0.5).

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 17 (previous insight: avg ~76.75); to capture this sustained higher demand I use a recent-window covering the current regime. Set L=default (promised=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=16 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 16 demand samples (captures the Period 17+ regime). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 to reflect recent demand volatility. This increases target base-stock to preserve service during elevated demand while sigma based on recent variance controls safety stock to limit excess holding cost given $1 profit=$1 holding.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17; recent weeks show elevated and more volatile demand (including a single extreme of 129 in Period 33). To keep service while avoiding excessive holding, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast using recent data to capture the current elevated regime. I select recent_N=8 to use the last 8 demand observations (captures the most recent regime while smoothing single-week spikes). Apply the same recent_N=8 for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings instruct the OR engine to size base stock to recent elevated mean and increased variability while relying on the backend cap to limit single-order size given lead time.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (supply arriving in future periods). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile, but prior carry-over insights already record multiple sustained upward regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint convincingly starts since Period 21. To let the OR engine apply its base-stock math using the full historical demand estimate and standard volatility, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This balances service level (captures demonstrated higher means via history) against holding cost while relying on the engine's capped ordering rule given the large in-transit pipeline.

I set L via calculate to let the backend confirm observed lead time from concluded arrivals (all observed lead times =4). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical sample given the sustained higher-demand regime already documented and balances service level vs holding cost with the engine's profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=74, in-transit=195. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods 22-36) remains elevated versus the original historical baseline but shows volatility and no new sustained upward regime beyond prior confirmed shifts. To keep the OR engine responsive to the elevated recent demand while respecting confirmed lead time, I set L to default (promised = 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 15 demand periods (Periods 22-36) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, capturing the current elevated mean and recent volatility and thereby balancing service-level (avoid stockouts with pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 17 (multiple confirmed shifts culminating in elevated demand); lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history. On-hand=99 + in-transit=225 => pipeline=324, which covers multiple future periods but demand remains elevated. I keep L at promised/default (confirmed =4) and use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR backend base_stock reflect the most recent sustained high-demand regime (N=20 captures the recent high-demand window while respecting the N cap). This balances service (higher safety stock) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=170, in-transit=158. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has varied but no new sustained regime shift since Period 21 insights. Inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 328) comfortably covers several weeks of demand. To let the OR backend use its historical sample-based estimates while respecting promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the engine computes lead time = promised and demand moments from all samples.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent observed lead times are consistently 4 periods. Recent demand has declined from prior peaks: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35-39) = [45,44,42,48,38], avg ~43.4. On-hand=132, in-transit=158 (pipeline total 290) \u2014 ample cover vs (1+L) demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate could equal promised 4 but calculate documents confirmation). For mu_hat I use recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 = 5*43.4 \u2248 217). For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to capture the reduced recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to reflect the recent sustained drop, avoiding excess holding cost while keeping service for the 5-period demand window. 

Carry-over insight: Demand decline since Period 35: Periods 35-39 avg demand = 43.4 vs prior reported avg 76.75 (-43%), sustained 5 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent data shows a sustained demand decline since Period 35 (Periods 35-39 avg = 43.4 vs prior 76.75), so I downweight the long-run history. On-hand=101, in-transit=149 (pipeline total 250) \u2014 pipeline + on-hand currently covers multiple weeks so no aggressive replenishment needed. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the lower recent mean (uses Periods 36-40 demand sample window), and set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock to match the new lower demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given available pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized versus prior peaks (Periods 35-41 demands ~45,40,40 etc.). On-hand=158 + in-transit=52 gives ample coverage today; no evidence of new lost shipments (lead time historically confirmed = 4). To bias the backend toward the recent lower-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 4) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained demand decline over the last ~7 weeks. This keeps service while reducing excess holdings given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand regime: earlier sustained decline around Periods 35-39, but a large spike at Period 42 (115) makes the most recent 5-week window more representative of current volatility. On-hand=95, in-transit=3; promised lead time = 4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding -> q=0.5, z*=0), I provide demand estimates focused on the most recent 5 periods to capture the recent spike and higher variance while avoiding older high-season means. Methods chosen: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety sizing.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=72, in-transit=114. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P arrivals consistent with L=4). Demand has declined since Period 35: Periods 35-39 avg = 43.4 (sustained 5 periods) versus prior higher regime. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and base demand on the most recent regime: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the new lower-demand regime). Volatility has also shifted down with that regime, so set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent std. These parameters bias the OR engine toward lower target base-stock consistent with observed lower demand while preserving service by using recent realized mean/variance and the confirmed L=4; this reduces unnecessary holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has declined since Period 35 (carry-over insight) with some noise (notably a one-off spike in P42). On-hand=19, in-transit=184 (pipeline ample for (1+L) periods). No shipments are overdue relative to promised L=4. I keep L as default (use promised lead time). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-Period-35 lower-demand regime (regime length 10 periods: P35\u2013P44) while smoothing the single spike. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding cost equal.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods across many concluded arrivals; no new lead-time evidence. Recent demand is volatile but elevated versus original history; last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 41-45 = 40,115,23,53,48) show a short-run mean ~55.8 which better reflects immediate demand than the full history. On-hand=0, in-transit=225 covers multiple periods of demand, so use a short recent window to size the review+lead forecast and volatility to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 => moderate z). Choices: keep promised L, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend reacts to recent regime while cap limits over-ordering given large pipeline.
