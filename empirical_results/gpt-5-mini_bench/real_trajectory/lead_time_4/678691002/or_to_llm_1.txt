Current pipeline (139) already exceeds the conservative 132 target and is only modestly below the higher 210 target. Holding cost = profit ($1) makes overstocking expensive. OR recommends 80 (using promised L and historical data) but that would push inventory much higher and risk holding cost with no clear sustained demand increase.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over insight). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=108 (pipeline). OR recommends 101 using promised L and historical demand; OR cannot account for calendar effects. Recent weeks show extreme holiday spikes (Period 42 demand=123, Period 45 demand=211) indicating elevated short-term demand around 2019-12-23. With L=4, orders placed now arrive too late for immediate spike but are needed to cover a potentially sustained elevated level after the holiday. Ordering exactly OR's 101 risks stockouts if demand remains high; ordering too much hurts profit because holding cost equals profit. Given existing pipeline 108 and the OR suggestion 101 (which targets multi-week demand), I moderately increase the order to 120 units to add a small safety buffer for post-holiday elevated demand while limiting holding cost exposure. No new multi-period regime shifts meet the 3+ period significance threshold, so no carry-over insight update.",
