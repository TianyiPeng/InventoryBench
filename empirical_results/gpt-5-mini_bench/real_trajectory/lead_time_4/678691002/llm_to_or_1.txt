Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 678691002 (sports bra) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~68.4 units/week; no evidence of a sustained demand or lead-time shift (only 5 samples). Use promised lead time to avoid overfitting delayed/absent arrivals. Set L=default so backend uses promised L=4. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std, providing a standard base-stock safety buffer covering the review+lead horizon.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=176, two recent orders placed (Period1=89, Period2=87) have not yet concluded; promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals exist to suggest a different actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) have mean \u224868.4. To be conservative and because there is no evidence of a demand regime shift or lost shipments, use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes base-stock and caps consistently with its assumptions.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=261 (orders from P1\u2013P3). Promised lead time is 4 periods and no concluded arrivals have been observed yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Historical weekly demand samples mean = 68.4. To avoid overreacting to possibly delayed shipments and because there is no sustained evidence of a demand regime or lead-time change, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with promised LT. This balances service level against holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Historical demand samples (weekly): [81,48,71,68,74], mean=68.4, std\u224812.38. No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (all arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be reliably estimated from conclude messages. Use default promised lead time and default demand stats: mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let the OR backend compute base stock while preserving conservative defaults given missing arrival confirmations. In-transit (320) is slightly below default 5-period demand (\u2248342), so monitor for lost shipments in subsequent concludes.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 (total ordered reported=320) have not concluded/arrived; possible lost or severely delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=37, in-transit=232. Period 5 conclude shows the Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=4, which matches the promised lead time; orders placed in Periods 2-5 are therefore still in-transit and not yet overdue. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4. Demand history (five samples mean=68.4) supports using default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean to capture typical 5-period demand, and default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility. These choices balance service (cover ~5 weeks demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order placed P1 arrived P5; observed lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=54, in-transit=191. Historical concludes show orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=4; recent missing shipments resolved for those. I set L=calculate to use the observed lead times (avg observed=4) so the OR engine accounts for actual lead time. Demand parameters use default (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) because recent weekly demand (historical samples + recent periods) shows no sustained regime shift; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=76 + in-transit=179 equals outstanding orders from P4-P7 (59+1+46+73=179); no additional lost shipments evident. I will use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time, and default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (uses the 5 available demand samples). This balances service (use confirmed L=4) with holding cost by relying on overall-sample demand stats rather than short-term noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent weekly demand has been elevated (last concluded demands: P5=52, P6=70, P7=63, P8=81) on top of historical sample mean=68.4. On-hand=54, in-transit=183 (matches orders placed in P5\u2013P8 = 1+46+73+63 =183). Observed arrivals from orders placed in P1\u2013P4 all concluded with lead_time=4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8), so I set lead time via calculation of observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will set (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples) because the historical sample set is small but representative and recent demands, while higher, are only 4 periods of data\u2014using default balances service level vs holding cost and leverages the confirmed L=4 for the review+lead horizon. This reconciles pipeline (183) + on-hand (54) against expected demand over the (1+L) horizon.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1->P5 concluded with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=20, in-transit=265 \u2014 pipeline appears substantial and should cover multiple lead cycles. Demand history (samples from Jan 2019: mean=68.4/week) indicates baseline weekly demand ~68. With promised lead time 4 and actual lead time confirmed, I use calculate for L to let backend compute observed average lead time. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, yielding stable base-stock given confirmed L and no new sustained demand regime shift. This balances service level (using observed lead time) versus holding cost given already-large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Historical concluded lead times = 4 periods (multiple observations P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10) so actual lead time is 4. Historical weekly demand samples mean = 68.4 (samples: 81,48,71,68,74). With L\u22484 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods, so default demand forecast = 5\xd7mean = 342 units. Current on-hand(32)+in-transit(248)=280 vs. expected 5-period demand\u2248342 \u2192 ~62-unit shortfall. To target the OR engine's base-stock calculation while reflecting observed lead time, I select L by calculation (avg observed), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility over the full sample set. This yields a conservative replenishment signal to close the ~62-unit gap while respecting the backend's capped order policy and the equal profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=73, in-transit=199. Using promised/default lead time (confirmed=4) keeps OR engine and observed arrivals aligned. Demand history (five samples mean=68.4) supports using default demand scaling: mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean to cover review+lead periods; sigma_hat uses default scaling for uncertainty. This provides a balanced base-stock targeting the OR engine's service-level tradeoff given profit=holding cost, while existing in-transit plus on-hand already provides substantial coverage versus upcoming demand.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=85, in-transit=159. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders in P1\u2013P8 arrived with W=4), so use observed lead time. Demand history shows stable weekly demand around ~68 units (samples provided). To keep the OR engine aligned with confirmed lead time and broad historical demand, set L using calculated observed lead times and use default mu/sigma so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level given confirmed L=4 while avoiding overfitting to recent noise or transient missing shipments earlier.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P9 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand = 121, in-transit = 125; pipeline + on-hand (246) comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the observed 4-period reality. Demand history (samples provided) has mean ~68.4 units/week; using the default (1+L)\xd7mean captures the multi-period review+lead demand without overfitting to short-term noise. Sigma is left as default to reflect full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices tell the OR backend to target a base-stock sized to 5\xd7mean demand with standard deviation scaled for 5 periods, balancing service level (profit=holding cost) against holding costs given ample pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=114, in-transit=140. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.) and earlier missing shipments resolved; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change in recent history. Demand samples (provided) are stable; profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so a balanced service level is appropriate. Use default/promised treatment: keep L = promised (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This lets the OR engine apply its capped policy using the full-sample estimates while accounting for the 4-period lead time and current pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with many concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 4 (consistent across multiple concluded orders). Current inventory: on-hand=58, in-transit=191 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand at L=4. Given the confirmed/stable lead time, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect realized behavior. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to leverage full historical sample set (no recent changepoint detected). These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to realized lead time and historical demand, balancing service level vs holding cost while accounting for prior missing shipments now resolved.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=67, in-transit=175. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6,...P13\u2192P17). No recent evidence of lost shipments since arrivals have been concluding with 4-period lag. Demand sample set (provided historical weeks) has mean=68.4 units/week; use standard default forecasting tied to promised/observed lead time to keep calculations simple and stable. I choose L by calculation (average observed lead times = 4) so the OR engine uses the confirmed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). Current on-hand + in-transit (242 units) provides coverage vs the 5-period forecast but the OR engine will cap orders appropriately.

On-hand=71 + in-transit=167 = 238 units, which roughly covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean (~219 units). Use calculated L to reflect observed lead times=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent on-hand=46 and in-transit=137 (pipeline=183) vs. historical weekly mean demand ~68.4 (samples from Jan\u2013Feb). To respect confirmed lead time and use full historical sample set for a stable baseline, I set L using calculate (to confirm observed LT=4) and use default demand/volatility scaling so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using the established 5-period demand window) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=63, in-transit=149 => pipeline_inventory=212, which is below (1+L)\xd7mean demand (5\xd768.4\u2248342) so orders will be needed to restore target base-stock. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4) so the backend uses realized lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all historical samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean demand and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the provided samples; this is conservative given no sustained demand regime shift and balances service level vs holding cost under observed stable demand.

Demand samples (historical weekly) show stable mean; current on-hand=69, in-transit=161 (pipeline total=230). Missing shipments from early periods have since concluded and lead time confirmed at 4, so use lead-time estimate from observations. I choose L via calculate to lock in observed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples because demand appears stable and we have limited samples; this keeps safety stock driven by historical variability while the backend caps order size to avoid excessive inventory given holding cost = profit. These settings balance service level vs holding cost while acknowledging resolved delays.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=77, in-transit=163. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time (orders placed in Pn arriving in Pn+4). No new sustained demand regime change detected. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (captures the confirmed L=4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable forecast and volatility estimate given no recent changepoint. This balances service (use observed lead time) against holding cost by relying on the backend's base-stock computation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand context: stable weekly demand history with no clear recent regime shift; product is a seasonal sports bra but current summer date shows typical demand. On-hand=110, in-transit=120; pipeline plus on-hand (230) comfortably covers several weeks of demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (observed arrivals paired with orders), so set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average. No sustained demand changepoint detected, so use default demand forecast ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility. This balances service (use observed L) while avoiding overstock from overreacting to a single missed arrival (Period 23 had one missing arrival but not sustained).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand samples (seed data) average 68.4 units; no strong recent sustained demand regime change detected. On-hand=95, in-transit=127; recent history shows most arrivals with lead_time=4 but occasional single-period missing arrivals (no sustained loss signal). I choose promised/default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier promise and historical confirmations. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock while the pipeline (95+127) covers several weeks of expected demand.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; earlier missing shipments resolved (many P1\u2013P4 arrivals concluded P5\u2013P8). Demand history (seed samples mean \u224868.4/wk) shows stable weekly sales. I choose L by calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time (reflecting the confirmed 4).

On-hand = 81, in-transit = 138. Profit and holding cost equal, implying q=0.5 (z*=0). I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps parameters consistent with observed stable lead time and historical demand while letting the backend apply the capped ordering rule to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 Period 31. On-hand=66, in-transit=141. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 when shipments conclude (multiple periods), confirming actual lead time=4; earlier missing shipments were transient and subsequent arrivals align with L=4. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 4). Demand historical samples (weekly mean \u224868) are stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This keeps orders aligned with observed stable demand and confirmed lead time while avoiding overreacting to occasional zero arrivals.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand history (weeks shown) is stable with no sustained regime shift; historical samples mean \u2248 63 (from provided samples) and weekly demands in history average around that level. On-hand=70 + in-transit=149 \u2192 pipeline covers multiple weeks (good buffer). Past concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (observed repeatedly), so use inferred lead time. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default formulas so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level and holding cost using the problem's profit/holding tradeoff and the backend's capped ordering policy. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample statistics given no recent sustained demand changepoint and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand has moderated: last 5 concluded demands = [27, 31, 41, 27, 16] (Periods 28-32) \u2014 lower and more variable than the long-run sample. On-hand=112 + in-transit=115 = 227 units in pipeline, which should cover the (1+L)=5-period ahead demand at the recent mean. No new sustained lead-time or loss signal since prior insights. To adapt to the recent lower demand regime while retaining responsiveness, I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and demand volatility; keep L as default (promised lead time=4) so the OR engine uses the contract lead time unless future concluded arrivals indicate a change. This balances service (short-term demand coverage) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from the immediate recent demand pattern and its recent variability.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=81, in-transit=92 (total pipeline=173) which is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical sample mean ((1+4)*mean\u2248342), so we are currently light vs. the default coverage target. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly in conclude messages), and early missing shipments were later resolved; no new prolonged losses observed. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (confirming LT\u22484). I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set; this increases order targets to restore multi-period coverage while the confirmed LT is used to size pipeline timing.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Recent concludes show a stable observed lead time = 4 across many periods and intermittent single-period missing arrivals but no sustained loss pattern. Current inventory: on-hand=80, in-transit=130 (pipeline total 210) \u2014 ample short-term cover but still subject to 5-period demand when ordering (review+lead = 1+4). I select default lead time (use promised L=4) because concluded history consistently shows 4. I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical demand samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to compute base stock; this balances service level vs holding cost using full-sample statistics given no confirmed recent demand regime shift.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent concluded history shows a stable observed lead time of 4 periods. On-hand=112, in-transit=102 => pipeline total=214. Historical sample mean = 68.4 units/week (samples provided), so (1+L)*mean = 5*68.4 = 342 units demand over review+lead; current pipeline (214) is below that, indicating replenishment needed. Given consistent observed lead time and no new sustained regime shift, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR engine computes base-stock and capped order size using full-sample statistics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=95, in-transit=118. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4); earlier missing shipments resolved (Periods 1\u20134 arrivals showed delay) and no sustained new regime in demand. Recent single-period zero arrivals (Period 37 conclude: arrived=0) is isolated and not yet a sustained signal of lost shipments. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand stats, I use default settings so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples with L = promised lead time. This balances service (use of full-sample mean) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost and no confirmed demand shift.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand context: recent history shows stable weekly demand with observed arrivals consistently indicating actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in history). Current inventory: on-hand=128, in-transit=64 (pipeline=192 total). There have been past missing/delayed shipments but multiple concluded arrivals show lead time=4 is reliable. I choose L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time data (will reflect the sustained 4-period lead time). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical demand series for a stable base-stock target given profit=holding, balancing service level vs holding cost. With on-hand + in-transit \u2248 192 the pipeline provides coverage; defaults avoid overreacting to isolated missing shipments while calculate for L ensures lead-time is set from observed conclusions.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weekly demand has been low (Periods 35-39 demands = [12,19,17,34,25], mean=21.4). On-hand=130 and in-transit=70 \u2192 pipeline ample vs. recent demand; no new sustained lead-time shift detected. Use promised lead time (4). Forecast demand across review+lead using the most recent 5 weeks to capture current lower-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5 (implies (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*21.4 = 107). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to current demand while avoiding excess stock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=112, in-transit=62. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent history shows regular arrivals at LT=4 and no new sustained lead-time delays. Demand baseline from provided historical samples (mean=68.4/week). I choose L=default (use promised LT=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which preserves the long-run demand estimate and variance while the OR engine applies service-level cap. This balances service (protects against 4-period pipeline) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand is stable and moderate (last 8 demands: P34-41 = 30,12,19,17,34,25,26,30). On-hand=98, in-transit=93 \u2192 pipeline=191 which covers multiple weeks. Past concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (sustained evidence); no new missing-shipment pattern since prior insight. I select L by calculating average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to base (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent stable regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding overweighting older seasonal data and help the OR backend avoid excess holding given current healthy pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

No new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from available samples, providing a baseline base-stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows mostly 4-period actual lead time and a sharp demand spike at Period 42 (demand=123) that caused a temporary stockout; current inventory: on-hand=11, in-transit=128. Given confirmed/consistent lead times and no new sustained regime change, use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend retains its assumed L=4. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by review+lead) and default volatility so the backend's base-stock calculation leverages the full historical sample set while the capped-order constraint limits order size. This balances service (covers typical demand + variability) versus holding cost during the holiday period without overreacting to a single spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=2, in-transit=208. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent history shows intermittent missed arrivals but overall arrivals match promised L=4. Using default lead time keeps alignment with observed L=4. I select default demand/volatility estimates (use all samples) because there is no sustained demand regime shift in the history and available historical samples are limited; this keeps the OR engine's base-stock calibrated to long-run mean while the pipeline (208) plus small on-hand will be compared against (1+L)-period demand by the backend.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=172. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; no sustained new lead-time anomaly beyond that. Several late/missing arrivals occurred earlier but recent periods (many concludes) show regular 4-period arrivals. Given profit=holding, service quantile q=0.5 so target z*=0; use conservative defaults so OR backend uses full-sample demand statistics scaled by (1+L). I therefore select default lead time (promised=4) and default demand moments (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes base-stock from all historical samples. This balances service against holding when profit equals holding cost. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments now since pipeline=172 provides coverage.

Recent large week-on-week demand spikes (Periods 45-46) appear, but not sustained for 3+ periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand, I set L to use observed average and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost given current pipeline.
