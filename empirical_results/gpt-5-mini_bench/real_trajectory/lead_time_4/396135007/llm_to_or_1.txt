Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (45,52,45,54,47) give mean \u224848.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or evidence of lost shipments. Promised lead time is 4 periods and no observed lead-time changepoints yet. Use default lead time and default demand dispersion to let the OR engine compute base-stock from the full-sample mean and std (covers (1+L) review+lead horizon). This balances service level (use all available history) against holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). No aggressive upweighting since no seasonal or recent regime shift is evident.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand samples (45,52,45,54,47) give mean \u224848.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=56 (order from P1 not yet concluded) \u2014 no concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time; treat promised lead time as default. Using default methods: set L to promised (so (1+L)=5 review+lead window) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample history so the OR engine builds base-stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples. This keeps target inventory covering ~5 weeks of expected demand while not overreacting to a single delayed shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan): [45,52,45,54,47]. On-hand=0, in-transit=111 (orders from P1+P2); no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Pipeline (111) currently covers several weeks of demand; to avoid premature adjustments given no confirmed lead-time changes or demand regime shifts, use defaults: keep promised lead time, and use all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (using full-sample forecast) vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019): mean=48.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=175 (matches orders 56+55+64 from Periods 1-3). No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time from concluded messages; however pipeline exists. Use default lead time (promised = 4) so OR backend uses standard (1+L)\xd7mean forecast anchored to historical samples. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to keep parameters stable while unresolved shipment delays persist. This balances service level (use historical mean \xd7 (1+L)) against holding cost given holding=profit, avoiding overreacting to unconfirmed lead-time shifts.

Carry-over insight: Orders totaling 175 units (P1:56, P2:55, P3:64) remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period 3 conclude \u2014 indicates shipments delayed beyond expected or at risk of being lost; treat as confirmed sustained delay until arrivals are observed.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand mean = 48.6 (samples: 45,52,45,54,47). On-hand=0, in-transit=248 but multiple past orders (P1\u2013P4) have not arrived by their expected windows indicating sustained shipment delays. Therefore increase assumed lead time to cover delayed pipeline so the OR engine plans for more coverage; keep demand and volatility estimates anchored to historical samples (use default (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overreacting to transient demand noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent observed demands (Periods 1-5) = [49,67,76,75,73], mean=68. On-hand=0, in-transit=270; one conclude shows P1 order arrived at P5 confirming lead_time=4. Given confirmed lead time and a stable recent demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest 5 periods (captures current season/ramp). This yields (1+L)-period demand forecast based on recent mean and volatility, balancing service level vs. holding cost while accounting for the substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5 conclude)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=285; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). Demand has trended up in recent weeks (last 6 demands: 49,67,76,75,73,87) indicating a higher recent mean and elevated variability versus older samples. To reflect the confirmed lead time I use calculate for L (backend will set L=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the recent higher mean and volatility; this also guards against overstocking given holding cost equals profit by focusing orders on the up-to-date demand regime. The parameter choices account for the delayed arrivals by using observed lead time and recent demand to size pipeline replenishment conservatively.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=292 (includes earlier delayed shipments). Historical weekly sample mean=48.6 (2019 Jan samples) but demand has risen sharply and persistently since Period 2 (period demands: P2..P7 = 67,76,75,73,87,109). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 4 periods from concluded arrivals) so backend uses actual average. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new higher-demand regime (covers P2\u2013P7) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine raises base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, and the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled when arrivals are concluded.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2: recent avg (P2\u2013P7) = 81.17 vs historical sample mean = 48.6 (+67%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has shifted up (P2\u2013P7 avg=81.17 vs historical mean=48.6) and shipments from P1\u2013P4 all confirmed 4-period lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (covers upcoming demand). Set L by calculating average observed lead times (observations show consistent 4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (6-period regime P2\u2013P7). These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward higher safety stock to preserve service during the confirmed elevated-demand regime while acknowledging holding cost symmetry (profit=holding cost).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). Demand has shifted up and sustained (recent periods P2\u2013P7 avg \u224881.2 vs historical sample mean 48.6). I set L to 'calculate' to lock to observed average lead time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 6 samples P2\u2013P7). For volatility I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect increased variability in the recent regime. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the confirmed higher demand while updating safety stock for higher observed variability, balancing service level versus holding costs given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weeks show a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 2\u20137 avg \u224881.2 vs historical mean 48.6, +67%). On-hand=0, in-transit=394 (covers several future periods) and recent concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times =4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base the review+lead forecast on the new higher-demand regime (uses the last 6 demand samples). This increases target base_stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; together they reduce stockouts given confirmed LT=4 and limit excess holding by focusing on the new regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=444 (large pipeline). Historical samples and concluded periods show a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 2 (recent avg P2\u2013P7=81.17 vs historical mean=48.6). Observed lead times consistently 4 periods. I set L via calculate to reflect confirmed LT=4 from concluded arrivals. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 6 periods where elevated demand is evident) so the OR base-stock will target service under the higher demand while capping orders by the engine's cap to limit excess inventory given high in-transit levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand shifted up starting Period 2 and has been sustained through Period 12 (recent avg P2\u2013P7 = 81.17 noted in carry-over). I set L using observed data (calculate average observed lead times = 4) to reflect confirmed reality. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 6 concluded demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices steer the OR engine to a higher base stock appropriate for elevated demand while using recent variance to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=49, in-transit=493. Historical winter samples show low mean (~48.6) but recent periods (P2\u2013P7 and subsequent weeks) evidence a sustained higher-demand regime (recent average ~81). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals consistent). To capture the higher recent demand while anchoring to confirmed L=4, set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent detected regime length (6 periods of sustained higher demand) so the OR engine targets (1+L)*recent_mean and scaled recent std; this raises base-stock to reduce stockouts given large in-transit but still balances holding cost since Profit=Holding. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is needed now because arrivals have been consistent with L=4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime vs historical samples (recent avg ~81 vs historical 48.6). Current position: on-hand=61, in-transit=456 \u2014 ample pipeline but earlier multi-period delays were observed; arrivals since P5 have consistently shown 4-period lead time. To reflect the sustained higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales base stock to the new demand level while keeping L as promised (4) which matches observed arrivals; this balances service level (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=129, in-transit=372. Historical concl. messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods for multiple orders (consistent arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent sustained demand regime (Period 2\u20137 avg\u224881.17 vs historical sample mean\u224848.6) persists, so forecast should use recent data. Set L explicitly=4 to reflect confirmed lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (N=6 = observed regime length). This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma based on same window balances service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=177, in-transit=259; past confirms actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 2. To reflect confirmed LT evidence use 'calculate' so backend sets L to observed average (4). For demand I use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent regime samples since Period 2). Choose N=15 to cover the regime from P2\u2013P16. Apply the same recent_N window to sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings ensure base_stock and cap are computed from the elevated recent mean/variance while respecting observed lead time and avoiding understock given large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand regime remains elevated vs historical (earlier insight: P2\u2013P7 avg=81.17 vs hist mean=48.6). On-hand=235 + in-transit=150 = 385 units \u2014 with promised lead time ~4 (use calculated actual) this covers ~5 periods (1+L). Choose L by "calculate" because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to anchor forecast to the confirmed higher-demand regime (captures the most recent sustained regime used in prior insight). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias orders toward higher service (higher mu_hat) to avoid stockouts observed earlier, while sigma_hat based on recent variability keeps safety stock realistic given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has shifted up (recent avg ~81 vs historical ~48), sustained across multiple periods. On-hand=227, in-transit=145 (total pipeline=372) which comfortably covers ~5 periods of elevated demand; prior multi-period shipment delays were observed earlier but recent concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals. I set L=calculate to lock to the empirically observed lead time (observed repeatedly as 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses the last 6 demand samples to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to meet elevated demand while using recent variability to avoid excessive overstock given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=129, in-transit=108. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (observed arrivals confirm L=4). Demand has shifted upward vs original samples (sustained higher regime detected earlier: recent rolling demands ~81 vs historical mean ~48). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, set L via calculate (use observed lead times), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the sustained recent regime). This increases the forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to drive higher replenishment while the OR backend will cap orders; choice balances service (avoid stockouts given higher demand) against holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than long-run low historical mean.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=216. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly). Demand has been in a higher regime vs the original 2019 sample (sustained elevated weekly demand across recent periods). I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm LT=4. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime and reduce dilution from earlier low samples; N=12 captures the most recent ~3 months of weekly demand to reflect current pace. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while sigma_hat based on recent variability prevents understating uncertainty. This balances service (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and large pipeline) against holding cost.

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 2 (recent avg P2\u2013P7 = 81.17 vs historical sample mean 48.6). Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed behavior. For demand, use recent_N to capture the elevated regime; regime length ~6, so N=6. Use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias the OR base-stock upward to meet the higher demand while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and limiting excess holding by using recent data rather than the full historical sample.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=352 (multiple past shipments delayed but lead time has been consistently observed as 4). Historical sample mean=48.6 but demand has shifted upward and remained high (recent avg \u224881 across the detected regime). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, keep promised lead time and use recent data for demand: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime (N=6) to capture the elevated mean and volatility observed across the sustained shift. This prioritizes meeting higher demand while the pipeline is large.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=59, in-transit=366. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and pipeline is large; demand has been in a higher regime vs 2019 sample mean. Use observed lead-time average (calculate) to match confirmed LT=4. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated demand regime and recent variability so the OR backend raises base-stock appropriately while capping orders via its cap rule. This balances higher service-level need vs holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been well above historical sample mean (sustained high regime since Period 2 with recent avg ~81 vs historical 48.6). On-hand=152, in-transit=281 (healthy pipeline). Lead times have repeatedly concluded as 4 periods. To reflect confirmed LT=4 and the sustained higher demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand m\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using a recent-window average/volatility to capture the new regime (use N=20 to cover the sustained high-demand period while smoothing short noise). These parameters bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given high recent demand while the cap limits extreme orders and holding cost exposure.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=109 and in-transit=330 provide substantial pipeline cover. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime over the most recent 6 periods, improving forecast responsiveness while keeping volatility based on the same recent window.

Demand has shifted higher vs original 5-sample history (carry-over notes recent avg ~81.17 vs historical 48.6); to capture this regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (reflecting the documented recent regime length) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock upward to protect service level given the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been in a higher regime vs historical (recent avg ~81 vs historic ~48). On-hand=179, in-transit=178 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand (357) is healthy vs elevated demand but monitor arrivals given past delayed shipments. Lead time: concluded arrivals consistently show 4 periods; use calculated average to reflect observed reality. Demand forecast: use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (regime length 6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples. Volatility: use recent_N N=6 to capture current regime variability. These settings bias orders toward satisfying the higher recent demand while the OR backend cap prevents runaway orders, balancing service level and holding cost.

Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime vs historical (carry-over insight recorded earlier); to capture recent elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time (stable evidence); mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock up to maintain service under the higher demand regime while sigma_hat from recent samples prevents underestimation of risk and keeps cap sizing conservative given holding cost parity with profit.

Demand history includes a prior sustained uplift signal, so use recent demand for forecasting: set mu_hat via recent_N (N=6) to capture the most recent regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the current demand regime while the backend caps orders; with Profit=Holding, service tradeoff is balanced (q=0.5 -> z\u22480).

Recent demand (Periods 28-33 = 51,59,41,11,14,24) is materially lower than earlier surge; I will forecast using the most recent 6 periods to capture this downshift and reduce excess holding. Set L to default (promised=4) because concluded history confirms 4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align base-stock to the recent lower demand regime and lower volatility, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=292, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (evidence: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Earlier multi-period shipment delays were observed but recent arrivals align with promised L=4. Recent demand (Periods 29\u201334 = 59,41,11,14,24,26) is lower than the earlier high-regime; I therefore use an L estimated from observed lead times and base demand forecast on the most recent 6 periods to capture current lower-demand regime. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices avoid over-ordering given high on-hand inventory while ensuring pipeline targets cover (1+L) periods of expected demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand is high (266) and in-transit = 0; recent weekly demand is low (~26 recent weeks) so I will treat lead time as promised (4). Use recent 7 weeks to capture current low-demand regime (Periods 29\u201335) for mu and sigma to avoid over-ordering against older high-demand spikes. This keeps base_stock tied to current demand and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given ample on-hand stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=245, in-transit=0. Historical base samples mean=48.6 but recent realized demand (Periods 31\u201336) has been much lower (11,14,24,26,26,21 \u2192 avg \u224820.3), so current regime is low-demand; many earlier periods confirmed lead time = 4. To avoid unnecessary replenishment given large on-hand and low recent demand, set L using observed lead times (calculate). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (most recent 6 demand observations) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and reduced volatility based on the current low-demand regime, minimizing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=230, in-transit=0. Past long delays resolved; lead time has been confirmed as 4 historically and no new evidence of change \u2014 use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201337 = 11,14,24,26,26,21,15) shows a sustained low-demand regime versus earlier high-demand spikes; to reflect current regime I set demand and volatility using the most recent 7 weeks. This keeps base-stock conservative to avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1). Methods: L=default to respect promised lead time and confirmed historical behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=216, in-transit=0. Historical early sample mean=48.6 but recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 30. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (Periods 30\u201338) to capture the new lower-demand regime (avg \u224821.3 units/week) so the OR engine sizes base-stock for the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5). Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures recent volatility rather than older high-variance samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: recent avg (P30\u2013P38)=21.33 vs prior recent avg (P2\u2013P7)=81.17 (\u221274%), sustained for 9 periods

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 30 (avg P30\u2013P38 \u2248 21.33). On-hand=207, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for near-term low demand but avoid overstocking. Use promised lead time (default=4) since lead time previously confirmed at 4. Forecast demand using recent regime (last 9 periods since changepoint at P30) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; estimate sigma from the same recent window to capture current low-volatility regime. This reduces orders relative to historical higher mean and limits holding cost while preserving service for the sustained lower-demand pattern.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=191, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled in the low regime observed from Period 30 onward (avg ~21.3 over P30\u2013P38, sustained 9 periods); using recent data avoids overstating demand from early high regime. Promised lead time remains 4 and was previously confirmed; keep L as default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (capture the P30+ low-demand regime). This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and variability so the OR backend lowers ordering and holding given current ample on-hand inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=175, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime drop starting at Period 30 (avg ~21.33 over P30\u2013P38) that persisted through Period 41 (low teens). No recent arrivals; in-transit = 0 so no overdue receipts to reconcile. I keep L as promised (default=4) because lead time was previously confirmed as 4 and no new evidence of change. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to avoid overforecasting: use N=12 (Periods 30\u201341) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand based on the new low-demand regime, reducing excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=148, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 confirmations); recent demand regime declined starting Period 30 and has been low and stable since (avg P30\u2013P42 \u2248 21). To reflect confirmed LT=4 use calculated lead time; to capture the new low-demand regime use recent_N over the entire post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201342, regime length 13) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower demand and reduced variability. This keeps orders conservative (lower base stock) to reduce holding cost given holding=profit and large on-hand inventory while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in the low regime confirmed at Period 39 (shift starting Period 30); last 14 weeks (P30\u2013P43) average demand \u224819.6/wk, sustained for 14 periods. Lead time has been confirmed previously as 4 and promised lead time is 4; no evidence of new LT shift or arrivals in-transit. On-hand=134 vs (1+L)=5 review+lead weeks \xd7 recent mean \u224898 units, so inventory currently comfortably above the 5-week demand forecast. To keep orders aligned with the new low-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to compute pipeline targets, I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=14 (captures the sustained low-demand regime P30\u2013P43), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=14 (use recent volatility). This minimizes excess holding given profit=holding cost and preserves service by using recent regime stats.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 30 (sustained low demand through Period 44). Promised lead time=4 was previously confirmed; no new evidence to change it. To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5) and the sustained low-demand regime, I use a recent_N forecast anchored to the low-demand regime (most recent 15 periods, Period30\u201344) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility. L set to default (promised 4) so OR backend uses the correct review+lead horizon. This reduces base-stock and capping order size versus using the historical high-demand periods, lowering holding cost risk while preserving service for the current regime.

Promised lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use default promised L to keep OR engine's timing consistent. Use recent_N for demand (N=16, covering the sustained low-demand regime P30\u2013P45) so mu_hat reflects the current lower mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility.

Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 30 (avg P30\u2013P38 \u224821.33) versus earlier high regime; no current in-transit shipments to consider. Promised lead time was previously confirmed as 4, so use default lead time. To align the forecast with the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from that regime (capture recent variability and avoid overstock).
