Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand mean = 21.4 (samples: 22,11,20,13,41). Promised lead time is 4; with no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility. This keeps parameters tied to long-run data while avoiding premature adjustments given zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=41 (order placed Period 1) and no arrivals concluded yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Historical weekly samples available (22,11,20,13,41) show limited data and a single recent spike (41) that is not yet a sustained regime change. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics so the OR engine applies the standard (1+L)-horizon forecast while the pipeline arrival uncertainty is resolved in future concludes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=101. Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013early Feb) show mean\u224821.4, but two most recent periods (Period1 demand=60, Period2 demand=77) are much higher \u2014 possible demand uptick but only 2 periods (insufficient to confirm a sustained regime). No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid premature adjustments. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to moderately upweight the recent high demands while remaining adaptive if the spike is transient. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so OR backend retains conservative variability estimate. This balances service level (captures recent demand increase) against holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples average 21.4 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=204 (sum of prior orders 41+60+103). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so do not alter L. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps forecast anchored to historical mean while the pipeline (204) covers multiple periods; high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) supports the backend's service-level driven base-stock.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) have mean=21.4/week. All four past orders (P1:41, P2:60, P3:103, P4:97) show arrived=0 in their conclude messages, indicating actual lead time exceeds promised 4 periods or shipments lost. To protect service given prolonged non-arrival, I set an explicit longer lead time estimate so the OR backend inflates the reorder target appropriately. mu_hat and sigma_hat use population defaults based on all samples to reflect baseline demand (no evidence of demand regime shift).

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals confirmed: orders in Periods 1-4 (41,60,103,97 units) all reported arrived=0 by Period 4 conclude \u2014 suggests actual lead time >4 periods or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime has shifted sharply higher vs. the older sample set: recent demands (Periods 1-5) = [60,77,98,89,50], mean \u2248 74.8, clearly above historical low-Jan samples. Arrival history: Period 5 conclude shows 'arrived=41 (ordered P1, lead_time 4)', which confirms actual lead time = 4 for the observed arrival and explains prior missing arrivals (orders P2\u2013P4 still show arrived=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=364 \u2014 some in-transit may still be delayed/lost, so we keep the inferred lead time equal to observed average rather than trusting promised to be shorter. Decisions: set L="calculate" to lock in the observed lead time evidence; set mu_hat to recent_N using the last 5 demand observations to capture the new higher-demand regime; set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using current high demand while using recent variance to size safety stock, helping the OR backend balance service level and holding costs given confirmed longer lead-time behavior and possible lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-6) = [60,77,98,89,50,42], mean = 69.33, materially above the older sample mean (~22.4) indicating a sustained upward demand regime. Observed arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). On-hand=18 and in-transit=388 provide substantial pipeline; however demand regime shift requires raising forecast. I set L via calculate to capture observed lead times, mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the new demand regime (N=6 chosen as the available recent post-changepoint samples, >=3). These choices let the OR backend raise target base-stock to improve service given higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; using recent data also mitigates risks from earlier low-demand samples and addresses prior missing-arrival uncertainty by relying on concluded lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent mean (Periods 1-6) = 69.33 vs historical mean (earlier samples) \u224822.4 (+209%); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period5; Period2 order arrived Period6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1279.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: Periods 1-6 average demand \u224869.33 (much higher than historical ~22.4). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Current inventory: on-hand=51, in-transit=308. To capture the recent higher demand regime and observed LT=4, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant six recent demand samples. This biases orders toward meeting the new higher demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given past missing arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand regime is elevated vs historical: recent demands P1-P8 = [60,77,98,89,50,42,70,75], mean = 70.125, clearly above earlier sample mean (~22.4). On-hand=73, in-transit=288 (sufficient pipeline coverage). Lead time evidence: concluded arrivals show orders placed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8 \u2192 observed lead times = 4 periods consistently. I set L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher-demand regime (regime_length=8 \u2192 N=8). For volatility I also use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand Std. These parameters ensure the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the sigma estimate increases safety stock appropriately; choosing recent data avoids dilution by low historical pre-shift samples and leverages confirmed lead-time evidence when computing (1+L) coverage.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 1 (Periods 1\u20139 mean = 68.11 vs earlier historical mean \u224822.4). Concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20135 show lead_time = 4 consistently, so use observed lead-time. On-hand=125, in-transit=244 covers several periods but demand regime is higher so I use recent data to size replenishment. Choices: set L by calculating observed lead times to match confirmed L=4; set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime (use N equal to the recent regime length); set sigma_hat using recent_N (same N) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to restore service while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid excess safety stock given holding cost=$1/unit/period and profit=$19.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained upward demand regime (higher weekly demand since Period 1 in this run). On-hand =145, in-transit=201 (pipeline total=346) comfortably covers upcoming (1+L) periods but we still target the new higher demand regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new regime (Periods 5\u201310 demand pattern reflected), so base stock adapts to higher mean and volatility while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

On-hand=111, in-transit=178 \u2014 pipeline healthy. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the 4-period lead time. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime using the last 11 demand observations (regime length \u224811), so the OR engine will size base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Historical weekly samples show a sustained demand regime shift (elevated demand starting Period 1; recent mean \u224869.3 vs historical \u224821.4). On-hand=97, in-transit=196 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy but demand stays well above historical. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to lock to observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the entire new high-demand regime (stable across 12 periods) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean over the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=12 to capture current volatility rather than historical low variance. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet higher demand and avoid lost sales while keeping sigma aligned with recent variability to limit overstock/holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=76, in-transit=234. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5-P13). Demand regime elevated vs earlier historical samples (recent mean ~69.3 over Periods 1-6 vs ~22.4 earlier). To reflect confirmed lead time, set L by calculate (avg observed). To capture the recent higher demand and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (using the last 6 demand observations) so the OR backend targets base-stock appropriate to the new regime while capping orders per its cap rule. This balances service level (higher forecast) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has shifted up materially vs earlier historical samples (sustained high demands since Period 1 in this episode). On-hand=28, in-transit=288 \u2014 pipeline is large but demand remains elevated so we keep forecast based on recent demand. Lead time evidence in concluded history is consistently 4 periods; select lead-time estimate from observed data. Use recent_N=6 for demand mean/vol because the last 6 demand observations (Periods 9-14) represent the current high-demand regime and N=6 is within the recommended bounds. These choices yield a base_stock that reflects current elevated demand while the sigma from recent samples captures current volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent demand is much higher than historical sample (sustained regime starting Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=389 (some arriving but arrivals visible only in concl). Historical concl messages consistently show actual lead time = 4. I choose L by calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 6 demand observations to form (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to capture recent variability. These choices bias base-stock up to meet elevated demand while keeping sigma tied to recent variance so OR backend can size safety stock without overholding given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=344. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (arrivals from P1->P5 ... P12->P16). Recent demand is in a higher regime vs earlier baseline; last 6 concluded demands (P11-P16) = [57,91,81,89,83,98], recent mean \u2248 83.2. To reflect the sustained upward demand regime I set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 6 periods (captures current regime while bounded by available data). Sigma set using recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to reduce stockouts given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
2019-06-10 (Period 18). Current on-hand=31, in-transit=353. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods). Demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime since Period 1 (recent avg >> historical samples). I set L to 'calculate' to lock to the observed lead time average (evidence: many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across all available periods (regime_length=17). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=17 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the backend base-stock tied to the confirmed lead time and recent high-demand mean/variance, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-06-17. On-hand=58, in-transit=303. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=4). Demand has a sustained upward regime since Period 1 (recent mean over Periods 1-18 >> earlier historical mean). To capture the confirmed LT=4 and the recent high-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set demand estimates using recent_N=18 (covers the full recent regime). Use the same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices keep pipeline sizing aligned to observed LT and prioritize service during the higher-demand regime while allowing the OR backend cap to limit extreme over-ordering.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=72, in-transit=267 (no outstanding unexplained missing arrivals recently). Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use calculated average to lock in that signal. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent 19 observed weeks to capture the sustained, higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; apply recent_N for sigma_hat (N=19) to reflect current volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while using the calculated lead time to avoid underordering given the 4-period transit behavior.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been substantially higher than early-sample baseline (sustained regime since Periods 1\u20136). On-hand=3, in-transit=307 (pipeline large). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture confirmed actual lead time. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime using recent_N (N=6) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean over the review+lead horizon. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given strong recent demand while sigma_hat based on recent data informs safety stock; using observed L avoids underestimating pipeline timing and prevents ordering excess due to mistaken shorter lead-time assumptions.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has shifted up materially: last 6 realized weekly demands (Periods 16-21) = [98,67,68,87,119,122], recent mean = 93.5/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=320 units which is below (1+L)*recent_mean demand coverage (5*93.5\u2248467.5) so pipeline is insufficient. Lead-time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; demand shift appears sustained over many periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empirical 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=6 equals the recent regime length), so the OR backend will size base-stock to cover the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=410. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has been in a higher regime for many periods. I keep L as default (promised 4) so OR backend uses the known promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained elevated mean and higher volatility across the most recent periods; same recent_N N=20 for sigma to reflect current variability. This increases base stock to meet the higher demand while allowing the capped order to limit extreme over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand clearly elevated vs historical (sustained higher weekly demand since Period 1 in this trace); on-hand=0, in-transit=382 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set lead time inference to calculate (uses observed leads) and use recent_N for demand estimates over the most recent 12 demand periods (Periods 13-24) to reflect the new regime while smoothing older low-demand samples. Using recent_N for sigma_hat maintains volatility from the same recent window. These parameters make the OR backend target a base stock suited to the higher demand regime while respecting observed lead time and large pipeline to avoid overstocking.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has shifted materially higher vs the historical Jan samples; recent weekly demands (Periods 20\u201325) average \u2248114.7 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=395 (large pipeline). Past concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4. Use promised/default L to align with confirmed observations. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the new high-demand regime (captures last 6 weeks mean \u2248114.7). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices reduce stockouts under the new regime while avoiding overstating variability from old low-demand samples; large pipeline inventory will cap actual orders via the backend cap.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (much larger than pre-Period1 historical samples). On-hand=36, in-transit=416. Observed concluded lead times consistently 4 periods\u2014use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. To capture the persistent high-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent data: use recent_N with N=20 (captures latest 20 periods). Apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices align pipeline cover (1+L) with current demand and keep safety stock responsive to the elevated mean while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (recent mean ~69.3 vs historical ~22); on-hand=56, in-transit=430 so pipeline is ample. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (stable). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N over a long recent window (cap 20) for demand mean and volatility, and use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time=4. This balances service (capture elevated mean) vs holding cost (uses recent volatility to moderate safety stock).

Demand has been in a higher regime for many periods versus the early baseline, so I bias forecasts to recent data. Set L to default (promised = 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime using the last 20 demand observations; this raises base_stock to meet service while sigma from recent variability avoids excess safety stock. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand regime is elevated vs historical (recent average >> historical samples). Current on-hand=89 and in-transit=369 provide substantial pipeline cover. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. To reflect the confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime, set L using observed lead times and estimate demand/volatility from recent periods to capture the new regime while avoiding overweighting long-ago low demand samples. These parameters aim to keep base stock aligned with the higher recent mean while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent_N for demand and volatility reduces stockouts under the new regime and using calculated L ensures lead-time consistency with observed arrivals.

Historical concludes show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently; demand has shifted up (sustained higher weekly demand since Period 1 in this run). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the 4-period reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new, higher-demand regime while limiting to the most relevant recent samples (caps at 20). These choices align the base-stock calculation with the confirmed lead time and recent demand regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=233, in-transit=259. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders observed arriving exactly 4 periods after order). Demand has shifted to a higher regime vs the very early samples; recent weeks show substantially larger and more variable weekly demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms 4 and the backend expects promised LT. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across the last ~20 weeks while smoothing short-term noise. This raises base-stock to meet (1+L)-period demand under the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety stock reflects recent volatility, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) against holding cost and avoiding stockouts given substantial pipeline inventory.

Inventory is healthy but demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime vs earlier samples. Set L by calculating from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 20 demand observations to estimate demand mean and volatility over the (1+L) review+lead window).

Date 2019-09-30. Demand has been elevated vs the very early historical samples but lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current inventory: on-hand=296, in-transit=193. No recent lost shipments visible; pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand. To let the OR engine apply its statistical estimate based on all available demand history and the confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base_stock and caps using full-sample statistics. This balances service (using all data) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Current context: on-hand=322, in-transit=115. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift (higher mean) starting early in the series. No recent prolonged missing arrivals observed. To reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and base demand estimates on the most recent regime using the last 20 demand samples to capture current mean/volatility while limiting noise from older low-demand data. This balances service level (use recent higher mean to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by using a 20-sample window rather than full-history which would understate demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=336, in-transit=152. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1; no new sustained changepoint in the last periods. On-hand + in-transit (488) provides strong coverage vs typical weekly demand; to let OR backend use full history and promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the backend computes base_stock from all samples. This balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock from short-term noise.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=353, in-transit=108. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods). Demand has been in the higher regime for many periods (sustained elevated weekly demand vs the very early historical samples). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent demand regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent demand statistics to capture current mean/volatility. Using recent_N with N=20 balances responsiveness to the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing noise. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to higher realized demand and the capped order constraint reasonable so the OR backend balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent demand has been moderate compared with mid-year spikes; last 6 weekly demands = [43,52,33,27,32,42], mean\u224838.17. Current inventory: on-hand=303, in-transit=125 (pipeline=428) \u2014 ample cover. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use observed-average lead time. To reflect the recent lower demand regime and reduce holding cost while preserving service, set demand forecast based on the most recent 6 weeks (captures current trend) and use volatility estimated from the same window.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=351, in-transit=41. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time for many observed orders (periods with arrived messages indicate lead_time=4). Demand has been substantially higher than the very early 2019 sample window; recent weeks show persistently elevated weekly demand. To capture the current high-demand regime and recent variability, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the latest 20 demand samples. This balances service (by reflecting current high demand) against holding cost (by relying on recent variability rather than the full historical low-demand samples). No evidence of new missing shipments in the last several periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current on-hand=341, in-transit=133; pipeline + on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple Period X conclude messages), so use calculated lead time. No new sustained demand regime change in the last 3+ periods (recent weeks show lower/variable sales but not a persistent shift), so use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L)). This balances high service level (profit/holding => high critical ratio) with large on-hand inventory to avoid unnecessary ordering given holding cost exposure.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time; recent demand is well above the tiny early samples (sustained higher-volume regime). To reflect the confirmed lead time and focus forecasts on the recent high-demand regime, I use calculated lead time from observed concludes and recent_N demand estimates (last 20 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds a base-stock that balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=317, in-transit=92. Historical conclude messages consistently show a 4-period actual lead time over many observations (recent confirms), and demand has declined in recent weeks (last 6 demands: 42,36,10,18,33,14 -> avg\u224825.5). Profit=19, holding=1 gives very high service quantile (q\u22480.95) so backend will target high base stock; to avoid excessive holding given the recent low demand I use a short recent-window demand estimate. L set to calculated (use observed lead times). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility, keeping orders conservative relative to the backend's high service target. This balances service (high profit per unit) against holding cost and existing large on-hand stock to reduce overstock risk.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=397, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has fallen vs earlier year: last 7 concluded demands (Periods 38-44) = [42,36,10,18,33,14,12], mean=23.57 \u2014 clear recent downward regime vs earlier high-season weeks. Many concluded lead-time observations equal 4 periods; use calculated L. To keep service high (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) but reflect the recent soft demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (captures the recent low-demand regime and reduced volatility). This keeps base-stock tuned to current demand and avoids excess ordering given large on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed with W=4). On-hand=379, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock relative to recent weekly demand (single-digit to low-double-digit weeks), so no aggressive replenishment needed. Use L='calculate' to let backend confirm observed LT=4 from concluded messages. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat = 'default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service level (q=0.95 implied by profit/holding) against holding cost given current high on-hand and confirmed LT. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments are required now since lead time has been consistently observed as 4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Current on-hand=373, in-transit=45; recent demand has been low (periods 38-46 demands mostly 6-42, often ~20s), so inventory is ample. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods (use calculate to reflect observed average). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 conservative given stable demand recently and high on-hand; this avoids unnecessary ordering while preserving service with the OR base-stock calculation.
