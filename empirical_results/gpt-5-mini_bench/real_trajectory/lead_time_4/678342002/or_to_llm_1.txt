Rationale: with profit $19 >> holding $1, the cost of understock (lost sales) is high relative to holding; pipeline only 41 covers ~2 periods of typical demand (~21.4), so topping up to OR's recommendation (60) replenishes pipeline toward the OR base-stock while respecting its cap-like behavior.

Required coverage for L+1=5 periods \u2248 5\xd719 = 95 units. Current pipeline (106) already exceeds this 95 estimate, so additional ordering risks unnecessary holding cost.
