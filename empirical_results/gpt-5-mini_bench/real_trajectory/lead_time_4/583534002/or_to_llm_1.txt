  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed L=4 (carry-over). Inventory: on-hand=323, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201346): [1,2,11,5,3,2,4] \u2192 recent mean \u22484\u20135 units/week. With mean \u22485, current on-hand covers ~64 weeks, far exceeding (L+1)=5 periods. OR recommends 75 using promised L and historical data, but ordering would incur $1/unit/period holding cost while sales are very low. No evidence of imminent demand spike (date is 2019-12-30; post-holiday period typically low). Plan: override OR and place 0 units to avoid excessive holding costs and allow inventory to deplete. Monitor future demand for any sustained uptick before reordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Override OR's 75\u21920: on-hand 323 vs recent weekly demand ~4\u20135 means inventory covers many months; avoid high holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time and no sign of demand spike.",
