Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 221 units/week; no on-hand or in-transit inventory and promised lead time is 4 periods. With zero pipeline, we risk immediate stockouts; therefore use the promised lead time and the full-sample demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled volatility from all historical samples. This keeps orders large enough to cover the review+lead horizon while relying on the OR engine's service-level cap to temper order size given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (ordered P1) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Recent observed demand samples (weekly through 2019-02-04) show a modest downward drift but no sustained regime change (only one post-order period observed: demand=123). Given uncertainty about actual arrivals and no sustained changepoint, use promised lead time and let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples so pipeline coverage is based on full historical mean/variance. This balances service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost while we wait for more concluded arrival data to reassess lead time or demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=722 (matches orders placed in P1=369 and P2=353) and no concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred and shipments may still be in transit. Use promised lead time to avoid prematurely assuming losses. Set L=default to keep promised 4-period lead time. Use mu_hat=default to base demand forecast on the full historical sample (mean=221) scaled by (1+L)=5 => 1105 demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults provide the OR engine a stable base-stock target while accommodating the full observed variability and avoiding overreaction to missing concludes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1058 (sum of prior orders). Concluded history shows no arrivals yet but promised lead time is 4; per rules we cannot infer actual lead time from these concludes. No sustained changepoint in demand (historical five samples present). Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This keeps policy aligned with promised lead time while avoiding premature adjustments for potentially delayed or lost shipments.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=1087. Concluded history shows no arrivals yet for prior orders (arrived=0), but per rules we cannot confirm a lead-time change because promised L=4 would produce arrivals visible in later concludes; there is insufficient concluded evidence of lost shipments or a new lead-time. Demand history samples are limited and recent periods had no sales due to zero on-hand, so I will use default forecasting methods to let the OR engine apply its historical demand stats and promised lead time. Using defaults avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays while the in-transit bulk (1087) should cover upcoming periods if/when it arrives.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded arrivals show the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, so observed lead time = 4 (matches promised). Recent realized weekly demand from concluded periods 1-5 = [123,165,82,51,146], mean \u2248113.4, noticeably below the earlier historical sample mean \u2248221. To capture the new lower regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 5 periods (review+lead scaling handled by OR backend). For lead time I choose calculate so the backend uses observed lead-times (average of concluded lead times = 4). This keeps orders aligned with confirmed L=4 and recent lower demand, reducing excess inventory while maintaining service levels given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5); Demand regime shift: prior sample mean \u2248221 -> recent 5-period mean \u2248113.4 (\u221249%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has dropped vs. historical (recent 5-period mean \u2248113.4 vs. prior \u2248221) and two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Current availability: on-hand 425 + in-transit 365. Use L="calculate" to lock in observed lead time average (observed lead times = 4,4 \u2192 4). For demand, use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples reflecting the sustained lower regime and avoiding overweighting older high demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward lower base stock consistent with the new demand regime while respecting the confirmed lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=574, in-transit=29. Observed arrivals show orders placed P1,P2,P3 arrived after 4 periods \u2192 actual lead time confirmed =4. Demand has shifted down (recent 5-period mean \u2248113.4 vs prior \u2248221), so I use a recent-5 demand estimate for forecast and volatility to capture the new regime and avoid overstock while meeting service targets. L set to calculate to lock in observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce ordering compared to long-run mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has shifted downward and sustained (recent 5-period mean much lower than earlier samples), so use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the new regime. These settings (L=calculated, mu_hat recent 5, sigma_hat recent 5) reduce target base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding while preserving service for the lower recent demand level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted down vs. earlier history; most recent sustained regime spans ~5 periods. On-hand=454, in-transit=214 (no new concluded arrivals in Period 9), so we have healthy coverage but should size forecasts to the lower recent mean to avoid excess holding cost given $1 holding vs $4 profit. Lead time was confirmed as 4 in earlier concludes; we'll use promised/default lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the new lower regime, and match sigma to the same recent window so variability reflects recent behavior. This biases orders down vs long-run mean, reducing holding cost while preserving service under observed lower demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6, Period3\u2192P7, Period4\u2192P8). Recent demand has shifted down and stabilized: last 5 concluded demands = 146,151,187,90,59,44 (note some earlier high values) \u2014 previous carry-over identified a sustained drop; I therefore use recent 5-period demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. On-hand=410 and in-transit=276 provide substantial coverage; using recent_N (N=5) will reduce target base-stock to reflect the new lower regime while calculate for L embeds confirmed lead time. This balances service (covering L+1 periods of recent demand) against holding cost by reducing forecasted mean and volatility to recent behavior.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized well below historical pre-period mean (historical mean\u2248221; recent periods 5\u201311 mean=101 over 7 weeks). On-hand=376 + in-transit=276 \u2192 pipeline=652, which already covers multiple weeks at the recent lower demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals match promised). Therefore: keep L as default (use promised=4). For demand forecasting use recent regime (changepoint at Period 5) \u2014 use recent_N with N=7 (the 7-period recent regime length) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility. This biases orders down to match the sustained lower demand while the pipeline inventory provides near-term cover, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has fallen materially vs the historical sample (carry-over previously noted: recent 5-period mean \u2248113.4 vs prior \u2248221). Current on-hand=462, in-transit=157; no overdue arrivals beyond confirmed lead time of 4. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I use the promised/confirmed lead time and base demand estimates on the recent regime (capture lower recent mean & volatility). Therefore: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat from recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent lower mean demand regime; sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=522, in-transit=62. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals from Periods 1-9). Demand has shifted materially downward and the recent regime is sustained; use a short recent window to capture lower recent mean/volatility. Set L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent 5 demand observations and reduce target inventory given the lower demand, helping balance service level vs holding cost.

On-hand=566, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage but no confirmed incoming shipments. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concluded messages; I therefore use the promised/default lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized: last 5 concluded demands = [33,35,18,23,?] wait use samples shown \u2014 recent 5-period mean per carry-over \u2248113.4 total over single-period mean; on-hand=543, in-transit=0 so current inventory is ample vs. lower recent demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in earlier concludes and matches promised lead time, so keep promised L. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (evidence: Periods 11\u201315 show low single-period demands and carry-over note indicating prior mean \u2248221 -> recent 5-period mean \u2248113.4), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to downweight the historical high-demand weeks. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture reduced variability. These choices reduce ordering to avoid excess holding cost while keeping service by targeting the new regime; keeping L=default leverages the promised lead time the OR engine expects.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=528, in-transit=0. Historical and recent demand show a sustained downshift versus the original sample mean; pipeline empty so no incoming relief. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time and base demand forecast on the most recent observations. Set L=default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect current low-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock vs. using the older high mean and limits new receipts given large on-hand stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=508, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; keep promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen sharply and remained low for 5 periods (Periods 13-17: demands 35,18,23,15,20 -> mean=22.2). To match the current low-demand regime and limit holding cost while preserving service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (captures the new low mean/volatility). L uses default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: recent 5-period mean (Periods 13-17) = 22.2 units (per-period), (1+L)-scaled demand = 111 over review+lead; sustained for 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has settled into the low regime established Periods 13-17 (per-period mean 22.2, (1+L)-scaled = 111). On-hand=497, in-transit=0 and no arrivals expected soon. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; use promised/default lead time. To align OR base-stock with the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat explicitly to 111 (forecast over review+lead). Volatility from the last 5 demands yields std \u22487.73 per period \u2192 scaled sigma \u224817.3; supply this explicitly so the backend doesn't inflate safety stock from older high-demand history. This keeps service high while avoiding excess holding given large on-hand inventory.

On-hand=492, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock now, so avoid inflating long-run forecast from earlier high-demand periods. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor (1+L)-scaled demand to the most recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match the sustained lower demand while keeping service given current inventory.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained low-demand regime (~22.2 units/week recent mean), so (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*22.2 = 111. I set L to promised/default (4) to match confirmed lead time signal and use an explicit mu_hat = 111 to capture the recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale historical volatility over the (1+L) horizon.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=482, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed consistently 4 periods; use promised/default L to align OR engine. Recent demand has fallen sharply; last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 17-21) = [20,11,5,5,5], mean = 9.2 units/week, so (1+L)-scaled demand = 5*9.2 = 46. To avoid overstock while maintaining service with the new low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained lower mean and low volatility. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime drop confirmed (Periods 17-21): recent 5-period mean = 9.2 units/week, down from prior 22.2 (Periods 13-17) \u2192 (1+L)-scaled demand = 46 (sustained 5 periods).

Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime over the last 5 periods (Periods 18-22) consistent with previously recorded regime shifts; lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods. To align the OR backend with the current low-demand regime while using the known promised lead time, set L to default (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent 5-week demand behavior so the backend scales (1+L) accordingly). This reduces target base-stock and caps orders to avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory and low demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has settled at a low regime vs earlier periods: last 5 observed demands (Periods 19-23) = [5,5,5,15,11], mean=8.2/wk. On-hand=456, in-transit=0 so current coverage is very high versus demand; no arrivals expected (no in-transit). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclues and promised lead time=4, so use the promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat using recent 5-period demand to reflect the new low regime: (1+L)=5 scaled demand \u2248 5*8.2 \u2248 41. Use sigma estimated from the same recent 5 samples to capture current low variability. These parameters keep the backend base-stock small (protecting from holding cost) while the large on-hand stock covers near-term demand and potential lost shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=454, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6, etc.) and demand has been in a low regime for many periods (recent demands P20\u2013P24 = 5,5,15,11,2; 5-period mean=7.6). No new missing shipments. To keep service high while avoiding excess holding cost given very low recent demand, use promised lead time (default=4) and set demand forecast from the recent 5-period regime. Therefore set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=446, in-transit=0. Historical demands show a sustained low-demand regime (recent 5 periods demands = [5,15,11,2,8], mean=8.2 units/week). Lead time was previously confirmed at 4 periods and remains consistent with history. To align supply with the low recent demand while covering review+lead (1+L=5) periods, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets ~5*8.2=41 demand across review+lead and uses recent volatility for safety. This reduces excess holding cost given large on-hand stock (446) and zero in-transit while maintaining service level tuned to current regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand remains at the low regime established earlier (recent 5-week avg \u22488 units/week). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new evidence of change. To align the OR backend with the current low-demand regime, set L=default (promised 4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent 5-week mean across review+lead, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This reduces replenishment targeting to the observed low demand and limits excess holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has settled at a low regime (last 5 actual weekly demands = 11,2,8,4,13; mean \u22487.6) and there are no in-transit units; on-hand=429. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history (orders from Periods 1-4 arrived after 4 periods). To avoid overstock while matching the recently confirmed low-demand regime, set L using observed history (average observed lead time), and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low, stable regime. These parameters will reduce target base-stock and cap replenishment given high on-hand and low demand, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=424, in-transit=0; current demand regime has fallen to very low levels (recent weeks). Confirmed lead time previously observed as 4 \u2014 use promised/default to keep OR engine aligned. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest low-demand regime (Periods 24-28 avg demand = 6.4 units/week; (1+L)-scaled demand will reflect that). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. This keeps orders conservative given large on-hand stock and low demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime drop at Period 24: Periods 24-28 recent 5-period mean = 6.4 units/week, down from prior 9.2 (Periods 17-21); sustained 5 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been in a low regime (Periods 24-28 mean \u22486.4 units/week; Periods 25-29 continue low single-digit sales). On-hand=420, in-transit=0 \u2014 large on-hand relative to current demand; no arrivals expected from past orders. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; no evidence of change. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set lead time to default (promised=4). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (captures the most recent 5 weeks of very low sales), so the OR backend will target a much smaller (1+L)-scaled demand forecast and reduced safety stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Demand has been in a low regime for many periods: recent 5-week demand (P26-30) \u22486.8 units/week, consistent with prior recorded drops. Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). On-hand =412, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs. low weekly demand, so keep promised L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce forecast bias toward past higher means; this tightens base-stock and limits new receipts/holding cost given holding >> profit tradeoff.

On-hand = 404, in-transit = 0, so current inventory is ample vs. short-run demand; no shipments overdue. Confirmed past lead time = 4 but use promised/default lead time. To reduce excess holding cost while maintaining service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5-week regime (capture current low mean and volatility). Methods: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility and avoid inflating safety stock from older high-demand periods.

Demand has been in a low regime since Period 24; recent sample (Periods 24-32) shows sustained low demand (9 periods). I set L to default (promised lead time=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime length=9 \u2192 N=9) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 9 samples. This focuses the forecast on the confirmed low-demand regime to avoid overstock while preserving service, and keeps variability estimation consistent with recent data.

On-hand = 391, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to low demand, no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4; use promised/default L to keep backend alignment.

On-hand=386, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand already covers many weeks at current demand, so order rate should be conservative. Set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent low-stable regime (gives (1+L)-scaled \u03bc\u0302 reflecting latest mean and \u03c3\u0302 reflecting recent variability).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=377, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained low-demand regime across recent weeks (periods 32-36 demands = 7,6,5,5,4; mean=5.4/week). I keep L as default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and variability on the current low-demand regime so the OR backend will compute a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility that reflect recent low sales and avoid over-ordering given high on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 24 (weekly demands mostly 2\u201316, recent mean ~7\u20138). On-hand=361, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to low demand; no arrivals pending. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. To align the OR engine with the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent-N estimates for demand (capturing the post-changepoint regime) so the base-stock is computed from current, lower mean and variance, reducing excess holding. Chosen methods: L=default (use promised/confirmed 4); mu_hat & sigma_hat = recent_N with N=14 to cover the full recent low-demand regime (Periods 24\u201337) and produce stable (1+L)-scaled demand and volatility estimates.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=357, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 and there have been sustained low-demand regimes since Period 24. Pipeline is empty so no overdue arrivals to reconcile. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost I use the promised/confirmed lead time and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (most relevant for next (1+L) periods). I therefore set L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time, and use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime from Period 24 onward (15 periods of data available), which reduces forecasted (1+L)-scale demand and volatility and limits new orders given high on-hand stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=347, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4. Demand has been in a low regime since Periods ~13+, with most recent 5-week mean = 7.8 units/week (Periods 35-39). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime and prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the review+lead horizon.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=346, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods (no new evidence of change). Recent demand remains low (last 5 demands: 4,16,4,10,1 -> mean \u22487/week). To avoid excess holding while preserving service, keep promised lead time and base the (1+L)-scaled demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks. This reduces mu_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and tightens sigma_hat accordingly.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=344, in-transit=0. Recent 5 demands (Periods 37-41) = [16,4,10,1,2], mean \u22486.6 units/week \u2014 demand remains in the low regime observed since Periods 24+. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and low recent demand, use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current low regime; volatility also based on last 5 weeks. These parameters keep the OR base-stock small and prevent unnecessary replenishment while service level is maintained for the low demand environment.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=333, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Demand has been in the low regime sustained since Period 24\u201329 onward; I use a short recent window to capture the current low weekly demand. Set L to promised/default (4) to align with confirmed lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the latest 5 weeks of realized demand (captures recent low mean/variance and avoids overweighting older high-demand periods). This keeps the base-stock low to minimize holding cost while preserving service for current demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=328, in-transit=0; no pending arrivals or overdue confirms. Historical data show sustained low-demand regime; recent 5-week demand (Periods 39-43 = 10,1,2,11,5) mean = 5.8 units/week. Use promised lead time (default L=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime over the review+lead window (1+L=5). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and avoid overstating safety stock from older high-variance periods. This keeps orders small to avoid holding cost while preserving service for observed low demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=325, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 4 and sustained low-demand regime for many periods (recent 5 demands = 1,2,11,5,3 \u2192 avg=4.4 units/week). With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 review+lead weeks; use recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine scales safety stock to current volatility while avoiding excess replenishment given high on-hand inventory and holding cost > 0. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service.

Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods historically. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I use the promised/default lead time and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low mean and volatility. This keeps pipeline sizing tight (covers review+lead with recent demand) and reduces unnecessary ordering given high on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

To reflect confirmed lead time evidence and recent low-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks to capture current mean and volatility, which keeps orders moderate (avoid excess holding) while covering the review+lead horizon.
