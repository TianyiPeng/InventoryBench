Plan to order forecast*(L+1) = 115*5 = 575 units to cover expected demand over the pipeline horizon while avoiding stockouts. Holding cost is moderate ($1/unit/period) and profit per unit is $4, so prioritizing service (avoid lost sales) is appropriate given current zero inventory and steady demand.

Product: womens long-sleeved fitted top \u2014 demand can be seasonally sensitive but recent spike magnitude likely due to a local promotion or assortment change rather than calendar holiday. Demand analysis: Historical weekly demand Jan\u2013Feb was low-to-moderate (99,85,106,148,135). Two recent weeks show a large jump: Period 4 demand=509, Period 5 demand=595.
