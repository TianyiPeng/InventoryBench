Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed; promised lead time (4) remains supported by no contrary evidence. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u2248114.6 units/week; no sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level (via base-stock formula) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=158 (order placed P1 not yet arrived; promised L=4 so arrival during P5 is expected). Recent historical weekly demand mean = 114.6 units (samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). No sustained changepoint or confirmed lead-time shift (only one conclude showing arrived=0, which is consistent with promised lead time). Use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to compute base stock and caps; this balances service level against holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrival behavior.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent historical weekly demand mean = 114.6 (samples: 99,85,106,148,135). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (orders of 158 and 154 placed in P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so do not infer a lead-time change. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4 and compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample. This keeps the base-stock calibrated to cover (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding premature adjustments for potentially delayed but not yet confirmed lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed weekly demand samples (99,85,106,148,135) give mean\u2248114.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=462; no concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (expected arrivals occur later given promised lead time=4). No evidence of sustained lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while waiting for arrival confirmations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized demand: a single large spike in Period 4 (509) against prior weekly historical samples (~99\u2013148). On-hand=0, in-transit=557 which currently provides substantial coverage. No concluded arrivals have been observed yet so actual lead time cannot be confirmed. To avoid overreacting to one anomalous demand observation and given ample pipeline, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimates (use full-sample statistics). This balances service (via existing in-transit inventory) against holding cost and avoids inflating orders on a possibly transient spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $632.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows two very large demand observations (P4=509, P5=595) after earlier low weekly demand (~70-85). Only one concluded arrival indicates observed lead time=4 (order on P1 arrived on P5). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time average. For demand I choose EWMA_gamma to weight recent high demand more heavily (gamma=0.4) so mu_hat (which multiplies by 1+L) reacts to the spike while still smoothing older samples. Sigma uses default to reflect overall sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to increase target base stock to cover the apparent demand spike while keeping volatility estimation conservative given limited post-change data and avoiding a premature carry-over insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand samples (weeks in Feb) avg=114.6/wk; two concluded arrivals show orders placed on Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1428 \u2014 pipeline materially exceeds (1+L)\xd7mean demand. I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead time=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to historical weekly demand while letting the OR engine cap orders given the large pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived Period5; Period2\u2192arrived Period6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=64, in-transit=1278; historical weekly demand samples mean=114.6. Observed arrivals confirm lead time=4. Pipeline + on-hand is large vs. typical demand, so use confirmed lead time and population-based demand estimates: set L via observed average, and let mu_hat/sigma_hat use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR backend computes base-stock consistent with long-run stats while avoiding overreacting to recent noisy weeks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand shows a one-time large spike in Period 5 (595) then lower/variable demand (274, 86, 112). On-hand=47, in-transit=1183 \u2014 ample pipeline. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded history. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run sample stats, I choose to infer L from observations and use default demand/volatility aggregations (which use all samples). This avoids overreacting to the single extreme spike while the large pipeline covers near-term demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4. On-hand=340, in-transit=821 (healthy pipeline). Use promised/default lead time to keep OR aligned with supplier promise and observed reality. Historical sample mean = 114.6/week (2019\u201001 samples); with L=4 the default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean captures 5-week demand; default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These conservative defaults rely on full-sample statistics given stable demand and avoid overfitting to short-term noise while ensuring sufficient pipeline cover for the 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand samples (weekly) average ~114.6 units; no sustained regime shift observed. On-hand = 1102, in-transit = 48 \u2014 ample cover versus typical weekly demand, but pipeline visibility is delayed by 1 period. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to let OR compute (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures baseline demand over review+lead); sigma_hat=default so OR uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults rely on established lead time and historical demand to balance service level (protect against stockouts over the 5-period horizon) versus holding cost given currently high on-hand inventory.

No sustained demand regime shift detected; historical sample mean = 114.6/week so using default methods (promised L and full-sample stats) yields mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. Defaults keep the OR engine aligned with observed 4-period LT and balance service level vs holding cost given currently large on-hand position.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has cooled: last 5 demands = [112,81,47,30,48] (mean 63.6, std ~33.9). On-hand=1024, in-transit=48; inventory is ample vs recent demand so avoid aggressive ordering. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (use calculate). Set mu_hat using recent 5 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime and avoid inflating base stock from earlier spikes. Use sigma_hat based on the same recent 5 samples to reflect current volatility. This keeps target base stock modest and reduces holding cost while meeting near-term demand.

Inventory comfortably covers multiple weeks of demand so keep conservative/default forecasts: use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=994, in-transit=0; recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P9\u2192P13, P10\u2192P14). Given high on-hand and no pipeline, keep lead time as promised and use population-based demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock with full-sample mean/variance. Methods chosen: L='default' to use promised/confirmed 4; mu_hat='default' to use (1+L)*mean of all samples; sigma_hat='default' to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples.

Historical sample mean ~114.6/week (from provided samples) but recent realized demand is much lower; however this appears a temporary drawdown after large receipts. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods \u2014 use calculated lead-time to reflect confirmed observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=905, in-transit=27. Historical samples (5 weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~114.6/wk; recent realized arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods (Period 1\u21925, 2\u21926, 3\u21927, 4\u21928, 5\u21929, 6\u219210, 9\u219213, 10\u219214). Inventory is ample versus recent weekly demand (30\u201386). No sustained demand changepoint detected. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and global-sample demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to small recent noise while acknowledging confirmed L=4 and plentiful on-hand stock.

Historical sample mean (five weekly samples from Jan 2019) is the demand baseline; lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in prior conclude messages. I use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend uses L=4. I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to current large on-hand stock and occasional delayed arrivals.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set) so the OR engine leverages long-run sample stats to set base-stock while the cap limits order size to control exposure.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has been steady (~27\u201353/week) but historical seed mean from Jan samples =114.6. On-hand=819 + in-transit=35 = 854 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods of historical mean demand (5\xd7114.6=573). No new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes observed; prior insight confirmed lead time = 4. To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand seed, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set. This avoids overreacting to recent low variance while keeping sufficient cover for potential spikes and respecting holding cost tradeoff (profit=$4 vs holding=$1).

Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=832, in-transit=20. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~114.6/wk; recent periods show steady lower weekly demand (~30\u201350) after large early-season spikes but no sustained regime change. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concluded messages. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained demand shift, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies the (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and std. This balances service (use full-history mean across the review+lead window) against holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

On-hand=820, in-transit=12 -> pipeline=832 units which comfortably exceeds (L+1)-period demand based on historical samples. No evidence of lost shipments since Period 5\u201321 concludes all arrivals at lead time 4. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to let OR backend compute base stock and cap; this avoids overfitting to short recent low-demand noise while respecting confirmed LT=4.

On-hand=786 + in-transit=12 gives large coverage vs. expected demand; no overdue shipments currently. Use default demand/volatility methods so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (5\xd7114.6=573) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a conservative base-stock that balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overstating recent low demand given limited sustained regime change evidence.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has settled around the 20\u201340 unit range for many weeks (Periods 11\u201323: mostly 30s). Historical early-year samples (Jan) are not representative now. Lead time evidence from concluded messages (Periods 5\u201321) consistently shows 4 periods. I therefore set L by calculate to let backend confirm observed average (matches promised=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 10 demand observations), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent lower volatility \u2014 this keeps base_stock modest to avoid heavy holding cost given large on-hand inventory (760) and small in-transit (15).

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=750, in-transit=4 \u2014 ample inventory vs recent weekly demand (~114.6 mean from historical samples). Prior concluded history confirms lead time=4; no evidence of lost shipments now. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time and population-based demand stats: set L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This lets the backend compute a conservative base-stock balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=708, in-transit=16. Historical conclude messages (Period 5\u201324) confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence recorded at Period 7). Demand sample set (Jan\u2013Feb 2019 weekly samples) used as baseline; current inventory is high relative to recent weekly demands so avoid aggressive uplifts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=624, in-transit=64. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 23-27) = [27,21,42,37,51], recent mean=35.6. No sustained regime shift detected. Set L=default (use promised/confirmed 4). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to focus forecast on the most recent stable demand (~35.6/week) scaled by (1+L). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (cover next 5 periods of demand) while avoiding excess inventory given current high on-hand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=565, in-transit=105 => pipeline total 670 units; historical demand samples (weekly) from Jan\u2013Feb show mean\u2248114.6 units/week and std\u224823.3. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; I therefore use the promised/default lead time. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures baseline demand and variability). This keeps orders sized to cover the L+1 review horizon using full-sample stats, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given no recent sustained demand regime shift and confirmed lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand has been ~30\u201376 with on-hand=416 and in-transit=128 (total pipeline=544). Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) imply mean\u2248114.6/week; with promised L=4 the (L+1) horizon demand \u2248573, so current pipeline is slightly below expected coverage. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history, so keep promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level against holding cost given confirmed LT=4 and modest recent demand.

Recent demand has a noticeable spike at Period 33 (186) but the last 8 concluded demands (Periods 29-36 = 45,50,76,75,186,108,71,90) define the current regime (mean \u224887.6). To balance service level vs holding cost, I use a recent_N forecast (N=8) so the OR engine sizes base stock to cover the current short-term demand pattern while sigma uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=124, in-transit=370 \u2014 pipeline plus on-hand ample versus recent weekly demand (~71\u2013186). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time; I retain promised/default lead time to align with evidence. Demand has a recent uptick (Period 33 spike then elevated weeks), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (uses last 5 demand observations) and keep safety responsive to recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given large on-hand + in-transit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent concluded history consistently shows 4-period actual lead time; on-hand=203, in-transit=321 (total pipeline=524). Using promised lead time (default L) preserves consistency with observed arrivals. Demand historical samples (Jan\u2013Feb) give mean\u2248114.6/wk; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) yields a 5-week demand anchor that the OR backend expects. With L=default, pipeline+on-hand (~524) covers ~4\u20135 weeks of baseline demand (5\xd7114.6\u2248573 target), so parameters balance service level vs holding cost without overreacting to recent noise or sporadic late arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent weekly demand has varied (past 10 demands ~60\u2013119, occasional spikes to 186). On-hand=249 and in-transit=376 (total pipeline 625) provides ample coverage vs typical weekly demand; no evidence of lost shipments recently and concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend assumption aligned. For demand forecast use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility (std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine computes base_stock from full history\u2014this balances service level given healthy pipeline while avoiding explicit upward bias that would increase holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current inventory: on-hand=254, in-transit=364. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods, and historical weekly demand series appears stationary enough to use full-sample estimates. I choose default lead time (promised 4) to align with confirmed observations, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all demand samples. This balances service (use full-history mean with confirmed L) against holding cost given a healthy pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent on-hand=188, in-transit=419 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=607 units. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new evidence of change. Demand historical samples (seed) mean=114.6/week; no sustained recent regime shift that warrants changing the demand estimate. Profit=4, holding=1 implies high service target (q\u22480.8). I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and default historical demand/statistics so the OR backend builds a base-stock around the long-run sample mean scaled by (1+L). This keeps service high while avoiding ad hoc increases given ample pipeline inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand shows high variability including a large spike (Period 42 demand=231). On-hand=106 + in-transit=331 = 437 units which is below 5*(recent 5-week mean) \u2192 modest risk of understock if spike repeats. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods so use promised/default L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime and volatility (includes the recent spike) so the OR engine adjusts base-stock and cap to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals at 4). On-hand = 205, in-transit = 399 \u2014 pipeline is healthy but demand history is sparse (initial Jan samples). Use the observed lead time (calculate) so backend uses empirical lead-time average; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps parameters stable given no clear sustained demand regime change and balances service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=214, in-transit=419. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 in multiple windows; no sustained demand regime change detected. Use promised lead time and population demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1). Choosing default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat keeps policy anchored to full-sample estimates while pipeline (419) plus on-hand (214) provides cover for upcoming demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand shows a holiday-week spike (Period 42 demand=231) but the last 5 periods (P41\u2013P45) average ~94.4 units/week; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To balance service during the season while avoiding overreacting to a one-off Black Friday spike, I use the promised lead time (default) and recent_N demand estimates over the last 5 samples to capture current demand level. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the forecast responsive to the latest regime without overweighting a single outlier.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Current on-hand=231, in-transit=355. Profit=$4, holding=$1 => target service quantile q=0.8 (z\u22480.84). Recent demand shows a large spike at Period 42 (231) followed by lower values (62,45,68,31). This suggests a temporary spike rather than a sustained regime shift, so I use a recent_N=5 estimate to capture the most recent demand level while remaining responsive. Promised lead time is 4 and prior concluded messages consistently confirm 4, so keep L at default. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR engine compute a base stock that covers (1+L) periods of the latest demand pattern and reflects recent volatility to balance service and holding cost.
