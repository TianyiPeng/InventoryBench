Inventory need & demand: Recent history shows a single large demand spike in Period 4 (509) after three weeks of ~70\u201399. This is a large but not yet sustained regime change (only one period of high demand), so I will not assume a permanent higher mean. OR recommended 374 units based on historical mean and promised lead time; however, ordering additional now would likely create excessive holding cost because 573 units are inbound and will cover upcoming demand unless the incoming shipment is lost. Decision: place 0 units this period to avoid overstock and holding cost, relying on the in-transit 573 to arrive this period. If the Period 5 conclude shows the 573 arrived, reassess next period; if it fails to conclude (shipment lost or further delay), switch to immediate higher orders in subsequent periods.
