Forecast approach: because arrivals occur after a 4-period lead, we must cover (L+1)=5 upcoming selling periods. Use the recent regime as the best indicator of near-term demand given the sudden sustained jump. Recent 3-period average = 85 units/week \u2192 5-period demand \u2248 425 units. Required order to cover 5 periods = 425 \u2212 on-hand 127 = 298 units. OR baseline recommended 124 (uses long-run history and promised L); that severely underestimates the current upward regime. Trade-off: holding cost is nontrivial, but stockouts now would forgo $4 profit per unit and likely occur quickly given current sales rates. Action chosen: order 300 units (rounded from 298) to replenish pipeline and protect against further high demand over the 4-period lead. This restores coverage for ~5 periods under the elevated demand scenario while avoiding an odd-sized order.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). Inventory position: on-hand=55, in-transit=206 \u2192 total pipeline+on-hand=261. Demand outlook: recent weeks (Periods 42\u201346) show volatile but typical weekly demand ~24\u201337 except a one-week spike of 119; conservative recent average \u224836/week. Planning horizon: must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. Forecast 5-week demand \u2248 5 \xd7 36 = 180 units (even if we use spike-adjusted upper bound 5\xd750=250). Pipeline (261) comfortably covers 180\u2013250. Cost tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is material; excess inventory reduces objective. OR recommended 77 units but that would increase ending inventory and holding cost unnecessarily given ample pipeline. No evidence of lost shipments. Action: place 0 units this period to avoid extra holding cost while pipeline covers lead time demand. Follow-up: monitor arrivals in conclude messages to detect any lost shipments or sudden sustained demand shift.",
