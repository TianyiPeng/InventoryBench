Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples (5): [12,11,48,82,59] show recent elevated demand but only 5 points and no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=4. No sustained (\u22653 periods) changepoint or late-arrival signal to justify overriding defaults. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility scaling so the OR engine applies base-stock based on full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level for the recent spikes while avoiding overreacting to limited data and potential lost-shipment ambiguity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=93 (order from P1); Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet\u2014cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (12,11,48,82,59) give mean\u224842.4; no sustained demand regime change detected. Using default promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This preserves the OR engine's baseline forecast while accounting for the outstanding in-transit units and avoids overreacting to the single missing arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent realized customer demand in Periods 1-2 was high (67,71) but no stock was available; on-hand=0, in-transit=188 which equals orders placed (93+95). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change. Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019): mean=42.4 units. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time. For demand forecast use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures longer review+lead horizon). For uncertainty use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These settings are conservative given limited evidence of a sustained regime shift and ensure the OR engine targets the theoretical service level while accounting for pipeline inventory (188 in-transit).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=250, promised L=4. Recent realized demand in Periods 1-3 = [67,71,54], substantially above historical sample mean (42.4). No concluded arrivals yet for prior orders -> possible delays/lost shipments but not confirmed. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (no concluded evidence to change). For demand I detect a recent upward regime (3 consecutive high periods) so use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to respond quickly: mu_hat based on (1+L)*mean(last3)=5*64 to raise target base-stock and cover higher near-term demand; sigma_hat recent_N to reflect increased short-term volatility. This balances higher service level (avoiding stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than fully up-weighting older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent Periods 1-3 avg=64 vs historical sample avg=42.4 (+51%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=320, no concluded arrivals yet (orders from prior periods have not concluded). Historical sample mean=42.4 (weeks in data). Recent demand increased: Periods 2-4 demands = [71,54,68], recent avg = 64.33 (+52% vs historical). Because this is a sustained 3-period shift, I use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher regime. Lead time remains set to promised (default) since we have no concluded arrivals to reliably infer an actual lead time or confirm lost shipments. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while keeping L conservative given missing arrival confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent on-hand=39, in-transit=229 (pipeline=268). Historical sample mean=42.4 but a sustained upward regime was detected (Period 4 note). We observed a concluded arrival showing an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4). Therefore set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent regime: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent weekly demand (protect against stockouts over the (1+L) review+lead window). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to prioritize service (profit and lost-sales risk) while keeping safety based on recent variability to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has been above historical sample mean (recent regime detected around Periods 1-3 and sustained into later periods). On-hand=85, in-transit=160 (arrivals from Periods 3-4 orders still in pipeline); two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Use observed lead time for L. For demand forecast, emphasize the most recent regime: use last 3 demand samples to capture the elevated mean and recent variability. This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast while sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent visible demand (Periods 5-7) = [54,49,59], recent mean=54 which is ~+28% vs historical sample mean 42.4; confirmed higher-demand regime sustained for 3 periods. On-hand=88, in-transit=138 (pipeline looks healthy). Observed concluded lead times confirm actual L=4 (matches promised). To prioritize service given profit=holding cost, use a demand forecast based on the recent high-demand regime: set L=default (promised 4), mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new regime (N=3), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the new higher mean while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand regime confirmed at Period 4 (sustained higher demand); observed lead time consistently =4. On-hand=73, in-transit=112 (total pipeline=185) which currently covers several periods of demand but recent spike (regime) requires using recent data. Set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand, use recent_N with N=5 (regime length \u22485 periods) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead period. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture higher recent mean) while limiting excess ordering by using recent samples rather than full historical average.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 4 (sustained higher mean). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=18, in-transit=197 provides substantial pipeline but lead time=4 requires covering current + 4 future periods. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 4-9) to capture the post-changepoint regime: backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of these most relevant samples, providing a higher base stock aligned to elevated demand. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices increase service while avoiding over-commitment to older, lower-demand history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=255 (sufficient pipeline for multiple periods). Historical demand samples show a sustained upward shift (Periods 8-10 demands = 85,57,55; recent mean \u224865.7 vs historical mean 42.4, confirmed over 3 periods). Observed concluded lead times uniformly equal 4 periods. To protect service while limiting holding cost: set L to calculated-average observed lead time; set mu_hat using recent demand (capture the new higher regime) with N=3 and (1+L) multiplier applied by backend; set sigma_hat from recent volatility (N=3) to reflect current uncertainty. This balances higher target base-stock for the new demand regime while using recent variance to avoid overstocking.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=289. Historical samples and conclude history show actual lead time consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Recent demand since the detected changepoint (Period 4 onward) is higher than the original historical sample average; I treat the post-changepoint regime as the relevant forecast. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime from Period 4 through Period 11, length=8) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend builds base stock around the elevated recent demand while using observed lead time, and avoids underordering given substantial in-transit units and the 4-period replenishment delay.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=256. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived after 4 periods). Demand jumped at Period 4 and has remained elevated from Periods 5\u201312 (demands = [54,49,59,85,57,55,52,45], regime length=8). I set L=calculate to confirm actual lead time from observed data (avg observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the sustained uplift. This increases service (reducing stockouts) while the OR cap limits extreme ordering to control holding cost given profit=holding cost. Parameters chosen: L from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 demand samples to balance service level vs holding cost in the new regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 5\u201314): [54,49,59,85,57,55,52,45,37,45] shows a sustained higher regime vs historical sample (historical mean 42.4). On-hand=89, in-transit=114 (pipeline=203) provides strong coverage. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concl. I set L=default to use promised lead time=4. For demand I rely on the recent regime: use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to reflect the last 10 observed demands (captures the sustained higher mean) and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while the pipeline already provides cushion, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. On-hand=118, in-transit=106. Historical early-sample mean=42.4; Periods 1-3 showed a temporary higher regime (noted earlier) but recent demand (Periods 13-15 = 37,45,45) has reverted close to historical. Lead-time evidence (Periods 5-15) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Given confirmed LT=4, use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. Demand and volatility: no new sustained regime change (recent series back near historical mean), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps ordering aligned with confirmed lead time while avoiding overreaction to the earlier short spike; it balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent observed demand is higher than the original historical sample (historical mean=42.4; recent 12-period mean\u224854.25). On-hand=61, in-transit=135 (no overdue/lost shipments visible); pipeline + on-hand covers several periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5; this raises the base-stock to protect service while the OR engine balances holding cost via its z* formula.

Historical demand samples show a previously recorded regime shift (Period 4) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals consistently match L=4). Pipeline + on-hand currently provides substantial cover; no evidence of new sustained demand or lead-time change in last 3+ periods. To keep responsiveness to recent demand while reflecting the confirmed lead time, set L based on observed lead times and estimate demand using recent data (short horizon) to adapt to current weekly demand levels.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (noted previously); I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 4\u201318) to capture the current mean/variance for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This ensures base_stock reflects the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; using recent data balances service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=11, in-transit=121. Historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (observed multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Pipeline (121) plus on-hand (11) is large relative to recent demand but a recent regime shift to higher demand was previously detected (Period 4 note). To be responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while acknowledging confirmed LT=4, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 4). For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to capture the most recent demand level and avoid over-weighting older low samples. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline and high holding cost per unit.

Recent demand has risen vs historical; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21 = 37,21,38,89,110) average ~59/week, so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime and recent volatility. This (1+L)-period demand estimate will prompt replenishment because pipeline (141) < expected 5-period demand (~295), balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has risen (last 3 periods: 89,110,169) on top of an earlier sustained regime shift; actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=264 \u2014 likely short versus recent demand levels. I keep L as promised (confirmed 4) so the OR engine correctly accounts for 5-period coverage. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast and volatility responsive to the most recent demand regime (captures recent spike while smoothing short noise). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given limited pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. Recent demand has spiked in Periods 21-23 (110,169,107) after earlier data; on-hand=0, in-transit=382. Lead time evidence from concluded history repeatedly shows 4 periods, so use calculated L to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N (N=3) forecast to capture the new high-demand regime (three consecutive high-demand periods). Sigma uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine to raise base-stock for higher service during the sustained spike while keeping volatility and lead-time grounded in observed data; in-transit coverage (382) will be reconciled by the backend against the new base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg increased from 42.4 to 128.67 (+203%).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 21 (recent avg ~128.7/week vs historical ~42.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=569 (sizable pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in history. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I target the recent high regime using recent_N (N=4) to capture the sustained elevated demand from Periods 21-24. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the new higher demand while the large in-transit position prevents over-ordering.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=28, in-transit=519. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, etc.), so use promised/default L=4. Recent demand regime uplift at Period 21 is persistent; recent demands (P21\u2013P25) = [110,169,107,106,68], regime length=5. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this focuses ordering on the current high-demand regime while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand regime since Period 21 is elevated (periods 21-26 demands = 110,169,107,106,68,59; recent avg \u2248128.67 reported in carry-over). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=92, in-transit=409 covers multiple periods but demand spike persists so keep higher target. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (N=6 equals the regime length from Period 21\u201326). This increases forecasted review+lead demand and uses recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand (Periods 25-27 = 68,59,55) has returned to ~61 units after the large spike around Periods 21-24. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=200 and in-transit=261 is ample pipeline; to avoid excess holding cost I target the recent short-run demand level. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent regime and reduce forecast bias from the earlier spike. This keeps base-stock aligned with recent demand and lowers excess ordering while preserving service through existing pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 21 (higher demand vs earlier history) and confirmed consistent 4-period lead times in concluded messages. On-hand=330, in-transit=74 (healthy pipeline). I set L to default (promised lead time=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show actual L=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 (periods 21\u201328) to capture the post-changepoint regime (regime_length=8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of those recent samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility rather than mixing with older low-demand data. These choices focus the base-stock on the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating uncertainty from distant history, balancing service level versus holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=327, in-transit=81. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand since the Period-21 changepoint has been elevated vs early-sample mean but has softened in the last 9 periods (P21\u2013P29). To balance service vs holding cost I use promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent 9 periods to reflect the post-changepoint regime while not over-weighting older low-demand history.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows a demand regime change beginning Period 21 (sustained higher demand mid\u2010year) but demand has tapered since the peak; last 10 periods (P21\u2013P30) capture the post-change behavior (length=10). On-hand=301 + in-transit=94 = 395 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand under the chosen forecast, flagging no urgent replenishment. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed arrivals repeatedly at L=4). I set L=default to use the promised 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (captures the elevated but moderating demand). This reduces risk of overreacting to older low-demand samples while keeping safety for the higher recent variance, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given current large on-hand position.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=287, in-transit=94. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 consistently (orders placed P1->arrived P5 etc.). A demand regime shift starting around Period 21 raised mean demand substantially (carry-over notes: Period 21+ avg \u2248128.7). To avoid understocking I set L to promised (default=4) and base demand estimates on the recent high-demand regime. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 21\u201331) because the higher-demand regime spans 11 concluded periods; N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)=11. This raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the new regime while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 21 (sustained spike; carry-over noted). On-hand=256, in-transit=99; ample pipeline but demand volatility increased since Period 21. Lead time observed consistently =4 in concluded messages. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the repeatedly observed 4. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 21\u201332) to capture the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the recent higher mean while using recent volatility to balance service vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand is volatile with a sustained higher regime since Period 21 (recent avg ~128.7) but last few weeks mixed (P31-33: 29,31,142). On-hand=167 + in-transit=58 provides short-term coverage; no newly concluded arrivals overdue. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To capture the post-Period-21 higher-demand regime while weighting recent weeks, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N equal to the regime length (~13 periods since Period 21). This raises the (1+L) demand forecast and uses recent variability to set safety stock, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 => moderate z). L kept at default (promised) since concluded history confirms 4.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 21 (carry-over: avg \u2248128.7). On-hand=130, in-transit=184 (no overdue shipments). Promised lead time=4 and observed lead times have consistently been 4, so use default L to keep alignment with supplier promise. To capture the post-Period-21 high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime since Period 21; regime length \u224814 periods (Periods 21\u201334), so N=14.

On-hand=101, in-transit=243 \u2192 pipeline=344, which covers multiple weeks but with promised lead time=4 we must cover 5 periods of demand. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand history. This biases base-stock upward to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility to set safety stock appropriately.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been volatile but lower than the large spike seen around Period 21; observed lead times have consistently concluded at 4 periods. On-hand=59, in-transit=238 \u2014 ample pipeline. I keep L at the promised/default (observed =4 confirmed historically) and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 32\u201336: demands 31,142,63,44,47) so the backend bases base_stock on the short-run mean rather than the older large spike. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders conservative given heavy in-transit inventory, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has moderated versus the large mid-year spike; last 5 demand samples = [142,63,44,47,40], mean \u2248 67. On-hand=31, in-transit=256 \u2014 ample pipeline to cover near-term demand, no evidence of lost shipments (arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 in concluded history). I choose L=default (use promised lead time 4). To react to the recent drop from the earlier high-regime spike, I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and reduces orders versus using the full high historical average. For variability I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility from the same recent window. This balances service level (by honoring recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=137, in-transit=153 (pipeline=290). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent demand (Periods 33-38) = [142,63,44,47,40,46], recent mean\u224863.7 over 6 periods showing demand returned to mid-range after earlier spikes. Use calculated L to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time, and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-spike regime and recent volatility. This balances service (covering L+1 periods of elevated recent demand) while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Selected L via "calculate" because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (evidence in multiple Period conclude messages). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest lower-demand regime (reduces excess holding given high on-hand inventory) while the OR backend will compute base_stock and cap accordingly.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=159, in-transit=108 (total pipeline=267). Promised lead time=4 confirmed historically; no new lead-time evidence. Recent realized demand has been moderate (Periods 36-40 demands = 47,40,46,30,22) after earlier high-volatility regime. To avoid further inventory build while keeping service, I forecast using the most recent 5 periods: set L=default (promised=4), mu_hat based on recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This reduces ordering vs. full-sample averages given current high on-hand + in-transit and recent lower demand, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand regime is the higher regime detected earlier (shift around Period 21); inventory on-hand=171, in-transit=78 (ample coverage). Promised lead time is 4 and historically observed lead times have been 4; therefore use default lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set demand forecast using the most recent data (recent_N with N=20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the upshifted mean/volatility since the changepoint. This keeps service high while avoiding excessive extra stock given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=187, in-transit=86. Historical baseline mean=42.4 (samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019). Recent demand has moderated after prior spikes; last 10 concluded demands (Periods 33\u201342) average ~48.5. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures recent mean ~48.5 over (1+L) review+lead window). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago variability. These choices balance service (using recent higher mean than very old baseline) while avoiding overstating demand from older spikes, and keep holding cost in check given large on-hand inventory.

On-hand=207, in-transit=57 \u2014 ample coverage vs near-term demand but we must still replenish for lead-time coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm the observed average (matches promised=4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent lower-demand regime (keeps orders moderate to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=199, in-transit=57. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last 5 weeks (Period 40-44 demands = 22,18,33,9,8; recent mean \u224818) versus earlier elevated regimes. To avoid overstock during this sustained soft demand, set lead time by calculate (reflecting observed LT=4) and forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest low-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture reduced recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to align pipeline with current low demand while the calculated L preserves correct coverage for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23. On-hand=179, in-transit=57. Historic concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new lost-shipment signal. Recent demand (Periods 41-45 = 18,33,9,8,20) is substantially lower than earlier spikes and appears sustained over the last 5 periods. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) and use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts based on the most recent low-demand regime; this reduces excess holding while preserving service for near-term demand. With profit=holding, the backend's z*\u22480 (q=0.5) so using recent demand mean for the (1+L) review+lead window balances service vs holding costs.
