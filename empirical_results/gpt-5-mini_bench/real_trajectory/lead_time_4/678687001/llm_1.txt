======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday period) \u2014 likely elevated seasonal demand. Historical actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods repeatedly. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=350 (includes recent orders). When deciding now, those 350 units will only arrive in future periods (some during this period's arrivals but not visible until next conclude). Given large recent observed demand spikes (P45 demand=409, P46 demand=338) I forecast materially elevated demand over the next (L+1)=5 periods. To balance stockouts (very costly lost profit) vs modest holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit), I target covering a multi-period elevated demand scenario. I therefore order additional units to raise total pipeline to approximate expected 5-period demand. Action set to add 650 units now (combined with in-transit 350 gives ~1000 units in pipeline).",
