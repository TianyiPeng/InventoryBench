Because incoming pipeline (450) is already en route and additional units placed now will not help satisfy the near-term holiday surge, placing more order increases expected holding cost without preventing current lost sales. Risk trade-off: ordering now could protect later periods if the spike persists, but arrival is after the most acute observed weeks and we lack ETA granularity for in-transit split.
