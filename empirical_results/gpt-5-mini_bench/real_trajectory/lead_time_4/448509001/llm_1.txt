  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, modest holiday tail). Historical December demand shows elevated weeks but recent two weeks: P45=169, P46=123; expect ~130\u2013170 demand. Supply/lead time: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (existing carry-over evidence). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=750 units. Orders placed now would arrive in 4 periods and add to the large in-transit pipeline, creating substantial holding cost before full sell-through. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1/period; excess inventory is costly. With 750 units already in-transit sufficient to cover several future periods of demand (~4\u20136 weeks at current demand), the prudent choice is to avoid adding more pipeline and not risk extra holding costs. Action: place zero units.",
