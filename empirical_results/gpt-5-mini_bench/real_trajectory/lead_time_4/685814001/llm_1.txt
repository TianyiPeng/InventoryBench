{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar/product: Date 2019-02-11 (Northern Hemisphere late winter). Hoodie is seasonal winter apparel; demand can remain elevated through Feb but will decline toward spring. b) Demand analysis: Historical weekly samples show a sustained higher-demand regime in recent weeks: 2019-01-21=106, 2019-01-28=145, 2019-02-04=133. Recent 3-week average = 128 units/week. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet and no in-transit inventory, so assume supplier will take up to promised lead time until we observe conclude messages. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. To meet the rule (order + on-hand + in-transit should cover L+1 periods of demand, where L=4 => cover 5 periods) we need ~5 * 128 = 640 units. e) Final order logic: Because holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), avoid large overstocks beyond immediate coverage. However with zero inventory and an observed sustained demand increase, we must secure 5 periods of coverage to avoid stockouts given long lead time. Place order for 640 units.",

Period1 conclude shows ordered=640, arrived=0 \u2014 this is expected (arrivals occur later); cannot infer an actual lead time yet or loss.

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23: holiday season (pre-Christmas) => elevated demand (recent periods 42-45 showed very high weekly demand: 690,156,249,257). Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed many times); in-transit=810 likely = orders from P42 (560, arrives this period) + P43 (250, arrives next period). On-hand=0 but arrivals during Period 46 (the 560) will occur after decision and before demand resolution, so available to satisfy Period 46 demand. Given profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period, carrying extra inventory beyond near-term demand yields no expected net benefit (holding cost offsets profit). Pipeline (810) already provides substantial coverage for the immediate holiday weeks; ordering now would arrive at Period 50 (too late for current peak) and would likely create costly ending inventory. Therefore place no order this period.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (holiday season just passed). Recent demand regime: Periods 43-46 demands = [156,249,257,158], recent average ~=205/week. Lead time: confirmed 4 periods from history (arrivals consistently 4 periods after order). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=402, in-transit=250 => total available now = 652. Decision logic: with promised lead time L=4 we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand when ordering now. Forecast 5-period demand = 5 * 205 = 1,025 (rounded to 1,000 for simplicity). Shortfall = 1,025 - 652 = 373; using conservative forecast rounding to 200/week gives shortfall 348. To balance service vs high holding cost (profit=$1, holding=$1/period), order only the pipeline shortfall to meet expected demand without excess stock. Order placed now will arrive in Period 51 (visible in Period 52) and helps cover later weeks when earlier in-transit arrivals are consumed.",
