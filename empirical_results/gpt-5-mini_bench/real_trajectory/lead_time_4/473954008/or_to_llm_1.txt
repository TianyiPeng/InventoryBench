{
  "rationale": "Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). On-hand = 78, in-transit = 112 (pipeline total = 190). OR recommends 82 using base-stock with high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) which implies strong safety stock. Recent demand has been elevated vs long-run (carry-over noted +24%); calendar is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) which can support higher demand. Holding cost is low relative to profit, so erring on availability is appropriate. Given substantial pipeline but elevated expected demand and OR already accounting for high service level, I accept OR's capped recommendation and order 82 units to replenish pipeline while avoiding aggressive over-ordering given existing in-transit stock.",

OR applies its cap (\u224883) and recommends 82 units to avoid excessive single-period swings. Given the cap, confirmed lead time, current pipeline short of the target base-stock, and high profit/low holding cost justifying the high service level, I follow the OR recommendation (82) to increase pipeline toward the base stock while respecting the cap and avoiding over-ordering against uncertain ETAs. No new sustained demand/lead-time signals observed to warrant deviating from OR.",
