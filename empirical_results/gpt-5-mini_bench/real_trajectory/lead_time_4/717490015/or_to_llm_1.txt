Using that, in-transit=192 breaks down by order date: P5:39 (arrives during current Period 9), P6:11 (P10), P7:71 (P11), P8:71 (P12). So arrivals during this period = 39, leaving on-hand after arrival = 39 for demand resolution in Period 9. Demand analysis: historical empirical mean = 44 units/week (samples 2019-01), but recent realized demand over the last 4 concluded periods (P5-P8: 50,76,91,68) averages 71.25 \u2014 a sustained, material increase (\u22653 periods). OR used long-run mean and promised L; its recommendation (89) understates replenishment needed under the new higher regime. Inventory policy: aim to cover (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand under the new regime: 5 \xd7 71.25 = 356.25 units. Pipeline (in-transit + on-hand observed) = 192 (in-transit) + 0 on-hand = 192; since one of those in-transit (39) arrives this period it will help meet current demand, but pipeline for future coverage is still 192. Required order = 356.25 \u2212 192 = 164.25 \u2192 164 units (round down to avoid unnecessary holding given equal profit/holding). Adjustment vs OR: OR's 89 is too low vs needed 164 to cover the sustained higher demand over the lead-time horizon. Final action: order 164 units now to rebuild pipeline to roughly match 5-period demand under the observed higher regime.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5 and multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Inventory: on-hand=37, in-transit=15 => pipeline+on-hand=52. Demand analysis: historical sample mean = 44/week, but recent concluded demands (Periods 42\u201346 = 21,18,12,29,40) average 24/week sustained over 5 periods, indicating a meaningful downward shift vs historical (~-45%). Given profit = holding cost, overstock is costly; target should cover expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods using the recent regime. Expected 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd724 = 120 units. Required order = max(0, target_pipeline \u2212 current_pipeline) = 120 \u2212 52 = 68 units. This is lower than the OR's 117 because OR uses older higher mean and promised L; I reduce to reflect the sustained lower demand and maintained LT=4. Actionable risks: if demand reverts to the higher regime, stockouts could occur; but keeping inventory lean is preferable due to equal profit/holding cost.",
