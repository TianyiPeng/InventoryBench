Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period date 2019-02-11. History: 5 weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) with mean demand \u224845.8 and no recent changepoint or arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for review+lead. Use promised lead time and population-based estimates: L=default to ensure (1+L) coverage; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to capture historical volatility. No evidence of lost shipments or seasonal spike yet; defaults balance service level (high profit/low holding) with historical variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples = [42,56,47,42,42], mean=45.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=56 (order placed P1) but no concluded arrivals that indicate a lead-time change. Cannot confirm actual lead time or lost shipment yet. Use default (promised) lead time and demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance: default L (promised=4), default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all, default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all. This balances service level vs holding cost while we await concluded arrivals to detect any lead-time or regime shifts.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly demand mean = 45.8 (samples: 42,56,47,42,42). Promised lead time = 4. No concluded arrivals yet (P1,P2 orders show arrived=0 but are not yet late given L=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=120 which is below the (1+L)-period expected demand (~229 for 5 periods). Use default lead time so backend uses promised L=4 and default demand estimates ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to compute base stock; this balances observed steady historical demand with known promised lead time and lets the OR engine apply its cap to limit over-ordering given the existing pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (provided): [42,56,47,42,42], mean=45.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=190. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded as arrivals in their respective conclude messages; however promised lead time=4 is still the official promise and we lack confirmed shorter/longer actual lead-time evidence. To avoid overfitting to missing arrivals (which may be delayed or lost) I keep L at default (promised). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set so ordering will target the baseline demand forecast while the backend cap will limit order quantities given pipeline. This balances service level against holding cost given uncertainty about shipment fate.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not arrived in their conclude messages (Period1 ordered=56 arrived=0; Period2 ordered=64 arrived=0; Period3 ordered=70 arrived=0) \u2014 potential missing/lost shipments affecting pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent conclude messages show orders from Periods 1-4 (total in-transit=261) have not arrived \u2192 likely extended or lost lead times. To avoid over-ordering into a potentially stalled pipeline, I set L explicitly longer than promised to reflect delayed deliveries. I set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)\xd7mean(historical samples) to keep the demand forecast aligned with historical weekly mean (mean=45.8). sigma_hat left as default to let backend use overall sample volatility. These choices reduce the chance of placing additional large orders while the pipeline is questionable, balancing high profit-driven service level against holding cost risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has softened: last 3 realized weekly demands = 28, 34, 25 (avg ~29). On-hand=31 and in-transit=273, but several recent orders (P2-P4) have not concluded\u2014risk of lost/delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers observed lead time (we have a confirmed 4-period arrival from P1). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the lower recent regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target stock moderate given large in-transit pipeline while preserving high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5); Orders placed in Periods 2-4 remain missing (no conclude arrivals) \u2014 potential lost/delayed shipments affecting pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=65, in-transit=209. Historical demand samples (weeks in snapshot) mean=45.8; recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). Several orders from Periods 3-4 remain missing but confirmed LT=4 for arrived shipments, so use observed-average LT. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profitable margin ($19 vs $1). This approach is conservative given missing shipments but leverages confirmed LT and full sample history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7) and earlier suspected missing shipments have been partially resolved; P4 ordered=71 still shows no conclude but overall pipeline has recovered. Demand history mean = 45.8 units/week (samples: 42,56,47,42,42). On-hand=107 + in-transit=139 = 246 units, which covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 mean \u2248 229 units, so current coverage is adequate. I set L using observed lead-time average to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat uses dataset defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples, which balances service level against holding cost given strong pipeline coverage.

Recent conclude history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods for observed arrivals (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods) and no new sustained anomalies. Pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover near-term demand. Choose L='calculate' to use observed lead times (captures confirmed 4-period lead); mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples\u2014this is conservative but appropriate given high profit/low holding cost (q\u22480.95) and recent resolved delays.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=202, in-transit=36. Historical conclude messages show consistent observed lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2013P5 all arrived after 4 periods). Pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand but we maintain safety for variability. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4. I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable baseline given no recent sustained demand regime change and confirmed lead time. This balances service (using observed L) against holding cost given high current on-hand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Current on-hand=162, in-transit=60; recent demand history (Periods 1\u201311) shows a downward/stable regime (~16\u201330 units) versus early spikes. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived after 4), so set L to calculate (backend will average observed lead times = 4). To reflect the recent lower/stable demand pattern, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 11 demand samples (use most recent regime data rather than older sparse Jan samples). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=11) so demand volatility matches the recent 11-period behavior. These choices keep base-stock tied to current demand levels while using confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid under- or over-ordering given delayed/lost shipment history.

LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show consistent observed lead_time=4 (Period1 arrived in P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, etc.), and recent arrivals have resolved earlier missing shipments. No sustained demand regime shift detected from recent demand history. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed data; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand mean/volatility from all samples ((1+L) multiplier applied there). This balances service (use observed L=4) vs holding cost while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has settled lower (~20-35/wk) vs. earlier Jan samples (~42-56). Concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (observed P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so use calculated average lead time. Use recent_N (last 12 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (N=12 covers Periods 2\u201313 demands), which lets the backend set a smaller (1+L)-period forecast and tighter safety stock to reduce holding cost while maintaining service. This also guards against earlier missing shipments by relying on concluded lead-time evidence rather than transient in-transit counts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=112, in-transit=78. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14). No new sustained demand regime shift detected; recent weekly demand has been stable (~19\u201347 range). I set L to calculate to confirm use of observed lead times (backend will average observed leads, expected ~=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor mu_hat to the latest 5 periods of demand (captures any near-term trend and avoids overweighting older Jan samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (use observed L and recent demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent conclude history shows consistent observed lead time = 4 periods for multiple orders (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=80, in-transit=68. Pipeline + on-hand (148) comfortably covers several weeks of demand given historical weekly mean (~45.8). Some earlier late/missing arrivals were observed but later concluded, so no persistent loss signal remains. Use promised lead time to match observed confirmed lead time and use default aggregation for demand and volatility so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (higher profit per unit) against low holding cost ($1) while relying on full-sample stability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=47, in-transit=124 (pipeline sizable). Profit/holding ratio implies service-level push but pipeline already covers several periods. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample estimates scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so backend computes base stock and cap from full history. This balances maintaining availability given the confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding excessive explicit overrides given a healthy in-transit position.

Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead_time=4 for arrived orders (P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), and some earlier intermittent missing arrivals were later resolved; overall evidence supports using the observed average lead time. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (which matches the promised 4). Demand/volatility will use historical aggregation: mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) with current healthy pipeline and avoids overfitting to short-term variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 Period 19. On-hand=63, in-transit=147. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (multiple confirmations P5,P6,P7,P8,P12,P13,P14,P15,P16,P17), so I set L to the calculated average lead time. Demand series (18 samples, mean \u224832.6 units/week) shows no sustained recent regime shift, so I use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine grounded in full-sample estimates while acknowledging confirmed lead time; it balances service level (through full-sample mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost by letting the backend compute the z* tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=37, in-transit=166. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P arrivals with W=4), so infer lead time from observations. Demand recently averages higher than the early Jan samples and shows variability; use recent data to capture current regime. Choose L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most recent 8 demand observations, balancing responsiveness to recent demand while smoothing noise. This preserves service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock from recent demand while avoiding excessive holding from older low-demand samples.

Recent demand has declined versus early-year samples (recent weeks demand ~22\u201338 vs earlier ~42\u201368); I detect a sustained lower-demand regime over the last ~10 periods and choose recent_N with N=10 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the recent regime. This balances service (capture current lower mean) vs holding cost (avoid overstock from older higher means).

Recent demand spikes in Periods 22-23 (75, 87) are notable but not yet a 3+ period sustained regime shift, so do not adjust demand estimate yet. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (evidence strongly points to 4).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=189. Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead times = 4 periods for orders that arrived (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), and some earlier missing arrivals resolved as late but confirmed L=4. Given confirmed actual lead time = 4 and available long-run demand samples (mean ~45.8 over provided history), use a lead-time estimate derived from observed data and default demand/volatility computations so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling and its cap logic. This balances service (use full (1+L) forecast window) versus holding cost given relatively low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). Using defaults lets the backend compute base_stock and the capped order while accounting for observed L.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent demand has spiked sharply since Period 22 (75,87,67,103) while on-hand is 0 and in-transit = 256. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time for delivered orders, though some shipments were missing/delayed earlier. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (which recent conclues support \u22484). Demand forecast uses recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (weights latest 6 demand observations rather than older low-demand data). Sigma uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the backend cap prevents excessive ordering given pipeline; using recent samples helps avoid understocking amid confirmed demand surge and accounts for observed shipment irregularities by relying on concluded lead-time evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg demand before P22 (Periods18-21) \u224824; recent avg (P22-P25) = 83 (+59, +246%) \u2014 sustained high-demand regime (4 periods of elevated demand).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22: Periods 22-25 demands = [75,87,67,103], recent avg \u2248 83 (much higher than earlier ~24). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods for many concluded orders. On-hand=0, in-transit=316 (pipeline large). To capture the elevated demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times (reflects confirmed 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 22-25) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the new high-demand regime, improving service during this spike while the large pipeline limits immediate new orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 22: Periods 22-27 demands = [75,87,67,103,129,109] (avg \u2248 95). On-hand=0, in-transit=394 (pipeline large but several past orders experienced 4-period lead time; recent concludes confirm lead_time=4). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead time average (confirmed =4). I use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 6 periods since changepoint at P22 and regime length=6). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility so the OR backend increases base stock to protect service while cap limits over-ordering given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders arriving 4 periods after order); several earlier periods had delayed/missing shipments but most recent concludes align with 4. Demand shifted up starting Period 22 and has remained high (demands P22-P28: 75,87,67,103,129,109,113), so we remain in the elevated-demand regime. I set L=default (use promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 8 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility). This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity (459) will be reconciled by the OR engine's pipeline accounting.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand shifted up at Period 22 and has remained elevated through Periods 22-29 (sustained higher weekly demand). To reflect confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' so backend infers average observed LT (\u22484). To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 22-29) so the forecast and volatility reflect the sustained elevated demand while keeping pipeline sizing sensitive to recent variance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (recent 9-period mean \u224895 units/week). On-hand=25, in-transit=438 \u2014 pipeline looks well-stocked versus elevated demand, but lead-time history repeatedly confirms a 4-period arrival pattern. I therefore keep L at promised lead time (default=4). To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 (uses the last 9 demand samples P22\u2013P30). Volatility should reflect the same recent window, so sigma_hat recent_N N=9. These choices focus the OR backend on the elevated demand pattern while respecting confirmed lead time and abundant pipeline to balance service and holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 22 (multiple periods of elevated weekly demand through Period 31). On-hand = 112, in-transit = 383 \u2192 pipeline = 495, which must be compared to expected (1+L)-period demand. Lead time historically observed = 4 periods (consistent across many concluded arrivals), so use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (covers the last 10 demand observations since the regime shift). This biases the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. These choices balance service level (avoid stockouts in high regime) against holding cost by relying on recent regime statistics rather than long-run low-demand averages.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand shifted to a sustained higher regime starting Period 22 (elevated weekly demand P22\u2013P33). On-hand=128 + in-transit=245 gives strong pipeline, but elevated demand persists so I bias the forecast toward the recent high-demand regime. Set L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 22\u201333, regime length 12).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (elevated weekly demand, e.g., many weeks 75-154). On-hand =132 and in-transit=325 provides substantial pipeline, but past missing shipments occurred early; since Period 5 onward arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 22\u219234 (13 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean and volatility rather than long-ago low-demand data. This biases base-stock upward to protect service during the sustained high regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability to avoid stockouts.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods consistently. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift upward starting Period 22 (higher mean and variance). On-hand=131 and in-transit=347 (strong pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time = 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (captures the sustained high-demand regime since P22 while smoothing short spikes). Sigma uses recent_N N=14 to reflect elevated volatility in the new regime. This keeps the base-stock forecast responsive to the higher demand regime while the large pipeline reduces immediate refill pressure and avoids unnecessary extra orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (many orders: observed arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 22 (elevated demand). On-hand=64, in-transit=384 (pipeline large). Choose L='calculate' to reflect observed average lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=15 (use the recent high-demand regime from Period22\u201336, regime length=15) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the current high-demand samples. This biases ordering toward meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline caps actual ordering via the OR engine.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=443. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with W=4), and there was a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22 (elevated demand since P22). Reconcile: large pipeline (443) will cover several upcoming periods but some recent orders historically arrived with 4-period lag. I set L via calculation to reflect observed lead times. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=16, covering Periods 22\u201337) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; same recent_N (N=16) for sigma to capture current volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the elevated regime while relying on observed lead time and existing in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (elevated weekly demand through Period 38). Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=447 \u2014 substantial pipeline. I use L=default (promised=4) because many concluded arrivals match 4-period lead time. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility since Period 22; N=17 (Periods 22\u201338 available, N=min(regime_length,20)=17) so the OR engine will size base-stock to the recent high-demand level. This balances service (avoid stockouts in current high-demand regime) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 22 (recent periods show large weekly demand; historical concludes P22\u2013P39 support higher mean). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Pipeline is large (in-transit=501) while on-hand=0; some earlier late/missing shipments resolved and recent arrivals align with L=4. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=18 (covering the sustained high-demand regime from P22 onward) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 18 demand samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=18 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize meeting high recent demand while letting the OR backend size safety stock and cap orders appropriately given the large pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 22 (recent weekly demands large; many P22+ periods with demand >> earlier baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=564 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover upcoming demand, but we must set forecasts to the elevated regime. Observed conclude messages consistently show 4-period arrivals (many orders with lead_time=4), so use calculated lead time. Set L via calculate (average observed lead times = 4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N over the post-changepoint high-demand regime (N=19, Periods 22\u201340) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and variability. These parameters align the OR base-stock toward high service (q=profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95) while relying on actual pipeline to avoid unnecessary immediate ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (recent averages much larger than pre-P22); historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=534 \u2014 pipeline is large but delayed visibility continues (1-period conclude lag). To focus the OR engine on the recent high-demand regime, set L to promised (default=4) and estimate demand/volatility from the most recent regime using recent_N (N=20, regime length P22\u2013P41 \u224820). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated demand and higher variability, producing a higher base-stock while the cap still limits over-ordering against pipeline and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=507. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders repeatedly arrived after 4 periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 22 with much higher weekly demand through recent periods. To capture confirmed lead time use calculated average of observed lead times. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (regime length \u226520, cap 20) so the backend bases base_stock on the most recent high-demand samples and their volatility. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given substantial pipeline (507 units).

To capture the sustained higher demand and recent volatility, set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N=20 for mu_hat to base forecast on the last 20 demand observations (captures the high-demand regime), and recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than long-run low-demand history.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 22 (confirmed in carry-over) and actual lead time consistently observed as 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=155, in-transit=452 (healthy pipeline). To reflect the elevated demand regime I use recent data for demand forecasts (capture recent 20 periods since regime is long and capped at 20). Keep lead time as default (promised 4) because concluded messages consistently confirm L=4 and missing shipments are not currently observed. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the elevated mean and volatility, improving service while containing holding costs given current ample pipeline.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=152, in-transit=452. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (many confirms), and demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 22. To reflect confirmed lead time stability, use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained elevated demand and recent volatility I use recent_N on demand and sigma with N=20 (captures most recent regime while capping N). This increases forecasted review+lead demand and variability so the OR backend raises base-stock to avoid stockouts given large pipeline and confirmed L=4; holding cost is low relative to profit so higher safety stock is acceptable. No new evidence of lost shipments in recent concluded history.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. History shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (many concluded arrivals = 4). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 22 (P22-P46 elevated demand); to reflect the recent high-demand regime I use recent data. On-hand = 227 and in-transit = 418 (healthy pipeline) so parameters should target recent higher mean while not over-inflating variability. Chosen methods: L=default to use the promised/known 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples) so the OR backend builds base stock from current elevated mean and measured recent volatility.
