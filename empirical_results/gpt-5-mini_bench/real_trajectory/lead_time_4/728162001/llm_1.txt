  "rationale": "Product = womens basic V-neck tee (low seasonality but holiday shopping can shift). Calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (end-of-year). Historical lead time: confirmed 4 periods from concluded arrivals. Recent demand (Periods 43-46): 25, 14, 21, 24 \u2014 average ~21 units/week, a sustained low regime over 4 periods. Prior 4-week average (P39-42) = (51+79+64+134)/4 = 82, so demand dropped sharply (~-74%). With promised/confirmed lead time = 4, we must cover (L+1)=5 future periods. Forecast 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd721 = 105 units (conservative). Current on-hand + in-transit = 232 + 284 = 516 units, well above required pipeline. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory severely penalizes reward. No evidence of incoming lost orders. Therefore place no order this period to avoid further holding cost and to allow inventory burn-down toward normal levels.",
