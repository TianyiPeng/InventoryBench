Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47) falls immediately after large Dec holiday spike (Periods 42\u201346). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals consistently 4 periods after order). On-hand=0, in-transit=1706 units (these are already committed and will arrive per observed 4-period lead time). Recent demand has shown a sustained high/holiday regime (P42\u2013P46 average demand \u2248343/week, though some sales were constrained by stockouts), so plan should ensure coverage for the next (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. The in-transit 1706 units alone cover roughly 4.9 weeks at ~350/wk, so the pipeline already provides near-term cover. Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit), placing an additional order now risks excessive holding cost if demand softens post-holiday. No evidence yet of a sustained new regime beyond the documented holiday spike. Therefore do not place a new order this period.",
