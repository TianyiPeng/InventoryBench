Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable weekly sales ~148\xb19; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default L=4). No clear demand regime change\u2014use default aggregate forecast: mu_hat default => (1+L)*mean(all samples). sigma_hat default to reflect historical variability. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock anchored to historical mean while avoiding premature adjustments for lead-time or demand shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demands: [148,133,150,139,160], mean=146. On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (order placed Period 1). No concluded arrivals beyond Period 1 conclude, so actual lead time not yet observable\u2014use promised lead time. I choose L=default to keep backend using promised 4-period lead time. Demand forecast uses mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd7146 = 730) to capture the full review+lead demand. Volatility uses sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples \u2248 20.8) to let the OR engine size safety stock per its formulas. This balances service (covering 5 periods of typical demand) while relying on the backend cap to limit excessive orders given holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 146 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (orders from P1+P2). No arrived confirmations in concluded messages (P1 & P2 orders both arrived=0), so no reliable evidence to change promised lead time. I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand stats so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples. This keeps the OR base-stock tied to historical mean while the in-transit volume covers upcoming periods; default methods avoid overreacting to two periods of delayed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent weekly sample mean = 146 units (samples: 148,133,150,139,160). On-hand=0, in-transit=493 (orders placed P1-P3: 164+162+167) \u2014 these orders have not yet exceeded the promised lead time (4), so treat them as still in-transit. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend plans for L=4. Use default demand methods so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures 5-period demand horizon) and sigma_hat default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (covering current+lead period demand) against holding cost while awaiting the in-transit arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) average ~146 units/week; no concluded arrivals yet for any orders (periods 1-4 shows arrived=0) but per rules we cannot confirm a lead-time change until an arrival conclude appears. On-hand=0, in-transit=673 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand, so use conservative defaults tied to promised lead time to let OR backend apply its capped base-stock calculation. Chosen L/default and demand stats default let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding cost given current large in-transit inventory and risk of lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has risen versus earlier historical samples: Periods 1-5 demands = [144,165,184,188,170], recent mean \u2248170.2/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=657. Promised L=4; using observed lead-time data (Period1 order arrived in Period5) I set L by calculation (observed avg). With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; (1+L)*recent mean \u2248851 units, so current pipeline (657) is short of target \u2014 parameters use recent 5-period demand to capture this upward regime and increase base-stock. I choose recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises the base-stock toward recent demand while sigma reflects recent variability. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost by anchoring to the recent higher-demand regime and letting the OR cap limit order size if needed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5; observed lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): on-hand=0, in-transit=694. Concluded history shows two observed lead times = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6) so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. Pipeline (694) covers several weeks of demand but arrives with 1-period observation delay. I choose L='calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time. Demand samples (historical weekly mean=146) show no strong 3+ period sustained regime shift beyond normal variance, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std), which balances service level vs holding cost given stated profit/holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has risen sharply: last three weekly demands = 170, 204, 257 (Periods 5-7). On-hand=0, in-transit=687 (covers multiple weeks). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods. I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (3 most recent samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility (recent_N N=3). This biases target base-stock up to meet the clear upward shift while sigma based on recent variability keeps safety stock responsive; using recent samples avoids diluting the spike with older low-demand data and prevents overstocking given holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 5 (demands: P5=170, P6=204, P7=257, P8=394) indicating a sustained upward regime over the last 4 periods. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=4 (confirmed in history). On-hand=0, in-transit=790 covers future demand but recent higher demand motivates using recent observations. Set L by calculate to lock in observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the new high-demand regime and increased volatility so the OR backend raises base stock and safety stock accordingly while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded demand (Periods 5-9) shows a clear upward regime vs. historical Jan samples: last 5 demands = [170,204,257,394,206], mean \u2248246.2 over those 5 periods (vs. historical mean 146). On-hand=0, in-transit=1061 which slightly under-covers a (1+L)-period demand at the new regime. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use observed lead time. Choose L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time history. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime; likewise use recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma captures increased uncertainty so OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-10 = 170,204,257,394,206,233) shows a sustained upward regime vs. older samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=1199 \u2014 pipeline large but demand elevated so keep forecast responsive. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 (use calculate to reflect observed lead times). Set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 demand observations) to capture the new high-demand regime and higher variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run averages.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has risen materially vs. historical Jan samples: last 5 observed demands = [206,233,306,?] (recent high volatility and higher mean); on-hand=0, in-transit=1209 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals are delayed by lead time). Lead time: observed concluded arrivals consistently show 4 periods => use calculate to let backend confirm average (effectively 4). Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect increased volatility. This biases base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand while pipeline volume will limit new order size via cap.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=58, in-transit=1253. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6 ...). Recent demand (Periods 5-12) is materially higher and more volatile than the early Jan samples (values: 170,204,257,394,206,233,306,225). I set L via 'calculate' to rely on observed lead-time data. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility over the last 8 concluded-demand periods, so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture increased variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) against holding cost by sizing safety stock to recent variability rather than older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Demand history shows high variability but recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods. Current on-hand=417, in-transit=904 \u2192 pipeline=1,321 units (sufficient vs. short forecast but demand volatile). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (supported by concluded arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a balanced base-stock that leverages long-run demand estimates while the capped ordering will limit over-ordering given current large pipeline. This approach is conservative given confirmed LT=4 and substantial in-transit inventory; it avoids aggressive up-weighting from short recent spikes.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=685 and in-transit=567 (total pipeline=1252) which comfortably covers expected demand over (L+1) periods. Historical weekly samples (148,133,150,139,160) suggest mean weekly demand ~146. I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time and historical demand while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and demand has moderated recently (latest weekly demands: 170,204,257,394,206,233,306,225,60,69,48). Current on-hand=807, in-transit=397 -> ample coverage. Use promised/default lead time to keep alignment with observed confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given large on-hand position and confirmed L=4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical weekly mean demand \u2248146 (samples 2019-01), promised lead time = 4 confirmed repeatedly in history (P1\u2192P5 etc.). Current availability: on-hand 1086 + in-transit 70 = 1156 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7mean demand (~5\xd7146=730). No evidence of recent demand regime change or lost shipments. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise and prevents unnecessary ordering given high on-hand inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Demand context: historical sample mean=146 units/week (samples: 148,133,150,139,160). On-hand=1123, in-transit=0; inventory is ample vs. typical weekly demand. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, matching promised lead time. I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time. With ample on-hand stock, use default demand/statistics so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples ((1+4)\xd7mean) to avoid overfitting short-term noise and let the capped order cap limit ordering. This balances service (low stockouts given high on-hand) against holding cost by not increasing forecast aggressively.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=1092, in-transit=0; recent concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. There are no overdue shipments. Given very high on-hand relative to recent weekly demand (most recent demands ~30\u201360), I use the promised lead time (default) which matches observed. To avoid additional holding cost while inventory is ample, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes target stock from historical demand; this biases toward not ordering now and lets the capped policy constrain any order size.

Historical weekly samples (seed) mean=146 over provided samples. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (matches confirmed observations). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a base-stock anchored to historical demand while the capped order cap prevents extreme replenishment. Given high on-hand, this avoids aggressive new orders and balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 4 historically. No recent arrivals => no evidence of new lead-time or demand regime shift. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine anchored to long-run demand and the confirmed promised lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Recent demand has been low-moderate (last reported weekly demands: 72,72,36,31,33,48,48,69,60,225,394,... history shows higher earlier but last ~10 weeks average << early spikes). On-hand = 912, in-transit = 0 (no shipments pending); promised lead time = 4 and past conclues confirm LT=4. To avoid unnecessary holding cost given large on-hand, keep lead time at promised (default). Forecast demand using a recent window to reflect the lower recent regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (captures the most recent demand regime). Use default sigma_hat (backend's sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so variability is estimated from full history. These choices keep target service high (profit>holding) while preventing over-ordering into already-large on-hand stock.

Demand has fallen from earlier spikes to a stable lower weekly level (~30-80 in recent weeks). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend confirm average observed lead time (matches confirmed 4). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to recent low-variance weeks given substantial on-hand inventory. This keeps orders conservative while pipeline + on-hand cover upcoming demand and mitigates holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has declined from early high winter/spring peaks to steady summer weekly demand (recent weeks: 64,31,40,72,72,36,31,48,48,69,60,225,... then settled). On-hand=777, in-transit=38; no confirmed arrivals in last several conclude messages beyond expected lead-time windows, but historical conclues firmly show actual lead time = 4. To keep policy consistent with promised lead time and the OR backend's default forecasting (which uses all samples), I select default lead time and default demand mean/variance so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std from full history. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost by letting the OR backend use profit/holding to set z*.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=734, in-transit=88. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods; recent orders after Period 17 show arrivals paused but no sustained lead-time change. Use promised/confirmed lead time and long-run demand statistics from available samples (Jan 2019 weekly samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. I select default calculations for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to rely on the full-sample mean/variance and the confirmed L=4; this avoids overreacting to short recent arrival gaps or small orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the historical winter mean (~150s) to ~30\u201372 units/week. Current on-hand=704 and in-transit=115 (total pipeline 819) \u2014 ample cover vs recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 in multiple periods; no sustained new lead-time or demand regime that meets the 3+ period threshold for a changepoint. I therefore use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine retains its assumed L=4 and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history (default) so the base-stock calculation blends winter samples with recent lower demand rather than overreacting to short summer dip. This balances service level with holding costs given large on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has settled to low weekly rates (past months mostly 30\u201372 units/week). On-hand=682, in-transit=103 (sufficient coverage for multiple weeks); recent arrivals match promised L=4 (no sustained delays). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (backed by multiple concluded arrivals at 4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std\u2014this yields a base-stock that balances the high profit-to-holding ratio (q=0.8) while avoiding excess additional inventory given current large on-hand stock and stable demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=625, in-transit=125; recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods historically. Demand samples (seed) show weekly mean ~146. Profit/holding ratio yields moderate service target; maintain promised lead time and use full-sample demand estimates so OR backend produces a stable base-stock that balances service vs holding given ample on-hand stock. No strong recent demand regime shift detected; some past shipments arrived on-time (LT=4) and recent small arrivals consistent with normal flow.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Current on-hand=612, in-transit=133. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent recent arrivals: P23\u2192P27, P24\u2192P28, P25\u2192P29). Demand has two regimes: early high-demand (Periods 1\u201311) then lower steady weekly demand from ~Period 12 onward (~30\u201375/week). To focus the forecast on the recent lower regime and given confirmed lead time, I use the promised lead time and recent demand statistics (last 10 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean/volatility, limiting excess replenishment while maintaining service given substantial on-hand plus pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=567, in-transit=106 (total pipeline=673). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent weekly demand has been ~30\u201375 units; current inventory+pipeline comfortably covers multiple weeks. To remain robust to demand variability while respecting the promised lead time, I keep L at the promised setting and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history (default methods). This uses (1+L) scaling and full-sample mean/std so the backend balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given current high inventory and confirmed 4-period lead time. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed\u2014concluded history shows timely arrivals.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = promised 4 periods. On-hand=526, in-transit=207 (pipeline substantial vs. recent weekly demand ~60s-70s). To balance service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) use default lead time and default demand estimates: L=promised (4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages full-sample stability (no sustained demand regime shift) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while keeping inventory coverage for (L+1) periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand regime is much lower than early-2019 (sustained ~30\u201372 units/week since Period 13). On-hand 531 + in-transit 218 = 749 units, which is ample relative to recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use the promised/default L. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the lower post-changepoint regime: the last 20 concluded weekly demands (Periods 13\u201332) have mean \u224850.65 \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248253 units; sample std \u224816 \u2192 implying pipeline volatility \u2248sqrt(5)*16\u224835.8. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns the base-stock with the new lower-demand regime and reduced volatility, avoiding excess holding while maintaining service for the confirmed lead time.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent realized demand (~last months) is much lower (~30\u201375/wk) than early-sample mean (~150). On-hand=519 + in-transit=160 provides substantial cover. Promised lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in concluded history, so use default L to keep backend aligned. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower recent-demand regime (stable for many weeks) so base-stock reflects current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service.

Use default promised lead time to align with supplier contract. Demand history (seed samples mean=146 week) + (1+L)=5 implies default mu_hat keeps replenishment covering the review+lead horizon; default sigma_hat uses full-sample volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current on-hand depletion risk) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in a lower regime (~20\u201375/week) since mid-June (Periods ~18\u201335) versus much higher early-season spikes. On-hand=590 + in-transit=136 => pipeline_inventory=726, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand if L=4. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm 4-period actual lead time; no evidence to deviate. To keep service while avoiding excess hold cost I select promised lead time (default) and set demand forecasts using the recent low-demand regime (recent_N) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility rather than early-season spikes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent on-hand is high (622) with 91 in-transit; profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit suggests moderate service-level target. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; demand baseline from provided samples averages ~146/week. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this keeps ordering conservative while the pipeline and high on-hand mitigate stockout risk and limit holding cost growth.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand = 601, in-transit = 100; no sustained demand regime shift detected (demand has been moderate and stable since summer). Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its base-stock calculation using full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service high given large on-hand inventory while letting the backend trade off service vs. holding cost via its q-derived z*. Recent small arrivals of prior orders are expected given L=4; no evidence of lost shipments requiring explicit L adjustment.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (recent demands ~25,19,13,21,44), while on-hand=557 and in-transit=110 (total pipeline=667) is large versus recent demand. Historical concludes confirm lead time=4 periods. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the clear downward regime in the last 5 weeks and avoid over-ordering from older high-demand weeks; mu_hat uses recent_N so backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low variability and keep safety stock tight given high on-hand. These settings reduce holding cost while preserving service given large current inventory and short recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-443.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier) and stable weekly demand around the historical sample mean (~146 units/week). Current on-hand 607 + in-transit 19 = 626 units, which covers multiple weeks of demand; no recent large lost-shipment pattern. I choose default lead time to use the promised/confirmed L=4. For demand forecast I choose default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to anchor to historical baseline (robust given no sustained regime change). For uncertainty I choose default sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute volatility from full-sample std; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to recent low-variance periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=549, in-transit=87. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 (confirmed earlier); recent demand has been lower than early-season peaks (recent demands ~19,13,21,44,41,58 etc.). To prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while keeping service, use promised lead time (default). Fit demand to the recent regime using the last 8 observed demand periods to reflect the lower current mean/volatility, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8. This reduces target base-stock vs. using all-sample mean and limits extra inventory holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=485, in-transit=78. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand history (weekly samples from early 2019) shows no recent sustained regime shift; no lost-shipment pattern beyond isolated zeros. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed supply behavior and avoid overfitting, I use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves service level while limiting holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

No sustained demand regime change detected recently. Use default lead time to match promised/confirmed L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures 5-period demand aggregation). Pipeline (188) is well below the 5-period expected demand (~730), so the OR engine will order to replenish toward the computed base stock while balancing profit=$4 vs holding=$1 via its service-level mapping.

Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has been relatively stable since mid-2019 with no sustained regime shift. Using default lead time keeps promised L=4 (matches observed evidence). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full history to set the base-stock while the backend's cap limits over-ordering. This choice balances service (profit/holding ratio favors higher fill) against holding cost and accounts for the large in-transit pipeline already present.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent weeks show elevated December demand (Periods 42\u201344: large spikes, including a 542 demand in P42 and 297 in P43) but current on-hand=0 and in-transit=705 units. Historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4 periods. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages the full sample history to smooth recent spikes while the backend\u2019s capped policy limits excessive orders, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=790 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are invisible until conclude. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; keep promised/default L to align with backend. Use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to upweight recent high-demand weeks while retaining longer-run history. Use default sigma_hat to reflect overall observed volatility. This balances higher service level for the seasonal spike against holding costs given large in-transit volume.

Promised lead time remains 4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4. To capture the recent uptick I use recent_N with N=4 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized to cover the elevated short-term demand while L uses the promised lead time.
