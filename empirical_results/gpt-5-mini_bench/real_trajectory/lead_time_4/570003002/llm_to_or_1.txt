Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean ~47.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods; no evidence to adjust. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, ensuring safety stock covers review+lead period while avoiding unsupported explicit adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=63 (ordered P1) but arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude -> cannot yet infer actual lead time (only one period delayed). Use default promised lead time to avoid overfitting. Demand history (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) has mean 47.6 units/week; using default mu_hat yields (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults balance service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand mean ~47.6 (samples: 35,53,41,57,52). No concluded arrivals yet (P1 and P2 orders still show arrived=0), insufficient evidence to change promised lead time or record lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1) and limited evidence of regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=237. Historical sample mean ~47.6/week (samples provided). Orders from Periods 1-3 have not concluded but this is within expected window given promised L=4 (no concluded arrivals yet), so no confirmed lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility (use full-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation while keeping parameters conservative against unconfirmed shipment loss.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~47.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=308 (matches sum of orders placed P1\u2013P4). Four consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in P1\u2013P4, indicating shipments overdue or lost; however no concluded arrivals exist to reliably infer a different lead time. To remain consistent with promised lead time while letting the OR engine use full historical demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps ordering responsive to established demand while the carry-over insight records the missing-shipment signal for future decisions.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders totaling 308 units (ordered P1:63, P2:73, P3:101, P4:71) have not concluded by end of P4 (arrived=0 for P1\u2013P4); possible lost/very-delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5) is considerably higher (~71,109,74,77,59) than the older historical samples (mean 47.6). On-hand=4, in-transit=254, but several recent orders (P2,P3,P4) remain unconcluded suggesting delayed/lost shipments; P1 concluded with lead_time=4. I set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (P1 gives evidence of L=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, higher-demand regime (uses Periods 1-5 demand samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7current average demand rather than the older baseline. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices aim to raise the target base stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping variance estimates current; using recent data also helps the OR engine compensate for missing/delayed shipments by increasing safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived in Period 5 conclude); Missing shipments totaling 308 units remain unconcluded (orders from P2:73, P3:101, P4:71, plus later orders) indicating delayed or lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand (P1-P6: 71,109,74,77,59,70) is substantially above the historical sample mean (47.6), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. There are significant outstanding in-transit units (290) from earlier orders; however, some prior orders remain missing so treat lead time as confirmed from observed arrivals. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time data (avg=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the higher recent demand regime (use last 6 periods), so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while the capped order limits control over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand has been ~59\u2013109/week (most recent 5 periods: P3\u2013P7 = 74,77,59,70,76) with no sustained large shift; observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=32, in-transit=276 which plus on-hand covers several weeks; I choose L='calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time average (4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest regime and reduce influence of older Jan samples. Sigma also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These params keep base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding overreaction to older data and help the OR backend balance service-level (profit=holding) under observed LT.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Historical weekly mean demand = 47.6 units (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1..P4 arrived with 4-period lag). Current on-hand=31 + in-transit=253 = 284 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 mean \u2248238 units, so we can target default statistical forecasts. I choose L="calculate" to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 4). I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this yields a base-stock consistent with observed demand and confirmed lead time while avoiding overreaction to recent shipment noise.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 for observed arrivals (orders on P1\u2013P5 arrived with W=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=286 \u2014 pipeline exists but several earlier shipments were delayed before concluding; no new sustained demand regime detected (historical weekly samples 35,53,41,57,52 show stable baseline). To be conservative and let the OR engine use observed lead-time data, set L via 'calculate' (average observed). Use default demand/volatility aggregations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u21d2 z*=0). This avoids overreacting to transient missing shipments while accounting for confirmed lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10). On-hand=75, in-transit=216; several prior orders were delayed but recent arrivals confirm lead time. Demand has been running higher than the small 2019-Jan seed samples; last 6 concluded demands (P5\u2013P10) average \u224862 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost with profit=holding, target coverage = (1+L) periods of this recent mean. Therefore set L by calculating observed lead times, use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend builds an appropriate base stock while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=74, in-transit=149. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.); several earlier orders were delayed but recent history shows 4-period arrivals. Demand sample mean (historic samples provided) = 47.6 units/week. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) capturing baseline weekly demand scaled over the review+lead window; sigma_hat default uses all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps provisioning aligned with confirmed LT while letting the OR backend compute safety stock and the capped order to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=33, in-transit=198. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Recent realized weekly demand (most recent 5 concluded demands P8\u2013P12) = [72,62,34,88,89], mean\u224869. I choose L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=4 from concluded history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher/volatile demand regime; this yields (1+L)-scaled mean and std over the latest 5 demands so the OR backend raises base_stock to cover the L+1 review window while reflecting recent variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and recent demand spike) against holding cost by adapting to the recent regime rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and no new loss pattern; on-hand=29, in-transit=263 \u2192 total pipeline=292. Historical sample mean = 47.6 units/week (from provided samples). With promised/observed L=4, review+lead horizon = 5 periods; pipeline (292) comfortably covers 5\xd7mean (\u2248238). I choose default methods so the OR backend uses the canonical (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std calculations, letting the backend compute base_stock and cap while reflecting the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-05-20 (P15). On-hand=7, in-transit=256; historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5 etc.) and many prior missing shipments were later resolved, so use observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 7\u201314) shows a new, higher regime vs the Jan samples; I use the most recent 8 weeks to capture current demand level and volatility. Setting L via calculate confirms 4; mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=8) makes the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the higher recent mean while keeping variability for safety against stockouts, balancing profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): demand history shows stable weekly demand with many concluded orders all exhibiting 4-period lead time. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=303 (large pipeline). Past missing shipments from early periods largely resolved but pipeline remains sizable. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (avg observed = 4). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost and the confirmed 4-period lead time and large existing pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=14, in-transit=228. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Several earlier delayed shipments were later observed to arrive; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shift in the last 3+ periods. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so target service quantile is 0.5; I use default all-sample demand statistics and the promised lead time to let the OR backend compute base_stock and caps consistently with its priors.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has stabilized over the last 5 concluded weeks (P13\u2013P17) with demands [46,61,72,83,60], mean=64.4. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concluded messages; continue using promised lead time. On-hand=61 and in-transit=208 provide coverage; use a recent-5 demand estimate to capture the current regime while keeping safety buffer via OR backend. Chosen methods: L=default to rely on promised 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand samples to reflect the recent regime and variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=23, in-transit=229. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2013P14 arrived after 4 periods), and some earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent history confirms lead_time=4. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so critical ratio q=0.5; using default demand estimates keeps the OR backend's base-stock conservative. I select L='calculate' to lock in the empirically observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=302. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 16-20) = [83,60,70,82,76], mean=74.2; this is materially higher than the early-sample mean, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L=default to use promised 4, mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher mean over the review+lead horizon, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend raise target base-stock to cover the 5-period demand spike while using recent volatility for safety stock, balancing service level and holding cost given the high on-going in-transit volume.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and earlier missing shipments are reflected in in-transit; demand history shows no clear recent regime shift. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this keeps parameters grounded in long-run demand while letting the capped policy limit order size given pipeline inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=73, in-transit=190. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and recurring demand around prior weeks (no recent structural shift detected). Several earlier missing shipments were noted but subsequent conclues confirm lead_time=4 and continuing arrivals, so do not adjust L. Use default calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock and cap, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

There are prior missing shipments noted earlier but recent history shows regular 4-period arrivals, so use the promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and confirmed lead time.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Historical weekly mean demand from provided samples = 47.6 units; recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4. Current on-hand=84 + in-transit=197 = 281 units, which covers (1+L)=5 periods demand expectation (5\xd747.6\u2248238), so no urgent corrective replenishment needed. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; use default demand sizing (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to keep the OR engine's statistical inputs stable given limited sample history; use default volatility scaling. These settings balance service (covering 5 weeks of expected demand) against holding cost by avoiding excessive explicit upward adjustments given sufficient pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=98, in-transit=188. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods). No new sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demand levels are similar to historical samples. To keep the OR baseline and let the engine use full-sample statistics, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so base-stock is computed from all samples and promised L=4. This balances service (use full-history mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; earlier missing shipments were observed but recent history shows regular 4-period arrivals. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed pattern. Select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock covering current review+lead horizon while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excessive inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has averaged above the early-sample mean; current on-hand=135, in-transit=143. Previous carry-over shows confirmed lead time=4 and earlier missing/delayed shipments; however arrivals since P5 follow 4-period cadence so use promised/default lead time. Profit and holding cost are equal (low critical ratio), so use default demand estimates to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample history. This balances service vs holding given ample pipeline and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuation or previously lost shipments.

Several earlier missing shipments were resolved and subsequent arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed lead time and historical demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/Std.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=45, in-transit=165 (pipeline total=210) \u2014 sufficient short-term coverage. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time. There are prior missing shipments noted but recent history (P5 onward) consistently shows 4-period arrivals. Use promised/default lead time to align with observed pattern and let OR backend compute demand forecast from full sample set. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat balance service level vs holding cost by using all historical demand statistics scaled for (1+L).

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=39, in-transit=210. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. No new sustained demand regime change detected. Use L=calculate to lock in observed lead time average (reflects confirmed 4-period LT). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this keeps target base-stock near historical mean (profit=holding implies q\u22480.5) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while covering the review+lead demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=38, in-transit=218. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (observed across many concluded messages). There were earlier missing/delayed shipments but subsequent concludes confirm steady 4-period arrivals. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead time average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) periods from all samples (conservative given stable weekly demand). This balances service (capture mean demand over review+lead) while keeping holding pressure moderate (profit=holding, q=0.5).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current on-hand=47, in-transit=210. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; earlier missing shipments were partially resolved and later arrivals also follow 4-period lag. To remain consistent with observed lead-time evidence and conserve pipeline coverage, use promised/default lead time. Demand forecasting will use default (all-sample) estimators for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding ($1:$1) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise or isolated missing shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows consistent realized lead times of 4 periods and stable weekly demand around prior sample mean; current inventory: on-hand=36, in-transit=153 (pipeline adequate vs expected demand). I choose default lead time to keep promised L=4, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the policy aligned with historical demand and the promised lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise or transient shipment anomalies.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=47, in-transit=197. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed). Several earlier missing shipments were observed but subsequent concludes show lead_time=4 for arriving orders; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change detected. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand moment estimates so the OR backend applies long-run sample mean/variance across available history; this is conservative given no sustained demand shift and keeps pipeline provisioning by the backend while avoiding manual over-adjustment for transient missing shipments.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Demand recent history shows stable weekly demand with observed lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in conclude messages). On-hand=47, in-transit=207. Given profit=holding, target service quantile q=0.5 so no extra safety stock beyond demand forecast is needed. Use lead-time estimate from observed history and let OR backend compute base_stock and cap from historical demand statistics. This balances service vs holding given balanced profit/holding costs and confirmed LT behavior.

Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=33, in-transit=208. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time; missing-shipment issues documented earlier persist but recent concludes confirm LT=4. Use calculated L (average of observed lead times = 4) to reflect confirmed actual LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (stable demand history). This balances service (meet demand over review+lead) while avoiding extra explicit increases given no sustained demand regime shift.
