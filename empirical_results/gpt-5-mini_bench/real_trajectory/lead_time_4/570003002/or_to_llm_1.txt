  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (carry-over). Inventory status: on-hand=0, in-transit=196 (will arrive >0 in future periods per concluded history). Demand assessment: recent sustained high-demand regime recorded in carry-over (Periods 11\u201315 avg \u224871.2 vs historical avg \u224847.6, +49.5%). With L=4 we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent regime mean \u224871 \u2192 5-period demand \u2248355 units. Pipeline covers 196, so uncapped order_needed \u2248 355\u2212196 = 159 units. Risk adjustment: profit=holding cost, so overstock is costly; OR recommended 89 but used promised-history assumptions and caps. I compromise between OR and full replenishment given holding cost and some pipeline already inbound: order 120 units (raises pipeline+order to 316, closer to 355 while limiting immediate holding exposure). This order accounts for confirmed lead time and sustained higher demand while tempering downside from equal holding/profit tradeoff.",
