Historical weekly demand samples (126,120,128,113,161) give empirical mean 129.6; OR computed a capped base-stock order of 161 using promised L=4, the OR cap, and the profit/holding inputs. Lead-time inference: No concluded 'arrived' messages exist, so I cannot infer any actual lead-time different from promised 4 or detect lost shipments. Demand outlook: recent sample includes a high value (161) but overall mean is ~130; no sustained regime shift (only 5 samples, no multi-period trend). Risk tradeoff: With L=4 and zero pipeline, aggressively ordering to match the 5-period aggregate (\u2248648) would expose us to heavy holding costs and arrivals too late to cover current periods; small orders now will not help satisfy near-term demand until they arrive in Period 5. Decision vs OR: Given no evidence to contradict OR assumptions (lead time, demand regime), and the OR already applied a safety buffer and cap, I'll follow the OR recommendation to avoid unnecessary inventory buildup.

Promised lead time L=4 (no concluded arrivals yet \u2192 cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment). OR recommended 186 units.

Decision logic: I will not chase a single high demand observation (186) as evidence of a sustained regime shift (needs 3+ periods). Promised lead time stands and in-transit stock (161) partly covers future demand; excessive ordering now increases holding cost. Therefore I reduce OR's recommendation down to the cap-derived, risk-managed quantity of 160 units to avoid overstock while still replenishing pipeline toward the base stock target.

No arrivals are scheduled during Period 44. Demand outlook: recent sustained regime shows elevated weekly demand (carry-over Periods 36\u201340 avg=164) with a one-off spike P42=371; more recent weeks P41=103, P43=84 so demand is volatile but not persistently above ~160. Requirement to cover (L+1)=5 weeks: 5*164 = 820 units. Current total supply (on-hand + in-transit) = 736 units; however, 211 units arriving in P45 (within the 5-week window) plus the P47 arrival further reduces stockout risk. Ordering now would arrive in Period 48 (after 4 periods) and only help beyond the 5-week coverage window, while incurring holding cost $1/unit/period on extra inventory and risking excess if demand falls. OR recommends 0 \u2014 given substantial current inventory and imminent arrivals, I accept 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs while monitoring arrivals and demand next periods.

Requirement: with L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. Even using an elevated demand estimate of 160/week \xd75 = 800 units, current pipeline+on-hand = 628 covers most demand; using recent moderate demand ~110/week \xd75 = 550, we are sufficiently covered.
