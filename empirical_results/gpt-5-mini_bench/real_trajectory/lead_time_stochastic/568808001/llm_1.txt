Feb timing suggests rising demand approaching spring/summer wardrobe season. b) Demand regime: historical weekly samples show a clear upward trend: 2019-01-07=23, 01-14=29, 01-21=31, 01-28=38, 02-04=50 (steady increase, recent acceleration). I treat the near-term per-period demand as elevated vs. early-Jan. c) Lead_time & orders: supplier promised lead_time=2 periods. No concluded arrivals in history; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no evidence of shorter/longer lead time or lost shipments yet. d) Inventory & pipeline: Because arrivals occur after decision and promised L=2, I must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand with order + on-hand + in-transit. With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 I need to order for three periods. e) Final order logic: using recent acceleration I forecast ~60 units/period (slightly above the most recent 50 to account for trend and seasonal pickup). Multiply by 3 periods => order 180 units. This balances service (capture high-profit sales: $19/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period).",
