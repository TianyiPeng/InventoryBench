Product is a basic women's cotton V-neck T-shirt in mid-Feb\u2014no clear seasonality or upcoming event to change demand materially. Demand history (weekly samples: 36,21,10,12,16) yields sample mean 19 and sample std \u224810.4; OR used promised L=2 to compute a 3-period demand mean \u03bc\u0302\u224857 and \u03c3\u0302\u224818, with critical fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8 (z*\u22480.842), producing base_stock\u224872 and a cap\u224836\u201337. Assessment vs OR: Recent three weeks (10,12,16) show a lower short-run mean (~12.7) compared with the longer-run mean (19), suggesting the large 36 observation is an outlier rather than a sustained increase. Given no evidence of lead-time shortening/lengthening or lost shipments and the OR cap already limits order size to ~37, I accept the OR recommendation. Action rationale: Order 37 units to cover expected (L+1)=3 periods of demand per OR's capped base-stock while avoiding excessive inventory given soft recent demand and holding cost of $1/unit/period.
