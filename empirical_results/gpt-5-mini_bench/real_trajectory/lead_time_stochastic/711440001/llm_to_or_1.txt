Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly series shows four low weeks (10\u201311) then one large spike (74 on 2019-02-04). Spike is single-period (not yet sustained for 3+ periods), so do not declare a regime change. Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals to infer otherwise. Use default lead time and default demand moments (use full-sample mean/variance) to avoid overreacting to a single spike while the system collects more evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 demand=98, while historical weekly samples (5 weeks) have mean \u224823.4 with one large 74. Single high demand observation (P1=98) is not yet a sustained regime shift (needs \u22653 periods). Promised lead time remains 2 (no concluded arrivals to contradict). To adapt to the recent spike without overcommitting, use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weight the new observation while retaining historical info. Keep L=default (promised=2) and sigma_hat=default (use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service level for possible elevated demand while limiting holding cost if spike is transient.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand samples show low baseline (11,11,10,11) with one spike (74 on 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (orders placed P1=70, P2=137) but no concluded arrivals yet; only two missing arrival periods\u2014insufficient to declare lost shipment or changed lead time. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so OR backend applies its default base-stock calculation and caps while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand is high and elevated vs historic samples (Period1-3 demands = 98, 107, 81), indicating a clear upward regime versus old weekly samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (matches prior orders), so pipeline exists but has not yet been observed as arrived. I keep L=default (promised lead time=2) because actual lead time cannot be confirmed from conclude messages yet. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 3 observed periods) so the OR backend will raise the base stock and account for higher mean and volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Profit: $67.00, Daily Holding Cost: $70.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). History shows four consecutive high-demand periods (P1-P4 demands = 98,107,81,67) vs earlier small-sample history. Period 4 conclude confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). On-hand=70, in-transit=149; pipeline plus on-hand already large but demand regime has clearly shifted upward. I set L=default (use promised 2) because concluded evidence matches promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (4-period regime length). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices push the OR engine to size base-stock and cap using the recent higher mean and volatility, improving service while limiting excess hold given holding cost parity with profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg demand (P1-P4)=88.25 vs earlier sample mean=23.4 (+277%), sustained for 4 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime since Period 1 shows much higher demand (P1-P5 samples: 98,107,81,67,44; recent regime average \u224879.4 over 5 periods). On-hand=26, in-transit=195 \u2192 pipeline=221 which provides significant cover vs. forecast. Observed concluded lead time(s): order on P2 arrived on P4 (lead_time=2) \u21d2 actual lead time consistent with promised 2. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed lead_time=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (changepoint at Period 1, regime length=5). Sigma set to recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices focus the OR backend on the elevated recent demand while using confirmed lead time, avoiding understocking during the sustained demand increase and limiting excess holding given current large pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand has been elevated and stable since Period 1 (recent samples: P1-P6 = 98,107,81,67,44,55). On-hand=17, in-transit=167. Observed lead times from concluded messages: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1 (mixed). To capture recent higher-demand regime I use recent data for demand estimates (last 6 periods). For lead time I average the two most recent observed lead times to reflect the apparent shortening while acknowledging variability. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the sustained demand increase while using recent volatility to limit overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has been much higher than earlier samples (P1-P4 avg=88.25 vs earlier mean\u224823.4). Observed lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1 (mixed). Use calculated average lead time to let backend infer blended L. For demand forecast use the recent 4-period regime (N=4) to capture the sustained higher demand; same recent window for volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the new high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given its promised lead time and caps.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=149. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2 (P2->P4), P6:1 (P5->P6), P8:2 (P6->P8), P8:1 (P7->P8)} \u2192 average ~1.5; use backend 'calculate' to reflect observed variability. Recent demand has shifted vs earlier samples; last 4 realized demands (Periods 5-8 = 44,55,44,65) give a current representative mean (~52) and volatility. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current demand regime and avoids overstock given high holding cost equal to profit. This balances service level (cover lead+review demand) with holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=156. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); recent observed lead times (last 3 arrivals) = [1,2,1] -> average ~1.33, so use recent lead-time averaging to reflect variability. Demand history (P4\u2013P9 = 67,44,55,44,65,32) shows a lower, more stable recent regime versus the early spike; use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current operating regime. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while accounting for pipeline; parameters aim to reduce stockouts given mixed lead times and moderate recent demand, without inflating holding given $1 holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows a higher regime vs historic; last 4 periods demand (P7-P10) = [44,65,32,24], mean=41.25. To capture the recent regime while keeping sample size \u22653, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock for the (1+L) review+lead window using recent demand and observed lead-time, balancing service (covering backlog/in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg 1.4) so I use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period reality. Demand spiked early (periods 1\u20134) then moderated; recent demand (Periods 8\u201311 = 65,32,24,24) shows a lower recent regime. I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent N=4 periods to make the OR backend target inventory for the current lower demand level while the calculated L captures observed lead-time variability and reduces the risk of over-ordering given in-transit stock=149.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1} (avg=1.4); use calculate to capture observed average. Recent demand has declined from the early spike (P1-P4) \u2014 last 4 periods demand = [32,24,24,22], recent mean ~25.5; choose recent_N N=4 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce planned stock relative to the early spike while respecting observed lead-time behavior and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand has settled down from the earlier high regime; last 5 concluded demands (P9-P13) average ~24.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg ~1.4) with recent arrivals showing mostly 1\u20132 periods. I set L using recent_N to reflect the shorter recent lead-time evidence (N=3 to weight the latest 3 observed arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (last 5 periods). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to match the demand window. These parameters bias the OR backend toward lower (current) demand while acknowledging slightly shortened recent lead time and the large in-transit stock which will reduce ordering.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed sequence 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg\u22481.4), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand has softened: last 4 demands (P11-P14) = [24,22,22,40] \u2192 recent mean\u224827; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the lower recent regime and reduce overstocking given holding cost equals profit. These parameters target lower (1+L)-period demand based on latest stable observations while letting OR engine compute service-level z via profit/(profit+holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand softened starting Period 11: avg P11-P13=22.7 (P11-P13 = 24,22,22) vs earlier P1-P4 avg=88.25 (-74%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand softened since Period 11 (P11-13 avg \u224822.7) and on-hand=0, in-transit=149. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1} (avg=1.4) so I let backend calculate average lead time from observed samples. To respect the confirmed recent low-demand regime (sustained P11-13) I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts using the most recent regime (N=3 = P11-13). This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of ~22\u201325 weekly demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] (orders observed in P4,P6,P8,P8,P10), showing shorter-than-promised variability; use recent average to capture this. Demand softened starting Period 11 (P11-P16 = 24,22,22,40,25,9) \u2014 recent regime length = 6 periods, so use recent_N=6 for demand mean/volatility to reflect the lower demand. Choices: L=recent_N (N=5) to average last 5 observed lead times and capture lead-time variability; mu_hat=recent_N (N=6) to base forecast on the 6-period soft-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the current lower-demand regime while accounting for lead-time uncertainty and the sizable in-transit stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (large pipeline). Historical observed lead times vary (1\u20132); average observed lead time = 1.4 so use calculated average to reflect actual variability. Demand has been in the softened regime since Period 11 (recent demands: P11\u2013P17 mean \u224822.43, length=7). To avoid overstock given profit=holding ($1/$1) I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower regime; L set to calculate so the OR engine learns actual lead time from concluded arrivals. These choices reduce forecasted (1+L) demand to match the sustained low-demand regime and keep orders capped by the OR backend cap to limit holding cost while preserving service.

Demand regime softened starting Period 11 (P11-P18 demands = 24,22,22,40,25,9,15,12; recent mean=21.125).

Demand softened starting Period 11 (P11-P19 = 24,22,22,40,25,9,15,12,12); use the post-change regime for forecasts (regime length=9) to avoid overstock. Set L by calculating average observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (covers Period11-19) so the OR backend targets lower base stock appropriate to the sustained lower-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent demand regime softened since Period 11 (recent P11-P20 demand mean ~18), so forecast should use recent samples. Pipeline shows 149 in-transit and 0 on-hand; several past orders arrived with mixed 1\u20132 period lead times. I set L using recent observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 variability). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N on the last 10 demand observations (Periods 11\u201320) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and recent volatility. These parameters keep target base stock aligned to current lower demand while acknowledging pipeline inventory to avoid excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,1} \u2192 average ~1.5; use backend-calculated average to let OR learn true lead time. Demand regime: previous carry-over notes show a sustained softening starting Period 11; recent demand P11\u2013P21 is the current regime (11 periods) and should drive mu/sigma. Therefore set L by 'calculate' (average observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (use last 11 demand samples to reflect the lowered demand regime and recent volatility). This balances service (matching current lower demand) against holding cost while allowing OR to cap ordering using its cap rule given ambiguous in-transit stock.

Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 avg\u22481.4) because arrivals have mixed 1-2 period delays. For demand, use recent_N with N=12 (periods 11-22) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 samples, capturing the sustained lower-demand regime; set sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstocking from the prior high-demand regime while accounting for observed shorter lead times and current pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 11 (periods 11-23 demand roughly 24,22,22,40,25,9,15,12,12,9,8,4,4). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (sufficient to cover multiple weeks even if lead time varies). Observed lead times are mixed (1-2 periods); I take a recent-average to reflect this variance. For demand I use a recent-N estimate anchored to the low-demand regime (start Period 11) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean/volatility and avoid overstocking. These choices aim to keep base-stock near current weekly needs while letting the large in-transit buffer cover uncertainty and possible late arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 11 (samples P11-P24: 24,22,22,40,25,9,15,12,12,9,8,4,4,5). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 average ~1.4. To reflect observed lead-time evidence I select calculate for L so backend uses average observed lead time. Demand forecast uses recent data from the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 11\u201324) to avoid overstocking given holding cost equals profit. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=14 (the 14 most recent samples covering the low regime). Volatility can differ in the recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N=14. These choices reduce risk of excess stock while acknowledging shorter empirical lead time and current subdued demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. Recent demand has been low since Period 11 (most recent samples: P18-P25: 12,12,9,8,4,4,5,18) so I rely on recent demand to set forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (these are long-outstanding P1=70 and P4=79 orders) \u2014 ample pipeline stock exists so we should avoid aggressive replenishment. Several earlier arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20132 periods) and some orders remain overdue; I'll use calculated average of observed lead times to reflect historic delivery (method: calculate) and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has softened vs early spikes: last 6 demands (P21-P26)=8,4,4,5,18,30 (mean\u224811.5). Pipeline is large (in-transit=149) and on-hand=0, so avoid inflating demand forecast. Observed concluded lead times include mixed 1 and 2 periods (arrivals show lead_times 2,1,2,1,1); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime (focus forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 weeks). This keeps base-stock conservative to reduce holding cost given heavy existing pipeline while still covering expected near-term demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (many periods overdue \u2192 possible lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times: 2,1,2,1,1 (avg \u22481.4) so I use calculated average rather than promised to reflect observed variability. Demand has moved through regimes (high early, softened P11-P13, recent uptick P24-P27). To react quickly to the recent 4-period uptick (P24-P27 = 5,18,30,64) I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand volatility while L is set by calculate to capture observed average lead time. These choices raise the OR base-stock to improve service during the emerging uptick while keeping sigma based on recent variance to avoid overstock if the spike is transient.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick starting Period 24: avg P24-P27 = 29.25 vs prior P11-P13 avg = 22.7 (+28.9%), sustained 4 periods

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has rebounded since Period 24 (P24-P28 = 5,18,30,64,62) \u2014 recent mean is materially above earlier low regime. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods), so use historical average rather than default promised to reflect measured behavior. Set L via calculate (avg observed lead times = 1.4 \u2248 1\u20132 mix). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current uptick (covers P24\u2013P28) so mu_hat reflects the recent higher mean across the review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility (spike in P27\u2013P28). These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent rebound while keeping safety sizing tied to recent variability; they also help the OR backend mitigate stockouts from the observed 1\u20132 period lead-time mix and avoid excessive holding from older low-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has re-accelerated since Period 24 (P24-P29 = 5,18,30,64,62,67; recent mean ~34.3, last 4 avg ~55.75). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 units which likely covers multiple upcoming periods. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 avg ~1.4. To reflect recent higher demand while incorporating observed slightly-shorter lead times, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times, and use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint regime (start P24). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand forecast based on the most relevant recent samples and a matching volatility estimate to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has risen since Period 24 (P24-P30 high: 5,18,30,64,62,67,131). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg \u22481.4). Many earlier shipments arrived with 1\u20132 period actual lead times; promised=2 but evidence centers ~1\u20131.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (covers future demand partially). I set L using recent observed lead times to adapt to faster arrivals (recent average) so pipeline estimates match reality. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (last 7 periods, P24-P30) to capture the sustained uptick starting Period 24; this raises target base stock and variability to avoid stockouts given high recent weekly demand. These choices balance service (reduce lost sales during the uptick) against holding cost by using a recent-regime forecast rather than all-time average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times: {2,1,2,1,1} (avg=1.4) so I trust a shorter-than-promised average but will let backend compute average from observed data. Recent demand shows a clear high-demand regime since Period 27 (demands P27-P31 = 64,62,67,131,164); I treat the most recent 5 weeks as the current regime for forecasting. Choose L='calculate' to let observed lead times drive lead-time estimate; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to capture the current high-variance, elevated-demand regime. This increases target base-stock to improve fill rates during the recent spike while sigma_hat from recent data raises safety stock to reflect volatility. I do not record a new carry-over insight because the spike has not yet met the 3+ period stability threshold for a formal carry-over entry.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has ramped sharply since Period 27\u201332 (recent demands: 67,131,164,131) so I forecast using the most recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=280 \u2014 ample pipeline but some past orders showed mixed lead times (observed 1 and 2 periods); use a recent-average lead time to reflect variability. Chosen methods: L by recent_N to capture actual recent lead-time behavior; mu_hat recent_N (N=4) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last four high-demand weeks; sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has sharply increased since late Aug/early Sep (several very large weekly spikes: P30-P33 = 131,164,131,293). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have been irregular historically. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1} (avg=1.4), with the most recent observed lead_time = 1. To capture recent shorter lead behavior while smoothing older variability I set L via recent_N over the last 5 observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent demand samples (last 6 weeks P28-P33) to reflect the new high-demand regime; sigma uses the same recent window to capture elevated volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained spike, while recent_N for sigma prevents underestimating risk and keeps the capped order constraint meaningful given the large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 30: avg P30-P33 = 179.75 vs prior P24-P27 avg 29.25 (+514%), sustained 4 periods

On-hand=0, in-transit=424 \u2014 large pipeline that should cover near-term demand even if lead time varies. Observed concluded lead-times = [2,1,2,1,1,1] (avg=1.333), so use calculated average lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent 5 samples (P30-P34). Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the current spike while capping orders via its cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the spike) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=71, in-transit=358 \u2014 large pipeline covering several periods of recent high demand. Observed concluded lead times vary (recent observed W sequence includes 1,1,3); use a short recent average to reflect drift. Demand has spiked since Period 30; use recent demand samples to capture current regime but keep forecast horizon tied to chosen L. Params chosen to avoid over-ordering given heavy in-transit inventory while matching elevated recent demand: L set from recent lead-time observations (short-term average), mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent demand samples to reflect the current high-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent observed lead times (from concluded arrivals) = [2,1,2,1,1,1,3,3,1], avg \u2248 1.67 \u2192 use calculate to reflect observed average rather than promised 2. Demand recently peaked P30-P33 then softened P34-P36; last 3 periods (P34-P36) avg demand = 65.33 and better represents the current lower-demand regime. On-hand (186) + in-transit (209) = 395 units, which already covers multiple periods at the softened rate; choosing mu_hat recent_N with N=3 anchors the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast to the current regime and avoids over-ordering. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to estimate variability from the same recent regime. These choices reduce holding risk given high inventory while maintaining service for the current demand level and updated observed lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): demand has been in a high regime since Period 30 (sustained spike). Inventory: on-hand=123, in-transit=209 (total pipeline=332) which covers several weeks of elevated demand. Lead times have varied; recent concluded arrivals show a mix (1\u20133 periods) so I let the backend compute the average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent-N estimate focused on the post-spike regime (Periods 30\u201337, N=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high mean and volatility. These choices keep base stock responsive to the sustained spike while using realized lead-time evidence to avoid under/over-ordering given overdue/mixed arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=13, in-transit=244. Historical concluded lead times observed = {1,2,3} with average ~1.67; recent arrivals show some 3-period cases during the recent high-demand regime, so use the observed-average lead time estimator. Demand has a sustained spike starting Period 30 (P30-P38 high sales); use a recent_N demand estimate covering that regime (9 periods: P30-P38) to capture current elevated mean and variance. These settings push the OR backend to stock for the recent high-demand regime while reflecting observed lead-time variability and avoiding understock from assuming older low-demand history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=344. Recent concluded arrivals show variable but trending longer lead times (observed lead_times: 1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3 \u2014 recent cluster includes three 3-period observations). Demand has been high and volatile in recent weeks (Periods 32-39 demands: 131,293,96,60,40,63,110,76). To protect service while accounting for elevated recent demand and observed longer lead times, I set L using a recent average of observed lead times, and base demand forecast and volatility on the last 8 demand samples (most relevant regime). These parameters increase safety stock to cover the high recent demand spike while the pipeline (344 units) is considered by the OR backend when computing orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order P32\u2192arrived P35, order P33\u2192arrived P36, order P36\u2192arrived P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows confirmed longer lead time of 3 periods (multiple observed orders arriving with W=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=344 (large pipeline). Recent demand (P34-P40) remains elevated vs earlier low regime; I target the recent high-demand regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N on the most recent 7 demand samples (captures the current high-demand regime: P34-P40) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 7). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level during the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding by restricting forecasts to the recent regime and accounting for the long lead time; large existing in-transit stock will reduce ordering by the OR engine.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 (orders P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). On-hand=61, in-transit=238 (ample pipeline). Demand has softened after the Sept spike; recent 4-week demand (Periods 38-41) averaged ~75.8 units/week. To reflect confirmed LT=3 and the recent lower regime, set L explicit=3 and forecast demand using the most recent 4 periods (recent_N N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scaled volatility. This balances service (covering 4-week demand) against high holding cost given ample pipeline.

Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=242. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=3 (carry-over). Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike at Period 42 (148) after moderate values (P39-41 = 76,72,45). To be responsive to the most recent demand regime while accounting for confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use the most recent 4 demand observations (Periods 39-42) to capture the short-term level: N=4 (recent sample mean \u224885.25). This balances service (capture recent spike) versus holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a confirmed shift to actual lead time = 3 (several concluded orders: P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Recent demand is volatile after the large spike around P30\u2013P36; the most relevant observations for short-horizon replenishment are the last 4 concluded demands (P40\u2013P43 = 72,45,148,26). On-hand is 0 and a large pipeline (341) is already inbound; to best balance service vs holding given observed 3-period lead time and highly variable recent demand, I set L explicitly to 3 and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 4 demand samples to capture the current regime and volatility so the OR backend will size orders prudently against the incoming pipeline.

To account for observed LT=3 and recent demand behavior (P41-P44 = 45,148,26,26) I set L explicit=3 and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine centers the (1+L)-period forecast on the latest regime while reflecting recent volatility. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and avoids overordering if recent demand remains low.

Use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time. Demand has shifted several times; to capture the current regime I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the last 4 demand observations (most relevant for upcoming holiday-week demand uncertainty) while limiting exposure to older regimes.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has moderated after earlier spikes: last 4 observed demands (P43-P46) = [26,26,26,12], mean=22.5 per period. On-hand=65 + in-transit=238 => pipeline=303, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of forecast demand. Lead time has been confirmed previously as 3 periods; use that explicit estimate to protect against late arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples to reflect the current softened regime (N=4) so the OR engine targets service for the short-term lower demand while avoiding excess stock given $1/unit holding cost and $1/unit profit.
