Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 688432001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04) show no clear regime shift or seasonality; promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure coverage for the review+lead window while avoiding speculative adjustments, use default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This addresses missing pipeline by instructing the optimizer to target the standard base-stock for L=promised.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (155,98,122,119,142) give mean=127.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (ordered in P1, not yet concluded) \u2014 cannot confirm lead-time change. Promised L=2 retained. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This is conservative given no sustained changepoint and missing arrival still in-transit; defaults let OR engine size order to cover (L+1) periods of expected demand while accounting for profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~127.2; on-hand=0, in-transit=323 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1/P2 have not concluded). No sustained evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods (insufficient concluded arrivals); no clear demand regime shift. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps from full-sample moments. This balances service (use full-sample mean \xd7 (1+L)) vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent weekly demand samples (5 points: 155,98,122,119,142) show mean ~127. On-hand=0, in-transit=389 (orders placed prior periods). One expected arrival (order from P1) failed to conclude by its promised lead time, but this is a single missed confirmation\u2014insufficient to confirm a persistent lead-time shift or lost shipments. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (using historical mean across review+lead) while avoiding premature increases to safety stock given limited evidence of a sustained lead-time change. Monitor future conclude messages for confirmed lead-time shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows a single confirmed arrival: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2 (matches promised). On-hand=56, in-transit=230; arrivals from Periods 1 and 3 remain unconcluded (in-transit). Demand history (5 weekly samples: 155,98,122,119,142) shows no clear regime shift. I therefore keep lead time at the promised value and use default demand aggregations so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (avoid stockouts given existing in-transit) versus holding cost given current on-hand and pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and demand samples show weekly demand in the 100\u2013150 range. I keep L as the promised/default lead time (2) because concluded evidence matches promise and shipments have arrived. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available historical samples; this yields a base-stock that balances service level (uses profit/holding tradeoff) while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess inventory given holding cost equals profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~109 units (Periods 2-6 = 150,92,103,114,86) with moderate variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=283 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand and should cover multiple review+lead periods. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W=2 for P2\u2192P4 and W=1 for P5\u2192P6), so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concluded arrivals. To keep demand forecast responsive to the recent regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std reflect the last 5 observed weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts while we have high in-transit) against holding cost given profit=holding so target q=0.5. No single-period early/late arrivals are treated as sustained yet.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. To hedge this variability I set L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent 2 and 1). Demand history is limited to the provided weekly samples; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that trades off the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost under the averaged lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=254 -> substantial pipeline but recent periods show variability in arrivals (observed lead times: 2,1,2,1). Recent demand history (Periods1-8) shows average demand ~115.5 with a high spike last period (159) but not a sustained regime shift. I choose to let L be computed from observed lead times (average) so the backend adapts to mixed arrivals. For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples (conservative given no sustained demand regime change). This balances service level (captures lead-time uncertainty) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent demand samples (historical weekly mean=127.2, std\u224819.7) show no sustained regime shift; observed lead times have fluctuated between 1\u20132 but prior confirmed 2-period signal remains valid. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=360 \u2014 roughly covers 2.8 weeks of expected demand across review+lead (need \u2248381.6 for (1+L) periods). To be conservative yet stable, use promised lead time (default) and population-based demand estimates (default) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap using full historical stats; this balances service level (avoids large stockouts) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=54, in-transit=230. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistent with promised 2 periods (carry-over insight already recorded). Pipeline + on-hand (284) comfortably covers several weeks of typical demand; profits and holding costs are equal ($1/$1) so target service level is moderate. I choose default lead time (use promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) to avoid overfitting to recent noisy arrivals and because no sustained demand regime change is evident.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=290. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1) so use the average observed lead time. Recent demand has softened after a spike (last 5 concluded demand samples: P7-P11 = 99,159,82,76,76); use recent_N=5 to capture current lower regime while allowing the spike influence. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods using an up-to-date mean and volatility estimate while acknowledging lead-time variability and the substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=296. Recent demand volatile with a peak (Period 8=159) then lower weeks; last 5 demands = [159,82,76,76,118], mean\u2248102.2. Promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2; keep L as default. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower post-spike regime (N=5 per recent regime length), so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent realized demand over the (1+L) review+lead window and reflect recent volatility. This balances avoiding excess holding cost (holding=$1) while preserving service against the recent mean (~102/wk). Note: in-transit=296 covers ~2.9 weeks at recent mean, so parameters aim to avoid overstock while allowing replenishment given confirmed LT=2.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been volatile but historical weekly mean (Jan samples) ~127 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=247 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2), so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer effective L from observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given profit=holding cost and the sizable in-transit pipeline while avoiding overfitting to short-term spikes or possible lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand remains ~80\u2013160/week (historical samples: 155,98,122,119,142; game history demand mostly ~76\u2013159). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 \u2014 sufficient pipeline to cover multiple periods but arrivals are observed with mixed 1\u20132 period delays. Observed concluded lead times include 1 and 2 periods; using L=calculate (avg observed) lets backend infer the empirical lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a neutral forecast anchored to long-run data while L captures actual lead-time behavior. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit stock and mixed lead times) against holding cost for a low-profit, equal-holding-cost SKU.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg 1.625) but no sustained shift; demand history remains around ~100\u2013160/week without a clear regime change. I choose L by 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, preserving stability given no confirmed demand regime change. This balances service (using inferred average lead time) vs holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock already covers multiple periods of demand.

Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=332 (large pipeline). Historical weekly demand samples (training): mean=127.2, std\u224822.0. Recent arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period realizations but prior carry-over confirmed 2-period behavior; promised L=2 is retained. Use default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std given the large pipeline and symmetric cost (profit=holding) which implies z*=0; this avoids overreacting to short noisy lead-time fluctuations while keeping coverage for (L+1) periods of demand.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative given no clear recent shift and to let the capped ordering rule manage pipeline vs. holding tradeoff.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Past concluded messages confirm lead time = 2 periods (carry-over). Given limited reliable recent sales (many stockouts) I use defaults: keep promised/confirmed L=2 and set demand moments from all historical samples (2019-Jan weekly series mean=127.2) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean \u2248 3*127.2 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (covers 3 weeks of expected demand) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to sparse recent arrivals or lost shipments.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (arrivals observed consistent at P4 and P19 evidence). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=330 (large pipeline). No sustained demand regime shift detected in recent periods (demand samples remain within historical range). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full historical sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps parameters aligned with observed LT=2 and avoids overreacting to intermittent zero-arrival periods; large in-transit reduces need for aggressive up-front orders.

Promised lead time=2 and prior concluded messages confirm LT=2; no evidence of lost shipments recently (330 in-transit looks intact). I use default lead time (promised=2). I set mu_hat to default so backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples -> conservative multi-period demand (3\xd7127.2). I set sigma_hat to default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect aggregated variability over the review+lead period. No new sustained changepoints detected.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show predominantly 2 periods (confirmed at Periods 5 and 19); some single-period arrivals and many lost/delayed shipments but no sustained change in lead time or demand regime. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so backend service quantile q = 0.5; use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock computation using all samples and the promised lead time. This keeps parameters conservative given mixed arrival reliability and avoids overfitting to short noisy runs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Recent realized demand has dropped from ~127 (early samples) to ~74 over the last 5 weeks (Periods 18-22: 57,85,71,84,74). Pipeline is large (330) but not yet concluded; no new concluded arrivals in recent concludes. I set lead time to recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent observed lead-time behavior (most recent observed arrivals imply predominantly 2-period lead time). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast reflects the lower recent weekly demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices reduce target inventory vs. using the full-sample mean, avoiding excess holding cost while keeping service for the current lower-demand regime.

Recent concluded history confirms previous lead-time evidence but no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts; thus use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates. In-transit stock (330) will cover upcoming demand for several periods, so keep baseline (default) demand and volatility estimates to avoid overreacting to recent zeros which may reflect lost/late shipments. This balances service (profit $1 vs holding $1) by letting the OR backend compute base-stock with its default (1+L)-scaled mean and std.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29. Recent demand (Periods 15-24) is lower and more stable than early-sample winter demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=330 covers several weeks. Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time \u22482 in several periods. I keep L as default (promised 2) since evidence supports it. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (last 10 demand periods) to capture the recent lower summer demand regime and reduced volatility; this avoids overstocking from winter sample means while allowing the OR backend to size base-stock and cap appropriately given current pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand history shows regular weekly demand (many weeks in Jun\u2013Jul in the 50\u201390 range) and earlier samples (Jan\u2013Feb) averaging ~127. On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (undelivered). Concluded arrivals historically confirm lead time = 2 periods in multiple earlier observations; there have been many periods with no conclude despite in-transit units, suggesting delayed/non-concluded shipments but not yet proven lost. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time = 2) and use default demand aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This is conservative: it relies on long-run sample stats while the backend will cap orders; it avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delivery issues until arrivals/lack thereof are conclusively observed.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Concluded history shows actual lead times centered on 2 periods (some 1-period outliers) and many recent demands from Periods 12\u201326 (14 samples) averaging a lower level than the very first five sample seeds. I keep L at the promised/default (2) because concluded evidence overall supports ~2 and the backend expects promised lead time; I use recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the demand forecast to the most recent 14 observed demands (Periods 12\u201325/26) to capture the current regime. This balances service (using recent demand mean over the review+lead window) against holding cost given profit=holding so target fill is conservative but responsive to the lower recent demand. No shipments appear overdue (330 in-transit covers multiple periods), so parameters focus on recent demand behavior.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand history shows weekly demands mostly 50\u2013160 with many periods of zero sales after Period 11 indicating stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=330 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average \u22481.67 periods \u2192 use calculate so backend estimates average observed lead time rather than blindly using promised 2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while letting L-refinement adjust the review+lead demand window. This balances service (using observed shorter-than-promised average lead time) against holding cost given a large in-transit position and many recent stockouts.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent realized demand has been intermittently positive (historic series shows weekly demands 121,150,92,... up to 95) but on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 330. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4 and 13 etc.) confirm actual lead time = 2 in multiple prior instances. I use default lead time (promised 2) and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full history while the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the engine when arrivals conclude. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost given uncertain recent arrivals.

Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (many past promised arrivals absent \u2192 possible delays/losses). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history seed mean ~127.2/week; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap given chosen L. No aggressive override because demand regime shows no sustained shift over 3+ periods.

Recent realized demand (Periods 26-30 = 68,68,95,65,120) suggests a lower current demand regime vs early spikes; use recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the most recent demand level while limiting excess holdings given equal profit and holding cost.

Historical concluded lead-times show both 1 and 2 periods but promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed 2; use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. Recent demand (most recent 5 periods: P27-P31 = 68,95,65,120,115) shows a higher, stable level (~92.6 mean) versus earlier sparse periods; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current regime and reduce influence of early samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the elevated recent demand while respecting the promised lead time and the existing in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Historical concluded lead-time observations repeatedly show 2 periods (confirmed in prior carry-overs). I will use the promised lead time (default=2) so the OR backend computes base stock with L=2. Demand forecast and volatility will use the default methods (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because recent demand shows variability but no clear sustained regime shift; keeping defaults avoids overfitting. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock target aligned with long-run sample stats while the large in-transit quantity reduces immediate ordering need.

Historical concluded messages (Periods 4,13, etc.) support promised lead time of 2 periods. In-transit (330) appears sufficient to cover roughly three weeks of demand, so I will use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies the full-sample mean/variance for (1+L) review+lead demand. This avoids overfitting short-term noise and lets the backend cap orders given pipeline inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been ~60\u2013133/week (historical samples mean 127.2 from Jan 2019 samples provided). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 units (unconfirmed). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2] \u2192 average \u2248 1.67. Given mixed 1\u20132 period realizations, I use calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost using q derived from profit/holding. This approach accounts for the empirical lead-time pattern while deferring demand aggregation to the backend's default historical estimator.

Carry-over insight: Sustained missing/unconfirmed arrivals: no concluded arrivals for orders placed after Period 13 across Periods 14\u201334; 330 units currently in-transit remain unconfirmed and may represent lost/delayed shipment.

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time=2; given mixed arrival history but confirmed 2-period behavior earlier, use default L to let OR assume promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 15\u201334) shows a sustained regime with weekly demands ~50\u2013133 despite stockouts; base-stock should reflect this recent regime rather than the small Jan sample set. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 demand observations and their volatility, helping the backend size orders for (1+L) review+lead demand while avoiding overreliance on early data. This also hedges against the unconfirmed in-transit by basing forecasts on observed demand realizations.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (long-unconfirmed; prior carry-over flagged potential lost/delayed shipment). Historical confirmed lead time = 2 in earlier periods, but many subsequent orders failed to conclude; risk of lost shipments noted. I retain promised lead time (default) because confirmed observations historically support L=2 and missing arrivals more likely losses than a systematic longer lead time. Demand samples (provided) have mean ~127.2; using default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) gives the backend a stable forecast while the capped policy limits over-ordering against uncertain pipeline. sigma_hat left as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L), balancing service level (profit=holding so q=0.5) against holding cost under pipeline uncertainty.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (unconfirmed); sustained missing arrivals noted historically. Recent realized demand (Periods 30-37) shows higher and variable weekly demand vs early-year samples; keep L as promised (default=2) because concluded lead-times historically centered on 2 and no new confirmed change. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (Periods 30-37) so the OR backend targets current demand levels and volatility while avoiding overreliance on stale early-year data. This balances service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost given uncertain in-transit confirmation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (many unconfirmed arrivals since Period 14; risk of lost/delayed shipment). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in multiple earlier windows. Given no strong, sustained demand regime shift (demand samples span 2019 and backend will use full history), use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample statistics. This keeps parameters consistent with observed confirmed lead-time=2 while letting the OR engine compute base stock and caps; monitor for future concluded arrivals to revise if losses or lead-time changes are confirmed.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, In-transit=330 units but many arrivals since Period 14\u201339 remained unconfirmed and may be delayed/lost; last concluded arrivals show lead times of 1\u20132 historically. I choose L='calculate' so backend will average only observed concluded lead times (conservative inference from confirmed data). For demand forecast I use defaults (mu_hat and sigma_hat = 'default') so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overreacting to the large block of unconfirmed in-transit stock and relies on confirmed demand history. These settings balance service level (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost risk from the 330 unconfirmed units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent realized demand has fallen vs earlier samples (last 5 demand observations: Periods 36-40 = 58,29,40,46,36; recent mean ~41.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 units remain unconfirmed and likely delayed/lost per prior carry-over; no new concluded arrivals to change lead-time inference. To avoid overstocking against uncertain pipeline I keep promised lead time (default) so the OR engine uses L=2, but I downweight long-run historical high-demand weeks by using the last N=5 periods for demand mean/volatility. This produces a (1+L)-scaled recent mean for mu_hat and recent volatility for sigma_hat, reducing excess holding cost while maintaining service for current low-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent observed demand has fallen versus early samples (last 5 demands: 29,40,46,36,22; avg\u224834.6). Pipeline shows 330 units in-transit with no concluded arrivals since Period 13, suggesting lost/delayed shipments; historical concluded arrivals support a 2-period lead time but arrivals have stalled. To be conservative against potential longer actual lead times and avoid overstatement of available supply, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 samples). These choices lower target base stock to match reduced demand and extend the covered horizon to buffer for delayed arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=HoldingCost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (these in-transit units remain unconfirmed and likely delayed/lost based on Periods 14\u201334 missing arrivals). Recent demand shows a late-November spike (Period 42 demand=140) suggesting holiday/seasonal uptick. Because promised LT=2 has produced missing/unconfirmed shipments, I use an explicit conservative LT=3 to allow the OR engine to plan for longer effective lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (includes the late spike) so base-stock reflects short-term seasonality while limiting influence of long earlier history.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 units that remain unconfirmed across many periods (no conclude since orders placed after Period 13). Historical concluded lead times (observed): {2,1,2,1,2,2,2} -> use average observed lead time. To be conservative given missing arrivals, set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Use default demand forecasts (mu_hat/default and sigma_hat/default) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost without over-committing to potentially lost pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: shipments placed after Period 13 remain unconfirmed through Period 43; 330 units in-transit likely lost or severely delayed (sustained non-arrival from Periods 14\u201343).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent history shows sustained non-arrivals for orders placed after Period 13 and 330 units sitting in-transit unconfirmed; however only concluded arrivals up through Period 13 can be used to infer lead time. Demand historical samples (provided) have mean \u2248127.2/week. Promised lead time is 2 periods and earlier concluded lead-times were 1\u20132; no new concluded evidence to override promised lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) while avoiding aggressive explicit increases in forecast given ambiguous/missing arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 but prior carry-over indicates these in-transit units have been unconfirmed for many periods and likely lost/delayed. Historical concluded lead-times cluster at 2 (with occasional 1); demand history (multiple weekly samples 2019) shows no sustained recent upward shift. Given uncertain/possibly lost shipments, use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend\u2019s pipeline logic remains aligned with contract L and historical demand; use default demand and volatility estimates (all samples) to avoid overreacting to noisy recent zeros which likely reflect lost arrivals rather than true demand collapse. This balances service (by targeting historical mean demand coverage) vs holding cost (by not inflating safety stock for unconfirmed pipeline).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weekly demand (Periods 42\u201346) is low/variable (140,86,18,37,13) after long stretch of zero on-hand sales; on-hand=0, in-transit=330 units that have not concluded and are likely lost/delayed (see carry-over). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded lead-time evidence is stale and missing arrivals suggest loss rather than a stable longer lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the last 5 observed weekly demands (captures current lower holiday-season demand). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering against the large unconfirmed pipeline and align base-stock to current low demand, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.
