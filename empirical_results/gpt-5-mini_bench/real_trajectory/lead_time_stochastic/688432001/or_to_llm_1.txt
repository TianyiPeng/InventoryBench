Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows multiple lost/delayed shipments (Periods 1\u20133 lost then P4 showed arrivals; Periods 21\u201323 and 40\u201343 show varied lead times including a 3-period arrival). Carry-over insight already flags pipeline as unreliable; therefore I will NOT rely on the 1,048 units labelled 'in-transit' when making the decision. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 228 units. Recent observed weekly demand during Dec (P43\u2013P46) = 86, 18, 37, 13 (sharp holiday dip). Historical baseline (earlier sample set) single-week mean \u2248127, but current calendar date 2019-12-30 is the holiday period with suppressed demand. Cost tradeoff: profit = holding cost ($1 vs $1) \u21d2 critical fractile q=0.5 so safety stock has no upward bias; overstocking carries equal penalty to understocking. OR recommended 0 units; given large reported in-transit but unreliable pipeline, and current on-hand of 228 which covers several weeks even if demand reverts toward historical mean (~127/week covers ~1.8 weeks) and clearly covers low holiday demand, I choose to place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and to wait for confirmed arrivals (concluded messages) before trusting pipeline. Final strategy: order 0 units, monitor next period's conclude message to confirm which in-transit shipments actually arrived and update lead-time belief before placing new orders.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordered 0 units (agree with OR): pipeline flagged unreliable, on-hand 228 is sufficient through the holiday dip, and holding cost equals profit so avoid unnecessary replenishment until arrivals are confirmed.",
