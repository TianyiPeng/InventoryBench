Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 224606019 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. No concluded arrival history yet to infer actual lead time; demand history (5 samples) shows mean\u224849.2 units/week. Use promised lead time (default) and baseline demand estimates: set L=default so backend uses promised L=2. Use mu_hat=default to apply (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, retaining full-sample forecast given no evidence of a regime change. Use sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical mean while avoiding premature adjustments without concluded arrivals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical weekly demand samples (Jan) average ~49.2/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=61 from Period 1 order which concluded arrived=0 (delay observed) \u2014 insufficient evidence to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipment yet. Promised lead time is 2; I'll use default lead time so backend assumes promised L=2. Use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for profit/holding tradeoff. This keeps decisions conservative until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained pattern of missing shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=133. Two recent conclude messages show no arrivals yet but these are within the promised lead time window so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Historical weekly demand samples (41,59,44,49,53) give mean=49.2. Promised lead time (2) remains the best estimate; use default demand/volatility scaling for review+lead period (1+L=3). This provides mu_hat = 3\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(3)\xd7std to balance service level vs holding cost while awaiting confirmed late-arrival/loss evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=263 (orders placed P1=61, P2=72, P3=130) and no arrivals have been recorded in concludes for P1-P3. Promised lead time=2 but observed zero arrivals for three consecutive periods, indicating actual lead time is longer or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 to cover the extended transit risk. Demand history (5 samples: 41,59,44,49,53) shows no clear recent regime change, so I use default demand scaling: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These choices raise the target base-stock to provide service during the longer lead time while sigma scaling preserves uncertainty for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >2 periods: orders placed P1=61, P2=72, P3=130 have arrived=0 in Periods 1-3 concludes (no arrivals by Period 4), indicating sustained delay.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
224606019: ordered=127, arrived=72 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=72, demand=48, sold=48, ending on-hand inventory=24
Daily Profit: $912.00, Daily Holding Cost: $24.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent conclude shows order placed P2 arrived in P4 (lead_time=2), so actual lead time aligns with promised 2. On-hand=24 and in-transit=318 provides large coverage vs historical weekly mean (~49.2); pipeline + on-hand appears sufficient to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I choose conservative/default calculations so the OR backend uses promised/observed lead time and full-sample demand stats, avoiding overreaction to a short sequence of delayed/no-show concludes earlier. This balances service (using full-sample mean) while keeping holding cost in mind given already large in-transit quantity.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline but recent concludes show inconsistent arrivals: P1 and P3 orders did not arrive by Period 4 while P2 arrived with 2-period lag). Given repeated delays/missing arrivals, I increase lead-time estimate to 3 to force higher pipeline coverage. Using default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) keeps demand forecast anchored to historical weekly mean (samples: 41,59,44,49,53) while the longer L raises safety stock to protect service level amid delivery uncertainty. This balances profit vs holding cost by avoiding stockouts given observed shipment unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments suspected: orders from Period 1 (61 units) and Period 3 (130 units) had no arrivals by Period 4 concludes despite Period 2 arriving with 2-period lag; indicates sustained delivery unreliability and possible lead-time >2 or lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized demand has been higher and more volatile than the Jan samples (recent demands: P2-6 = 150,78,48,53,60). On-hand=0, in-transit=365, and multiple past orders (P1,P3,P5) failed to arrive on schedule\u2014evidence of lead-time > promised 2 or lost/delayed shipments. I set L explicit=3 to hedge against observed multi-period delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher/volatile regime from the last five observed demands; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock and safety stock to protect service given delivery unreliability while the large in-transit quantity limits order size via the OR cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=450. History shows one concluded arrival with lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) but multiple earlier orders (P1,P3 and later P6,P7) remain unconcluded \u2192 sustained delivery unreliability and risk of longer lead time or lost shipments. To protect service level while accounting for delays I set L explicit=3 (conservative above promised 2). I let mu_hat and sigma_hat use default rules so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging historical demand mean and variance) to produce a larger base-stock and safety stock given the longer review+lead period. This balances higher fill-rate against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=87, in-transit=318. Historical conclues show variable actual lead times (observed 2,2,1) and signs of delayed/lost shipments earlier. I choose recent_N for L (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time variability rather than trusting the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most relevant sample set (the provided 5 historical weekly samples) scaled by (1+L). Sigma uses default to reflect total-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices hedge against lead-time uncertainty while keeping the demand forecast tied to recent observed samples so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=41, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead times: P4 showed P2\u2192arrived (LT=2), P8 showed P6\u2192arrived (LT=2) and P7\u2192arrived (LT=1); several earlier orders never concluded suggesting delivery unreliability. I set L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period evidence). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and historical demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=2, in-transit=318. History shows variable actual lead times (observed W=2,2,1) and some missing/delayed shipments earlier, so use data-driven average lead time. Demand has shifted from early large spikes to a lower, stable regime since Period 5 (recent demands: 53,60,68,45,46,39 \u2192 mean ~51.8). To avoid overreacting to early spikes, I use a recent-window forecast (N=6) for mean and volatility to set base stock over the review+lead horizon; this balances service (captures current demand level) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times: P2->P4 = 2, P6->P8 = 2, P7->P8 = 1, while earlier orders (P1,P3) never concluded => delivery unreliability and possible longer effective lead time or lost shipments. To be conservative and protect service level given missing arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. Demand history (samples mean ~49.2) used with default demand aggregation to let backend compute (1+L)*mean across all samples; variance left to backend default. This raises target base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while relying on backend caps to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8) \u2014 some earlier orders (P1,P3) never arrived, indicating unreliable deliveries but observed lead times average ~1.67. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history average; mu_hat and sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, providing a conservative base-stock that accounts for multi-period coverage given variable lead time and existing large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=326. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1} so I use a short recent average to capture current variability. Recent demand has stepped up (recent demands: P9-P13 = 46,39,44,101,109) so I use a recent-window forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility. These choices aim to raise target stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid excessive holding cost given unreliable arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has risen (periods 12-13:101,109; 14:69) and several earlier orders never concluded, indicating delivery unreliability but concluded lead times observed = {2,2,1,2} (avg 1.75). I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time, and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances higher recent demand against many units already in-transit and avoids overreacting to noisy/possibly lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows P2\u21922, P8 shows P6\u21922 and P7\u21921, P14 shows P12\u21922 \u2014 mostly 2 with occasional 1; earlier extended no-arrival windows suggest delivery unreliability but not a sustained different LT. Demand has shifted upward starting Period 12 (sustained for 4 periods). I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 12-15). Sigma uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability and observed lead-time behavior; using recent data mitigates overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg demand before = 49.2 (early samples), recent avg Period12-15 = 84.0 (+71%), sustained for 4 periods

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 12 (periods 12-16 average = 74.6 vs earlier ~49.2), so forecast should use the recent high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 (some 1, one 2), average observed lead time ~1.75; use calculated average from observed concludes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime (Periods 12-16, N=5) to reflect sustained higher demand and higher volatility; this helps the OR backend raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding costs. On-hand=0 and in-transit=324 indicates large pipeline already; parameters focus on correct demand estimate and lead-time estimate.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline but history shows late/unreliable arrivals; several prior orders arrived with >1-period lag or not at all). Carry-over history suggests actual lead_time > promised 2 in several earlier periods. To be conservative against delayed arrivals I set L explicit=3. Demand shows a regime shift around Period 12 with elevated demand then a taper; to capture recent demand level I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 6 demand samples (Periods 12-17) to reflect the more recent mean/volatility while smoothing the earlier baseline. These choices bias orders upward relative to the old baseline to cover (1+L) periods of demand given delivery unreliability, while recent_N limits overreaction to one-off spikes and keeps holding costs manageable given high in-transit inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concludes show several late/possibly lost shipments (orders from early periods not arriving on promised 2-period cadence), so I conservatively estimate a longer effective lead time. Demand has been volatile with a notable spike around Periods 12-15 but quieter since; use an adaptive EWMA for mu_hat to weight recent observations while smoothing noise. sigma_hat left as default to reflect historical volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices aim to keep higher pipeline cover (longer L) while letting the EWMA adapt order quantities to recent demand, balancing lost-sales profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand history shows a sustained higher regime from Period 12 onward but I'll use default demand estimation ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula with the inferred L; sigma also default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (capture recent lead-time shortening) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods recently (several P arrivals with LT=1 or 2) though earlier delays/losses occurred; no new sustained lead-time change in the latest concludes. Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period 12 (recent demands elevated vs. early samples). Therefore use promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecast from recent samples to capture the post-change regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to use recent_N=9 (Periods 12\u201320) so the OR backend will size base stock to the higher recent mean and observed volatility while respecting the promised L and current large in-transit pipeline.

Recent demand has been elevated since Period 12 (as previously recorded). Given mixed 1\u20132 period observations and large in-transit volume, set L method to calculate (use average observed lead time) so backend accounts for empirically shorter-than-promised lead time; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), balancing service level vs holding cost while letting OR engine cap orders against pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand elevated vs. early samples (multiple weeks in mid-April\u2013July showing 50\u2013109, recent avg ~78). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline but earlier periods show delayed/lost arrivals), so I set a longer lead time to guard against further delays. L set explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery unreliability (multiple orders missing by promised 2-period window). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=8 to focus forecast on the recent higher-demand regime (captures recent volatility and mean); this will raise the base-stock to protect service level while sigma recent_N increases safety stock for uncertainty. These choices trade modestly higher on-hand risk for higher expected profit by avoiding lost sales given unreliable arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 12 (recent avg ~84 vs earlier ~49) and multiple delayed/lost shipments (several orders > promised 2-pt lead or never concluded). To protect service under unreliable deliveries I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the regime shift (use last 12 samples since the changepoint at Period 12 spans ~12 periods). Sigma is also estimated over the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices bias the base stock upward to cover the higher recent demand and the longer/uncertain delivery times while acknowledging holding cost is low relative to profit.

Date 2019/7/29 Period25. On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations show mixed 1\u20132 period outcomes; average observed lead time ~1.5 periods so I choose to let backend compute average from observed lead times (calculate). Recent demand has been lower than the earlier spike; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast and volatility to the most recent regime (Periods 20\u201324: 82,80,53,39,34). Using recent demand reduces excess holding given large in-transit volume while calculate L accounts for observed 1\u20132 period variability. These settings balance service (use pipeline + modest forecast) vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. History shows sustained delivery unreliability (multiple orders never concluded on promised LT=2) and a clear demand regime shift starting Period 12 (recent higher demand). To be conservative against delayed/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly longer than promised. For demand I use recent data since the regime change (Period 12 onward) to capture the higher mean/variance. Chosen: L explicit=3 to buffer for observed delays; mu_hat recent_N N=14 (use last 14 demand samples covering Periods 12\u201325 to reflect the new higher-demand regime); sigma_hat recent_N N=14 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service while recognizing holding cost via recent volatility cap.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (large pipeline with several orders that have not concluded \u2192 evidence of delivery delays or lost shipments). Promised lead time=2 but history shows variable/extended arrivals (some orders took 1\u20132 periods, multiple earlier orders never concluded by expected dates). To protect service and account for delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (no new confirmed demand regime change since previously recorded shift) so backend uses full-sample mean scaling for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances higher safety stock for unreliable delivery while relying on historical demand statistics to limit overstating demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been in the higher regime identified earlier (Period12-15 avg ~84, sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (multiple past delayed shipments; use concluded arrivals to infer lead time). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,1,1} (avg 1.5) so set L via calculated average to capture mixed behavior. For demand, use recent_N over the confirmed higher-demand regime (N=4 covering Period12-15+), so mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 4 demand samples to reflect the shifted mean and volatility and avoid dilution by low earlier history. These choices raise target base-stock to serve the new higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and delivery unreliability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (many units outstanding from early periods). History shows mixed concluded lead times (1\u20132) but multiple orders never concluded and large outstanding pipeline \u2192 evidence of prolonged delays/losses. I set L explicit=3 to guard against further unseen delays. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 12 (sustained higher demands); therefore I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (Periods 12\u201328) so the (1+L)-period forecast captures the post-change higher mean and volatility and reduces stockout risk while balancing holding cost given low holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical conclude messages show inconsistent arrivals (some orders with 1-2 period lead, many orders never concluded and remain in-transit), indicating delivery unreliability and effective lead time longer than the promised 2. Demand increased starting at Period 12 and has remained elevated; recent weeks show high demand (Periods 25-29: 34,56,36,30,54,83 etc.). To protect service given unreliable arrivals and higher recent demand, I set L explicitly to 3 (accounts conservatively for observed delays/losses). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime for the review+lead period. For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward a larger base-stock to avoid stockouts given the large in-transit position and unreliable shorter lead-times, while using recent data to avoid overcommitting to older low-demand periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 Period 31. On-hand=0, in-transit=355 -> large outstanding pipeline and evidence of delayed/lost shipments; historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132) but many orders never concluded, so I conservatively assume a longer effective lead time. Demand: early-sample mean=49.2 but a sustained higher regime was observed around Periods 12\u201315; recent observed weekly demand samples (Periods 26\u201330) = [36,30,54,83,60], recent mean=52.6. I set L explicitly higher than promised to cover likely delays, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the latest realized demand pattern over the review+lead period (1+L periods = 4). This balances higher service level (to deplete large in-transit when it arrives and meet recent elevated demand) against holding cost by using only recent demand data rather than inflating with all historic samples.

Concluded arrival history shows observed lead times = [2,2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 average 1.5; some earlier orders missing but only concluded messages used for inference. Set L via 'calculate' (avg observed lead time = 1.5) so backend accounts for realized delays. Use default demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat to leverage full historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) given no new sustained demand regime change beyond previously recorded shift at Period 12-15. This balances service (capture increased lead time) against holding cost while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show repeated delayed/no arrivals for many orders (P1,P2,P3,P6,P7 pattern) and prior carry-over flagged a sustained lead-time increase and lost shipments; pipeline is large but arrival uncertainty remains. Demand regime shifted up around Period 12 (recent avg ~84 vs earlier ~49) and this elevated demand has persisted through Period 32. I set L explicit=3 to conservatively account for observed delivery unreliability (promised=2 but multiple orders exceeded or never concluded). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 12\u201331 while limiting noise; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service during extended/uncertain lead times while using recent data to avoid under-forecasting the sustained demand increase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show mixed lead-times with several delayed/lost shipments earlier but most concluded arrivals indicate lead-times around 1\u20132 (recent observed lead_times: 2,2,1,2,1,1). Demand shifted upward around Period 12 and remained elevated; using a recent-window demand estimate will capture the post-shift regime while sigma uses full-sample variability. Choices: L set to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 mix); mu_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to weight recent higher-demand regime; sigma_hat set to 'default' to reflect overall demand volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to meet sustained higher demand while sigma/default keeps safety stock calibrated to full-sample variability to avoid excess holding given holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2,1,1} (avg=1.5) with recent variability but no sustained shift beyond 1\u20132 periods; earlier missing arrivals noted but recent concluded history is 1\u20132. Demand has been elevated since Period 12 (user insight) and recent weeks (Periods 30\u201334 demands = 60,65,50,60,92) show a higher mean. Therefore: set L based on the recent observed lead times (recent_N=6) to capture current supplier behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent demand (last 5 weeks) to reflect the higher recent demand regime and recent volatility. These parameters bias the backend toward stocking for the elevated recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering given in-transit volume.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 65,50,60,92,72) averages ~67.8. On-hand=0 but in-transit=355 units; many past orders have been severely delayed or possibly lost (multiple orders from P1-P3/P6-P7 arrived late or not at all), so actual lead time looks > promised 2. To be conservative against continued delivery unreliability, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher demand regime (post-Period12 shift) using the most recent 5 weeks. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while acknowledging transit uncertainty (explicit longer L reduces chance of under-ordering when shipments are slow).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 but history shows repeated delayed/lost shipments (many orders exceeded promised L=2), so I assume a longer effective lead time. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P32-36 = 50,60,92,72,67) averages ~68.2/week; I use recent_N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime. Set L explicit=3 to buffer against observed delivery delays. mu_hat uses recent_N=5 so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples (captures elevated demand). sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to protect service level given unreliable arrivals while limiting overreaction by using a short recent window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20132) and several long-missing shipments (P1=61, P3=130) suggesting shipment loss/delivery unreliability; nevertheless concluded lead-time observations cluster around 1\u20132 so I will keep promised lead time for the OR engine. Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime starting Period 12 (noted previously). To capture the new higher demand regime I use recent demand statistics over the last 20 concluded periods (captures sustained shift while limiting noise). I apply the same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the higher recent demand while relying on the promised lead time; keeping L=default avoids over-committing to an estimated lead-time when some shipments appear lost rather than consistently slow.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 and history shows repeated late/no arrivals (multiple orders >promised 2-pt lag), so I treat lead time as longer than promised to avoid under-ordering. Demand has been elevated since Period 12; recent realized weekly demands (Periods 34-38 = 92,72,67,69,41) average ~68.2. I set L explicit=3 to hedge against observed delivery delays/lost shipments. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility, balancing service level (profit$19 vs hold$1) against holding cost while avoiding understock if shipments remain delayed.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 \u2014 many outstanding shipments have been delayed or not concluded for extended periods. Historical conclude messages show frequent lead-time >2 or lost shipments (multiple orders placed P1\u2013P3 never arrived by P4; subsequent arrivals often 1\u20132 periods but many gaps). To protect service level given large unseen pipeline and persistent delivery unreliability, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised to force the OR engine to hold more cover: L explicit=4. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history (this scales demand coverage and variability with the longer review+lead period). This balances higher service with holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=389. Historical concluded lead-times show variability and multiple missing/delayed arrivals (some orders never concluded by promised L=2). Demand regime increased around Period 12 and has remained elevated. To hedge against delayed/lost shipments I set explicit L=3 (conservative above promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability; same recent window for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to protect service level given unreliable deliveries while using recent data to avoid overreacting to very old low-demand samples.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=389 (many earlier orders still unresolved). Historical concludes show inconsistent arrivals and multiple delayed/lost shipments; actual lead time appears longer than promised 2 periods. I choose L=recent_N with a short recent window to reflect observed longer, variable delivery delays. Demand recently (last 6 concluded periods) has mean ~44.8; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the forecast on the most recent regime and limits contamination from earlier low-inventory zeros and the mid-year spike. These choices raise the pipeline coverage for the longer inferred lead time while keeping demand forecast tied to recent observed demand, balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=389. History shows multiple overdue/lost shipments (orders from early periods never concluded) indicating actual lead time often exceeds promised 2 or shipments are unreliable. To be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 to account for extended/misreported lead times so pipeline coverage (1+L) targets more future demand. With L=3 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce the capped base-stock while reflecting the longer effective lead time. This avoids under-ordering given the large in-transit uncertainty and balances service level vs holding cost by relying on backend's profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show variable/long deliveries (some 1\u20133 periods) and recent confirmation of 3-period arrival (P40\u2192P43). Demand regime previously shifted up around Period 12 and has remained elevated. Given observed unreliable/longer lead times, I explicitly set L=3 to guard against understocking. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the elevated recent demand regime while smoothing older low-demand history. I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings increase the backend base-stock to better cover (1+L) periods of higher demand and account for longer delivery times, trading extra holding cost to avoid lost sales given high profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on Period 40 arrived on Period 43, lead_time=3).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16): on-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show variable lead times with a confirmed 3-period lead time (order P40 arrived P43). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 12 (carry-over note) so I use a recent demand sample window. To ensure the pipeline covers the longer observed lead time and higher recent demand, I set L explicit=3. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to capture the post-changepoint demand mean/volatility (short, recent window to react to sustained higher demand). This increases target base-stock to protect service level given unreliable shorter lead-time arrivals while avoiding overly large holdings because holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=418 (large pipeline from prior orders) and last conclude (P45) shows ordered=63 with no arrival yet. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed samples: 2,2,1,2,1,1,3) and a confirmed longer lead-time event (3 periods) plus earlier delays/losses. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 12. To account for uncertain/variable lead time while letting the OR engine estimate central tendency from observed lead times, set L to 'calculate' (average observed). For demand, use a recent_N forecast to capture the post-Period-12 higher-demand regime; choose N=20 to weight recent high-demand history while smoothing noise. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices (calculate L, recent demand mean and recent volatility) let the backend raise base-stock appropriately for the sustained higher demand and adapt to the empirically observed longer/variable lead times and delayed arrivals while limiting excess safety stock via a recent-window volatility estimate.

Historical concludes show variable and at-times delayed arrivals; lead time was observed =3 (order P40 arrived P43) and multiple earlier delays/lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand has shifted up since Period 12 and recent weeks (Periods 42-46 demands = [135,67,80,62,61]) show a higher recent mean; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime. This balances higher service level needs (capture recent elevated demand) while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock given holding cost=$1/unit.
