  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 is year-end/holiday period; recent weeks show elevated demand (periods 42\u201346 avg \u224871/week) so expect demand near ~70 this week. Lead time & pipeline: historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 periods; current in-transit = 1047 likely contains multiple expected shipments and will cover upcoming weeks. Coverage calculation: need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand after decision \u2192 3\xd770 \u2248210 units. On-hand 0 + in-transit 1047 >> 210, so no new order required. Holding cost vs profit: avoid adding inventory to reduce holding costs while meeting service. Decision: place 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs given ample pipeline.",
