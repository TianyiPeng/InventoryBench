Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [229,49,68,62,42] (through 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover review+lead period. Evidence of a sustained drop after the first sample: last 4 weeks average ~55 vs full-sample mean 90. I set L=default (use promised 2) because no concluded arrivals yet to infer a different lead time. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the lower recent demand regime and avoid overordering driven by the 229 outlier. I also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the current lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for expected demand; missing shipments will be monitored in future concluded messages and will trigger lead-time adjustment if observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: periods 2019-01-14 to 2019-02-04 avg=55 vs full-sample avg=90 (drop ~39%)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand has fallen vs full-sample (Period1 insight: 2019-01-14 to 2019-02-04 avg=55 vs full-sample avg=90). On-hand=0, in-transit=75 (ordered Period1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence lead time differs from promised. Use L=default (promised L=2). Use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=4 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (samples 2019-01-14 to 2019-02-04). This reduces target base-stock vs full-sample average, lowering overstock risk while preserving service given in-transit stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/25 (Period 3). Recent data show a sustained lower-demand regime (2019-01-14 to 2019-02-04 avg ~55 vs full-sample avg 90). On-hand=0, in-transit=153; P1 and P2 orders have not concluded yet so no confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default). Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (4 most recent regime samples). Use recent volatility from the same 4-sample window to reflect reduced variance. These choices reduce overstock risk given many units already in transit while maintaining service for the lower recent demand level.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (orders from P1-P3). No concluded arrivals in history => cannot confirm a lead-time change despite overdue-looking pipeline. Recent demand has dropped vs full-sample (recent avg \u224857 vs full-sample 90). Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals confirm longer L. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the lower recent mean (reduces over-ordering). For sigma use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. This balances service level (use recent demand estimate) against holding cost given existing large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent on-hand=47, in-transit=86. Concluded history shows an arrival in Period 4: 78 units ordered on Period 2 (lead_time=2 observed). Orders from Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (11 units) have not concluded and appear missing/delayed. Demand recent sequence (Periods1-4) = [36,55,48,31], recent mean = 42.5. Given confirmed lead time=2 (matches promised) and clear downward demand shift vs full-sample, set L to default (promised), use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower regime and recent variability. Recent N=4 captures the last 4 observed demands (min 3, capped by available). This raises service against current lower demand while avoiding overstock from older high-demand samples. The choices hedge service level given confirmed lead time and flag potential lost shipments in pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 4 arrival: 78 units ordered on Period 2); Possible lost shipment: 75 units ordered on Period 1 have not arrived by Period 4 (overdue).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has declined vs full-sample (recent 5-period mean ~38.6 units/week). Observed lead time evidence: one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2. Current inventory: on-hand=24, in-transit=97 (pipeline=121) which roughly covers (1+L)\xd7recent demand. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 2-period actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower recent regime. For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders to recent lower demand while honoring the confirmed lead time and existing in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering given a possible lost older shipment.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent realized demand has trended down from historical sample means: last 5 period demands = [55,48,31,23,20] (Period2-6) \u2014 lower regime vs full-sample. On-hand=15, in-transit=100; note a potentially lost Period1 order (75) remains unarrived per history but already recorded. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival from P2) and 1 (P6 arrival from P5) -> use recent average to reflect variability. Choice: L set via recent_N (N=2) to capture recent observed lead-time variability (avg 1.5). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to focus forecasting on the new lower-demand regime (covers last 5 demand observations). These parameters bias the OR engine toward stocking for the lower recent demand while recognizing lead-time uncertainty and existing in-transit stock, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has fallen vs. full-sample (recent periods showing ~20\u201355, lower than historical mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=114; note possible overdue/lost shipment: 75 units ordered in Period 1 still not concluded. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) -> use averaged observed lead time. Use recent demand to capture the lower regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 periods. These choices help the OR backend target service while avoiding excess holding given lower demand and evidence of delayed/lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has been lower than the full-sample historic mean (confirmed regime drop recorded earlier). On-hand=8 + in-transit=86 => pipeline_inventory=94; note the older Period 1 order (75) remains unarrived (possible lost) but already recorded. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast: use recent data to capture the lower regime; choose recent_N with N=5 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demand samples. Volatility: use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce overstating demand from the older high sample (229) while letting the backend compute base_stock and cap; they balance service level (covering review+lead periods of current lower demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand and substantial pipeline.

For demand I use a recent_N forecast (last 6 periods, Periods 4-9) to capture the sustained lower regime; apply same recent window for volatility. These parameters bias orders toward the recent lower demand while letting the OR engine account for risk and the promised LT.

Recent demand has fallen vs full-sample; last 5 demand samples (Periods 6-10) avg ~22.6 units. To be responsive to the lower recent demand while respecting promised lead time, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the recent 5-period regime so the OR backend sizes base-stock for the current lower-demand regime and caps orders appropriately, reducing overstock risk given holding cost >0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=86. Historical concluded lead times: {P4 from P2:2, P6 from P5:1, P8 from P6:2, P8 from P7:1} => recent observed avg ~1.5 and evidence of mixed 1\u20132 periods plus at least one lost/overdue shipment (P1 order never concluded). Demand has been lower than full-sample mean since 2019-01-14 (carry-over noted) but recent periods show high volatility (large spike to 131 in Period 11). To balance service and holding cost: infer lead time from recent observations (recent_N N=4) so L reflects actual short-run variability; use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent demand spike but retain some smoothing against one-off spikes; use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current increased volatility. These settings help the OR backend produce a base_stock that responds to recent lead-time behavior and recent demand volatility while avoiding overreaction to a single extreme period and compensating for possible lost shipments via slightly higher inferred lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=268. History shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods) with average ~1.5; recent demand has spiked in the last two periods but prior periods are lower. There is an overdue/lost-order signal (75 units ordered Period 1 not concluded). To balance service vs holding cost: use a recent-average lead time to capture recent variability (avg of last 4 observed lead times), and use recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the recent demand regime including the spike while avoiding overreacting to a two-period blip. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices help the OR backend set base-stock reflecting current demand and variable lead time while limiting overstock from potentially transient spikes.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Recent history shows a clear demand uptick: Periods 11-13 demands = [131,179,70] (3 periods). Past baseline (Periods 2-5) averaged ~55 after earlier drop. Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8)] \u2192 recent variability around 1\u20132 periods. Given overdue/lost shipments earlier but recent confirmations of both 1 and 2 period arrivals, I use recent average lead time to reflect realized mix. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 demand samples (most recent sustained change) so the backend inflates target base-stock for current elevated demand. This balances service level against holding cost by reacting to the confirmed demand increase while using observed lead-time variability to avoid under-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand for Periods 11-13 = 126.7 vs prior recent avg ~55 (+130%);

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Current on-hand=132, in-transit=278. Noted overdue/lost shipment: 75 units ordered Period 1 still not concluded. Observed realized lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} (avg ~1.6) and recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 11 (periods 11-14 demand = 131,179,70,50; recent avg ~107.5). To account for mixed observed lead times without overcommitting, set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. For demand, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (1+L scaled by recent mean), and set sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher target stock to meet elevated demand while keeping volatility-based safety stock limited to recent behavior; flags overdue shipment evidence so future periods can reassess if arrivals remain missing.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent demand regime: sustained spike beginning Period 11 (Periods 11-13 avg ~127 vs prior ~55). Current inventory: on-hand=111, in-transit=278. Observed concluded lead times (most recent 5): {2,1,2,1,2} \u2192 avg ~1.6; shipments show variability and some overdue/lost history but majority recent arrivals ~1\u20132. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect observed mixed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint higher demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock responsive to the higher recent demand while not overcommitting given variable lead times and significant pipeline on-hand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=87, in-transit=278. Observed concluded lead times (most recent): [2,1,2,1,2] -> average ~1.6; variability in arrivals and past overdue shipment(s) motivate using recent observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 11-16) shows elevated spike around Periods 11-13 then lower/variable demand in Periods 14-16 (50,21,24); to be responsive to the most recent realized demand, I use recent-window demand estimates. Choices: L: recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent observed lead-time mix (~1.6 \u2192 backend will average); mu_hat: recent_N (N=6) to capture recent realized demand across the review+lead period and be responsive to the post-spike drop; sigma_hat: recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings bias orders toward recent behavior (protect against late/lost older shipments and the recent spike), balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=79, in-transit=278; notable overdue shipment: 75 units ordered Period 1 still not concluded. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} (recent 5). Demand has had large regime swings (low early Apr\u2013May, spike around Periods 11\u201313) but recent realized demand (Periods 13-17 = 70,50,21,24,8) averages ~34.6 \u2014 I bias forecasts to recent realized demand. Set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent mix of 1\u20132 period realizations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine uses the most recent demand regime (captures post-spike return toward lower/variable demand) while pipeline adjustments account for overdue shipments. These choices balance service (protect vs. recent spikes) and holding cost (recent lower mean).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand (Periods 15-18 = 21,24,8,5) has returned to a low regime after the short spike around Periods 11-13. Current inventory: on-hand 74 + in-transit 278 = 352 units (ample coverage vs recent low demand). No new lead-time evidence since Period 14; promised lead time remains appropriate. I set L=default to use the promised 2-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 15-18). This biases the base-stock toward the recent low demand while the large pipeline reduces immediate ordering need, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has fallen from prior spike; last 5 periods demand = [21,24,8,5,4] avg\u224812.4. Current inventory on-hand 70 + in-transit 278 = 348, ample coverage. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] -> average \u22481.6, so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data while letting backend compute exact average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) since current pipeline is large and no new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded shifts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent history shows actual lead times observed = {2,1,2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.6 but noisy; shipments have been arriving mostly with 1\u20132 period lag and some earlier lost/overdue orders noted. Demand has fallen from the April spike (Periods 11-13) and settled into a low regime since Period 14 (demands for Periods 14-20 = [50,21,24,8,5,4,1], recent avg \u224815.6). To keep pipeline appropriate while avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand (69) and large in-transit (278), I use a lead-time estimate based on observed average and set demand forecast using the most recent stable regime. This reduces ordering versus using the full-sample high mean and thus balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has settled low after the spring spike: last 6 concluded demands = [24,8,5,4,1,4] (avg ~7.7), while earlier Periods 11-13 showed a transient spike. Current inventory (on-hand 65 + in-transit 278) is ample versus near-term demand, but some earlier orders were overdue/lost; however recent arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times. I set L to recent_N=5 to let the backend learn the current effective lead time (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2], avg=1.6). For demand I use recent_N=6 to focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (covers the last 6 periods). For sigma I also use recent_N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding excess inventory build-up while maintaining service through the in-transit pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 15: periods 15-22 demands = [21,24,8,5,4,1,4,0], avg \u2248 9.6, well below prior recent avg \u224855. On-hand=65, in-transit=278 (pipeline ample). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} \u2192 avg \u22481.6. To capture the confirmed low-demand regime I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine uses empirical lead-time; I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the demand forecast and variability on the 8-period low-demand regime (keeps target base-stock small to avoid holding cost while pipeline covers service).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand for Periods 15-22 = 9.6 vs prior recent avg ~55 (\u221282%), sustained over 8 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 15 (avg ~7.7 units/week over P15-23). On-hand=63, in-transit=278 (ample pipeline). Observed historical lead times have been 1\u20132 but promised lead time is 2; keep L as default (promised=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (uses P15\u2013P23 samples) so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding given high pipeline and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 15 (avg ~9.6 over Periods 15-22) and arrivals/lead-times previously confirmed at 2 with some isolated 1-period arrival and an overdue/lost shipment. Current inventory is high (on-hand 51, in-transit 278) so we prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while covering near-term low demand. Set L to default (promised 2). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 15-22); same N for sigma to reflect current low volatility. These parameters guide the OR backend to lower base-stock reflecting the new low-demand regime and reduce ordering cap risk given large pipeline inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Current on-hand=31, in-transit=278. Historical concluded lead times: observed = {2,1,2,1,2} \u2192 avg ~1.6. Use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. Set L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed average. Demand samples show multiple regime shifts historically; no new sustained shift in recent periods (demand low and stable past 8+ periods). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given high pipeline stock (278) and modest on-hand. This avoids over-ordering while letting OR engine account for observed lead-time average.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been low but variable (past 8 periods avg ~9.6 with upticks last 4 weeks); current on-hand=9, in-transit=278 (pipeline large relative to on-hand). Historical concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} (avg \u22481.6); there is one long-overdue order (75 units from Period 1) that remains unconfirmed and may be lost, but arrivals since Period 4 match a ~1-2 period pattern. To balance service and holding cost given a large pipeline and uncertain but lower recent demand, set lead time to the observed average (calculate) and use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine scales base-stock by (1+L)\xd7full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, avoiding overreaction to short recent upticks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=278. Recent demand (Periods 21-27): [4,0,2,12,20,22,36] shows rising demand from very low base; historical contains multiple regime shifts. Use observed lead-time history (1,2,2,1,2) \u2192 let backend compute average lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N=7 to capture the most recent upward trend over the last 7 weeks (covers current regime). Use same recent_N=7 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the latest demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior so pipeline covers review+lead period without overstocking given holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 15 (avg \u22489.6 over Periods 15-22 and continued low through Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=278 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current weekly demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use calculated average to let backend infer actual typical lead time. Choose mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent samples to reflect the low-demand regime (reduce overstock risk). These choices bias orders downward to preserve profit vs holding cost while relying on large existing in-transit inventory to cover near-term demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=278. Historical concluded lead times (using only conclude messages) show variability: recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] (average 1.6). To capture this recent mix I use recent_N for L with N=5 so backend estimates current effective lead time from observed samples. Demand history contains multiple regime shifts already recorded; no new demand regime detected. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given the chosen L estimate and existing pipeline.

History shows mixed lead times (observed: 2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg ~1.6) and at least one overdue/lost early shipment; recent demand has a large spike (Period 30=172) but not yet a sustained new regime. To balance service level vs holding cost I let the backend infer an empirical lead time average and keep demand/volatility estimation defaults so the OR engine uses full-sample stats adjusted by the computed L. This avoids overreacting to the single large recent spike while accounting for variable lead times.

Keep promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting given mixed observed lead times. Use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to react to the large recent demands (captures last 5 periods: P27-P31). This balances service (respond to surge) vs holding cost by updating forecast and variability while keeping L conservative.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23. Recent demand has spiked sharply in Periods 30-32 (172,186,234). On-hand=0, in-transit=393 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] (most recent 5 observations avg=1.6), so use recent lead-time estimate to let OR backend adjust review+lead horizon. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the new high-demand regime (last 5 demands = 27,40,172,186,234) while pipeline provides coverage; this reduces risk of stockouts during the spike but keeps holding exposure limited since holding cost is high relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand for Periods 30-32 = 197.33 vs prior recent avg ~40 (increase ~394%);

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=531 (large pipeline from recent orders). Historical concluded lead-times show both 1 and 2 periods (samples: 2,1,2,1,2; avg\u22481.6) so I let backend compute average observed lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 30 (Period 30-33 show large spikes: 172,186,234,352). I therefore use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 4 periods). Volatility should also reflect the recent upsurge (use same recent_N=4). These choices keep orders responsive to the current high demand while relying on observed lead-time evidence; with in-transit=531 we avoid aggressive additional ordering now.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent weeks (Periods 30-34) show a strong, sustained jump in demand (172,186,234,352,222) vs earlier low-volume regime; pipeline is large (in-transit=828) and on-hand=0, so we must avoid over-ordering while meeting elevated demand. Observed concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods (evidence: P4 arrival ordered P2 lead_time=2; P6 arrival ordered P5 lead_time=1; P8 arrivals show 1 and 2; P14 arrival ordered P12 lead_time=2) \u2014 use calculated average lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, forecast demand using recent 5 periods (Periods 30-34). Use recent volatility over same window so the OR backend targets service with appropriate safety stock while the cap limits order size given large pipeline.

Date 2019-10-14. On-hand=0, in-transit=713 (large pipeline). Recent demand has shifted sharply up: last 5 demands (Periods 31-35) = [186,234,352,222,167], recent mean ~232. To protect service given observed slower arrivals (most recent order P32 arrived in P35), I set lead time = 3 periods (explicit). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover the current high-demand regime (1+L multiplier applied by backend). This balances higher fill-rate (profit>holding cost) while limiting extra safety from older low-demand periods. The chosen L and recent-N focus the model on the confirmed high-demand, slightly longer-lead environment and the large in-transit pipeline will be used by the capped ordering policy to avoid overordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order on Period 32 arrived Period 35)

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 30-36 large weekly demand). Current inventory: on-hand=6, in-transit=913 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show lead_time = 3 periods (orders P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36). To align OR decisions with observed shipping reality and recent demand, I set L explicitly to 3. I forecast demand using the most recent 3 weeks (capture the current high-demand regime) and estimate volatility from the same 3-week window. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the elevated demand while the large pipeline reduces immediate order size risk.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 30 (multiple weeks of 170\u2013352). On-hand=0, in-transit=913 (large pipeline). Lead time behavior has been confirmed as 3 periods (orders from P32,P33 arrived at P35,P36). To avoid underordering given confirmed longer lead time and the recent high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period-30 high-demand regime (available recent regime length = 8 periods: P30\u2013P37). This balances service (capture elevated mean) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=917. Historical concludes show actual lead time has shifted to 3 periods (order P32\u2192arrived P35); recent demand regime (Periods 30-34) shows large spikes (172,186,234,352,222). To avoid stockouts given large pipeline and sustained high recent demand, set L explicit=3 to match observed arrival delays. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures weeks 30\u201334), balancing service level while the OR backend applies caps.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=288, in-transit=579. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has recently been 3 periods (confirmed P35 arrival for P32 order and multiple P33/P36 arrivals), so use aggregated observed lead times. Demand has shifted to a higher recent regime (large demands in Periods 34\u201339); to capture current demand level I use a recent-N forecast (last 6 periods) for mean and volatility so the base-stock covers the review+lead period under the current regime while limiting excess from older low-demand periods. These choices help the OR backend raise target stock to maintain service given longer observed lead time and recent high demand, while sigma from recent data sets safety stock appropriately.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=237, in-transit=579. Recent concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (orders: P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Recent demand (Periods 34\u201340) = [222,167,132,120,165,50,51], mean=129.6. I therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead-time=3. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current high-then-drop regime: mu_hat recent_N N=7 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Volatility also from the same recent window to reflect observed variability: sigma_hat recent_N N=7. These choices align order targets with confirmed longer lead time and recent demand pattern, balancing service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed Period 32\u219235, 33\u219236, 36\u219239). On-hand=190, in-transit=579 (pipeline large). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering given delayed shipments. Demand has clearly shifted through multiple regimes; to remain responsive to the most recent high-volatility regime I use recent_N=5 for demand forecast and volatility (captures Periods 37-41 demand: 120,165,50,51,47). Using recent_N keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the recent higher average while accounting for variability. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing orders to cover (1+L)=4 periods of recent demand while recognizing elevated lead time and sizable pipeline inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows lead time has been 3 periods (confirmed P32\u2192P35 and repeated arrivals at LT=3). On-hand=116, in-transit=579 (ample pipeline). Demand in the last 5 concluded periods (P38\u2013P42) is {165,50,51,47,74} \u2014 elevated volatility but service should prioritize avoiding stockouts given current pipeline and profit/holding ratio. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest regime including the recent spike and subsequent moderate weeks. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances higher service (protecting against ongoing high demand weeks) with holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history confirms actual lead time increased to 3 periods (observed arrivals: P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Current inventory: on-hand=87, in-transit=579 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed longer lead time while anchoring demand forecast to the most recent regime, I set L via overall observed lead times (let backend compute average from concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects weeks P39\u2013P43 (demands: 50,51,47,74,29 \u2192 stable moderate level ~50) scaled by (1+L). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices: (1) ensure OR backend uses the empirically observed lead-time mix, (2) keep forecast tied to the latest demand regime to avoid over-ordering given large pipeline, and (3) reduce service-level inflation from older high-demand spikes.

Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 in multiple recent observations (orders on P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39). I set L based on the last 3 observed lead times to reflect the confirmed shift to 3 periods. Demand over the most recent 6 concluded periods (Periods 39\u201344 = 50,51,47,74,29,49) averages \u224850; I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stocking for the current recent demand regime and avoids overreacting to older volatile spikes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand (Periods 39-45) averages \u224848.14 units/week after the large replenishment; no new sustained changepoint or lost-shipment evidence since Period 36 (lead time confirmed as 3). On-hand=1, in-transit=579 (large pipeline). I set lead time explicitly to 3 (observed recent actual). Forecast (mu_hat) uses explicit (1+L=4)\xd7recent mean \u2248192.57 to cover review+lead period demand given L=3; this keeps service while pipeline is large. Volatility (sigma_hat) uses recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent demand variability over the last 7 concluded periods (Periods 39-45). These parameters prioritize fulfilling demand spikes while recognizing high in-transit inventory to avoid excessive additional ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Recent weekly demand (Periods 40-46) averaged ~46 units/week with moderate variability; holiday season just passed and demand has normalized. On-hand=0, in-transit=579 \u2014 pipeline is large but includes overdue shipments (no arrivals in Period 46). Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift to 3 periods (confirmed P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=7) to capture the last 7 weeks' stabilized post-peak demand (keeps forecast responsive to the recent ~46/week level). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating (or understating) inventory given long actual lead time and recent demand regime, and help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: order on Period 34 (297 units) has not arrived by Period 46 (overdue beyond observed LT=3), likely lost.
