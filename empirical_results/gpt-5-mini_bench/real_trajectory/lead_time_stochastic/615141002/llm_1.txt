Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=590 units which comfortably covers the next 3 periods even allowing some variability or delay. Lead-time/loss: historical lead time has varied (1\u20132) and some past lost shipments, but current in-transit quantity is ample. Decision: do not order to avoid high holding cost (holding cost = profit per unit), rely on in-transit inventory to meet demand.",
