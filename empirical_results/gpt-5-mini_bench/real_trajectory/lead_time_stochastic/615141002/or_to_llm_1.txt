Risk checks: actual lead time has varied historically (observed 1\u20133), and some shipments were delayed/lost earlier, but the visible pipeline of 191 plus on-hand 80 includes recent arrivals confirmed in Period 45 conclude; therefore we have sufficient buffer even if an in-transit shipment is delayed. Holding cost equals profit ($1 vs $1), so excess inventory is costly; avoid ordering to reduce holding cost. Decision: order 0 units.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded arrivals through Period 46 show mixed lead times (1\u20133), but recent arrivals (Periods 41 and 45) arrived within 1\u20133 periods; no new confirmed persistent change to promised L=2. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=49 + in-transit=191 => pipeline inventory =240 units. Required coverage = (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Recent demand history (Periods 41\u201346 = 66,231,62,45,68,31) is noisy; excluding the single large spike (231, likely event-driven), a reasonable short-run mean \u2248 56\u201368 units/week. Using a conservative mean ~75 units yields 3-period demand \u2248225 units. OR recommended 35 units, but given current pipeline (240) already covers ~3 periods and holding cost equals profit ($1), additional units risk negative marginal value. Strategy: place zero order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs while monitoring concluded arrivals next periods to confirm any delayed/lost shipments and actual lead-time persistence. If arrivals fail to materialize, resume ordering in subsequent periods to restore coverage.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Inventory (49 on-hand + 191 in-transit = 240) already covers ~3 periods of expected demand (~225); holding cost equals profit, so I defer ordering (0) to avoid excess inventory unless future concludes show lost shipments.",
