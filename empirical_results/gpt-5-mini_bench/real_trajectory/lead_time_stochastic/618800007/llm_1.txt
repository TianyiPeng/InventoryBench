Supplier promised lead time = 2 periods. With promised L=2, an order placed now will only arrive in Period 3; current on-hand=0 so we cannot satisfy Period 1 demand regardless. Planning horizon must cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand (current week + 2 future weeks). Given calendar uplift risk around Feb 14, target slightly above mean. Avoid excessive overstock because holding cost = $1/unit/period equals unit profit, so keep order conservative but sufficient to cover expected demand when stock arrives. Decision: order 200 units (\u22483\xd764=192 rounded up to 200) to meet demand when the shipment arrives and to allow modest upside for Valentine's demand while limiting holding exposure.",

A reasonable short-term demand forecast = ~80\u2013100 units/week, but high variance. Lead time & arrivals: Promised lead time=2. We have 200 units in-transit from Period1 order; per game timing that shipment is scheduled to arrive during Period3 (would cover Period3 demand) but the arrival is not visible to us until Period4 conclude.

  "rationale": "Calendar/world: Period date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) but recent weekly demand is very low (no holiday spike observed). Demand analysis: last 7 periods (P39\u2013P45) demand = [15,18,12,31,10,6,8], avg \u224814.3/week \u2014 far below earlier regimes.

Inventory risk: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1/period => carrying inventory more than one period yields no net gain unless sold immediately. Given low current demand and high uncertainty in arrivals (some in-transit likely never arrive), placing new stock risks incurring holding cost without compensating sales. Action: do not order this period and avoid creating inventory holding exposure; rely on any eventual arrivals in-transit to cover small near-term demand.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end). No product-specific holiday spike is evident in history. Demand regime: recent weekly demand has been very low (Periods 32\u201346 mostly single- to low-double digits; last six weeks: 31,10,6,8,5). Supplier/pipeline: on-hand=0 but in-transit=340 (matches two long-outstanding shipments P1=200 and P10=140 which have been missing for many periods). Supplier deliveries are inconsistent (some 1\u20133 period arrivals, some shipments appear indefinitely delayed); no new confirmed change this period. Financials: profit=$1/unit and holding cost=$1/unit/period \u2014 carrying inventory yields no net benefit unless it turns into immediate sales. Action logic: given very low current demand, large uncertain in-transit balance (340) and high holding cost equal to profit, placing new orders risks incurring holding losses if inventory arrives before being sold. With unreliable lead times and significant outstanding in-transit stock, the conservative decision is to place no new order this period.",
