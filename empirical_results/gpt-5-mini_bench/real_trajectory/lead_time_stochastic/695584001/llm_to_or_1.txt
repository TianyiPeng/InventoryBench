Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show recent nonzero demand (37,61,109) after two zero weeks; no sustained regime of 3+ periods confirmed yet. Promised lead time is 2. I use default lead time and default demand moment estimates so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=3 to set base-stock while avoiding overfitting to the short recent spike. This balances service (capture recent uptick) against holding cost given current zero inventory and no observed arrivals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=117 (ordered P1) and no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed; promised L=2 retained. Historical weekly samples show a recent upward demand trend (samples: 0,0,37,61,109) and Period 1 demand=63\u2014I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the upward regime. Set L to default (promised 2). Use mu_hat with recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the five most recent samples (multiplied by 1+L by backend). Keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (captures recent demand rise) vs holding cost; current in-transit (117) is slightly below the (1+L)-period recent mean, so OR backend will likely top up.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed weekly demand samples show an upward trend (historic samples: 0,0,37,61,109). On-hand=0, in-transit=240 (orders from P1/P2). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred; use promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). To capture the recent upward demand while still smoothing noise, use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.5 so recent higher weeks get moderate weight; backend will scale by (1+L). Use default sigma_hat to reflect overall sample variability (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances higher service level for rising demand while letting the OR engine account for observed variability and the pipeline of 240 units to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded history shows three consecutive orders (placed P1,P2,P3) with arrived=0 \u2014 orders placed in Period1 would have been expected to conclude by Period3 if promised L=2 held. This indicates actual lead time is longer than promised or shipments are lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=360. To be conservative and cover demand during the longer unseen transit, I set L explicitly to 3 (one period longer than promised). Demand history (2019-01 series: 0,0,37,61,109) yields a weekly mean ~41.4; I'll let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full-sample defaults scaled by (1+L). Using defaults keeps the engine's statistical estimates while the explicit longer L mitigates stockout risk given missing arrivals. This balances higher service level (protects sales/profit) against holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time anomaly: orders placed on Periods 1-3 did not arrive by Period 3 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 evidence that actual lead time >2 or shipments lost; treat as sustained until contradicted.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
695584001: ordered=0, arrived=123 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=123, demand=57, sold=57, ending on-hand inventory=66
Daily Profit: $1083.00, Daily Holding Cost: $66.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1017.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (Periods 1-4) shows higher and consistent weekly demand (63,90,60,57; mean=67.5) vs older sparse samples, indicating a regime of elevated demand. Pipeline: on-hand=66, in-transit=237 (likely P1 and P3 orders). Concluded arrival from Period 2 (ordered P2 arrived P4) gives observed lead_time=2; missing arrivals from P1/P3 may be delayed/lost but not yet conclusive. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times rather than promised; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=4 to focus the forecast on the latest evident demand regime. This balances service (raise base stock to meet recent ~67/week demand) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples; keeping sigma based on recent variability tempers safety stock given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Inventory: on-hand=18, in-transit=237 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand covers several periods of demand. History shows one confirmed observed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and earlier missing arrivals that were partly resolved; therefore use observed-average lead time. Recent demand (Periods1-5 = 63,90,60,57,48) suggests a stable ~64 units/week; using the last 5 samples captures the current regime. Set L by calculation to reflect observed lead time=2; set mu_hat using recent_N over last 5 periods to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean (=3\xd763.6\u2248190.8) to cover review+lead demand; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices balance service (covering 3 periods of ~64 avg demand) against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost ratio.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand (Periods 4-6 = 57, 48, 59) averages ~54.7/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (large pipeline from prior orders). Past conclude messages show a lead-time anomaly earlier but lead time confirmed=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). To balance service vs holding cost I keep promised lead time (default=2) and use a recent_N forecast (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the most recent lower demand regime and avoids over-ordering given the large in-transit stock and low holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (matches outstanding orders from Periods 1 & 3). Recent realized lead-time evidence: Period2 order arrived in Period4 (lead time=2) so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (Periods 4-7 = 57,48,59,74) shows a recent regime around ~60/wk; I use a recent_N forecast to capture this short-run level and avoid overweighting earlier low samples. Setting mu_hat based on last 4 demands ((1+L)=3 times mean of 57,48,59,74 => captures near-term expected demand over review+lead), and sigma_hat based on variability of the same 4 most recent observations to reflect current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost by relying on recent demand rather than the long-ago seasonal jump.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=237. Historical demand recent run (Periods 4-8) shows sustained weekly demand ~57\u201374; I use recent data to capture current regime. Lead time observed previously equals 2 (Period2\u2192Period4), so set L by calculating observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5 = last 5 demand observations) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime; this balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding costs given ample pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-9): [57,48,59,74,68,51] -> demand settled ~60/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (matches orders from Periods 1 and 3 still outstanding) while one order (Period2) confirmed lead time=2. Evidence points to actual lead time = 2 but with some lost/stalled shipments. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 4-9 average ~57.8) and avoid diluting with earlier near-zero weeks. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts in the current higher-demand regime) while letting the OR cap control order size given uncertainty and suspected lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 1 and 3 (117 + 120 = 237 units) remain in-transit through Period 9 -> suspected lost/stalled shipments; treat as unresolved until concluded.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (apparently from Periods 1 & 3 and still unresolved). Observed lead-time evidence: Period4 conclude shows Period2 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=2). No sustained change in demand regime; recent fulfilled demand (Periods 4\u201310) = [57,48,59,74,68,51,47]. To be conservative about lead time I use calculated average of observed lead times (returns 2). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (last 7 observed-demand periods where sales occurred) to capture current level after intermittent arrivals; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to keep base-stock aligned to recent demand while acknowledging the outstanding in-transit units that may be lost: keeping L based on observed data avoids overreacting to missing shipments, and using recent demand focuses safety stock where it matters given holding cost is low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Unresolved/stalled shipments: orders from Period 1 (117) and Period 3 (120) totaling 237 units remain in-transit through Period 10 conclude; treat as suspected lost/stalled until concluded.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 units from early-period orders that remain unresolved (suspected lost/stalled). Historical concluded lead-time observations include one clear arrival (Period2\u2192Period4) indicating lead_time=2; missing arrivals from Periods 1 and 3 are unresolved. To be conservative about lead time estimation I use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses evidence-based observation rather than default promise). Demand forecast and uncertainty will use defaults so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages full historical demand while letting the backend incorporate the computed L. This balances service (using observed lead-time) against holding cost given large in-transit uncertainty and suspected lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show at least one confirmed lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) but multiple earlier orders remain unresolved\u2014risk of lost/stalled shipments. Demand recent history (Periods 1\u201312) shows consistent weekly demand (range ~47\u201390). To be responsive to the recent actual demand regime while letting the OR engine use observed lead-time evidence, I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast on the most recent 12 demand observations (captures current weekly pattern and volatility). This balances service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost by keeping parameters tied to recent demand and confirmed lead-time evidence; unresolved in-transit units are noted but may be lost, so I avoid inflating forecasts with very old ordered quantities.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=244. History shows intermittent arrivals: Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2 (confirming promised 2), while some early orders (P1,P3) remain stalled/lost\u2014treat as unresolved. I keep L as default (promised 2) because we have at least one confirmed 2-period arrival and no sustained evidence to change the promised lead time. Recent demand has declined versus initial bursts; to capture current regime I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the near-term observed demand pattern while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost by focusing forecasts on recent lower demand.

Observed concluded arrivals show lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4, P12\u2192P14); use calculated average lead time to reflect confirmed evidence. Demand history shows extended stockouts with recent low-to-moderate weekly demand; use default (all-samples) demand scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1. Do not treat the 237 in-transit as confirmed arrival until concluded; this choice keeps orders conservative while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=0, in-transit=237 (these are the suspected stalled/lost orders from early periods). Two concluded arrivals (Period4 and Period14) both imply observed lead_time=2; no new sustained demand regime detected but many historical stockouts suppress true demand. To be conservative and consistent with observed lead times, set L method to calculate (backend will average observed lead times = 2). Use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) rather than relying on recent, likely biased, stockout-affected samples. This balances service level (use confirmed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume that may be lost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent observed demand has fallen sharply vs earlier samples (recent demands P12-P16 = 49,27,22,14,8). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 which matches earlier suspected lost/stalled shipments (these remain unresolved). Concluded arrivals show two confirmed lead-time observations = 2 periods (P2->P4, P12->P14) so I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times. Demand appears to have entered a lower regime starting around Period 12; I therefore forecast using the recent regime. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (uses P12-P16 mean) to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and reduce overstating demand given low recent sales. For variability I also choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices keep target base-stock moderate (avoid heavy holding cost) while providing coverage for the 1+L review+lead window; they also avoid inflating lead time due to suspected lost shipments (we use concluded lead-time evidence only).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 13-17 demand = 27,22,14,8,12; mean \u224816.6). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 237 (these are unresolved/stalled from early orders). Observed concluded arrivals support promised lead time = 2 (Period2\u21924, Period12\u219214). To avoid overstocking against suspected lost pipeline while meeting ongoing low demand, use promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand periods to reflect the lower regime. This produces a (1+L)-scaled recent mean forecast and recent volatility for the OR engine to compute a conservative base-stock and capped order.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has fallen to low levels (Periods 13-18 demands = 27,22,14,8,12,8). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (these are older suspected/stalled shipments from Periods 1 & 3). Observed concluded lead times (Period4: P2\u2192arrived in P4; Period14: P12\u2192arrived in P14) average 2 periods. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and large in-transit pipeline, I set L by calculating the observed average lead time, and forecast demand using a recent-window mean to reflect the recent low-demand regime. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to weight the last 6 demand observations; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock conservative (lower \u03bc\u0302) to limit holding cost given large outstanding in-transit volume while the OR engine still accounts for promised lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has fallen vs earlier weeks (Periods 13-19: 27,22,14,8,12,8,18) indicating a lower-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (these include older suspected stalled shipments). Promised lead time=2 and arrivals at lead_time=2 have been observed (Period2->P4, Period12->P14), so use default promised L to let OR engine assume 2. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=7) to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 13-19) so mu_hat reflects current weekly demand multiplied by (1+L). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect reduced volatility in recent weeks. This reduces over-ordering given large uncertain in-transit volume and high holding cost relative to profit, while still covering immediate (L+1) periods of current demand.

Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=2 when shipments did arrive (Period2->P4, Period12->P14). Because promised lead time=2 matches observed arrivals and evidence of lost/stalled specific earlier orders is unresolved (in-transit exists but not concluded), use default lead time to let OR engine assume promised L=2. Demand history is sparse but no clear sustained regime change since last confirmed arrivals; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters conservative given uncertain in-transit status and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (suspected stalled/lost from early periods). Recent realized lead-times (concluded arrivals) are consistent with promised L=2 (Period2->P4, Period12->P14), so use default promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for unresolved lost shipments. Demand has risen in recent weeks (last 6 periods demands = 8,12,8,18,53,77; mean\u224829.33), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 periods to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L) scaling applied by backend). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat increases responsiveness to the uptick while keeping L conservative given mixed arrival evidence. This balances service (protects against stockouts given recent demand spike) versus holding cost by limiting the lookback to a compact recent sample rather than all-time averages.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (these are the outstanding Period1 and Period3 orders). Concluded arrivals show lead time=2 for observed arrivals (Period2\u2192Period4, Period12\u2192Period14) so I keep L as promised (default). Recent demand has risen sharply in the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 18-22 demands = 8,18,53,77,109); to capture the current higher demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=5. Volatility estimate is set from the same recent window to reflect current variance, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices raise the short-term target stock to meet elevated recent demand while using the promised lead time (concluded evidence does not support systematically changing L). I note the 237 units in-transit appear stalled/lost (unresolved) and will not be relied upon for service until concluded.

Carry-over insight: Unresolved/stalled shipments: orders from Period 1 (117 units) and Period 3 (120 units) totaling 237 units remain in-transit through Period 22 conclude (still not arrived); treat as suspected lost/stalled until concluded.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=278 with several older orders unresolved\u2014possible lost/stalled shipments but most recent concluded lead times align with promised L=2. Recent demand (Periods 21-23 = 77,109,173) shows a sustained upward regime (3 periods) so I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current higher demand. Keep L as default (promised 2) so the OR backend assumes standard lead time while our recent demand estimates raise the base-stock to cover the observed spike; sigma recent_N=3 raises safety stock to reduce stockouts given elevated variability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=479; recent demand has been high (several 100s in July: P22=109, P23=173, P24=106) indicating elevated demand regime. Historical conclude messages show consistent observed lead_time=2 (P4: P2\u2192P4, P14: P12\u2192P14) so use promised/default lead time. Several early orders remain stalled/in-transit (237 units from P1/P3) but multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals justify using default lead time rather than extending L. To balance service level vs holding cost, use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine increases replenishment for the recent high demand while capping orders via its internal cap to limit over-ordering given suspected lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Recent demand has jumped since Period 20 (periods 20-25 demands = 53,77,109,173,106,68) indicating a new higher-demand regime starting ~Period 21. Some earlier orders were lost/stalled but we have two confirmed 2-period arrivals (P2->P4, P12->P14), so use observed lead-time evidence. Set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (confirmed=2). For demand, use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (covers Periods 20-25). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend target to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior; they also avoid over-relying on stale low-demand samples and help reduce stockouts given large in-transit quantity and suspected lost shipments.

To balance service vs holding cost: set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the small upward shift in observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to base the forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime (last 7 weeks) so the OR backend orders enough to cover the elevated demand over the review+lead period while controlling excess inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime shifted up beginning Period 22 (demands: P22=109, P23=173, P24=106, P25=68, P26=87, P27=91) \u2014 use recent data to capture this higher mean. Lead-time observations from concluded arrivals: P4 (order P2 -> 2), P14 (order P12 -> 2), P26 (order P23 -> 3) => recent average ~2.33. Many older orders appear stalled/lost but unresolved; backend won't see lost shipments, so raise effective L to reflect observed slower arrival (use recent average) and compute mu_hat/sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime (N=6) to ensure pipeline covers (1+L) periods of demand and avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1 favors service).

Observed concluded lead times: Period2\u2192P4 (2), Period12\u2192P14 (2), Period23\u2192P26 (3) \u2014 variable but measurable; use averaged observed lead time. Recent demand regime shifted up from ~Period21 (demands: 173,106,68,87,91,88) so set demand forecast using the 6 most recent samples to capture the higher mean and volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to cover the elevated recent demand while using empirical lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals and suspected lost shipments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (includes earlier suspected stalled/lost shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3} with recent variability; use recent_N N=3 to estimate L (captures the 3 most recent observed lead times). Demand shows a clear upward regime since ~Period 21 (demands: 53,77,109,173,106,68,87,91,88,89); use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent sustained high-demand window. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while using a short recent lead-time window to reflect observed drift (2\u20133 periods) and help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=438 with multiple long-outstanding in-transit batches (some orders from early periods never concluded) \u2014 evidence of lost/stalled shipments but recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times >2 at times (observed lead_times = 2,2,3). I choose L.method = "calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures realized drift > promised 2). Demand is volatile but no recent sustained regime shift beyond the historical sample set, so use mu_hat.method = "default" and sigma_hat.method = "default" so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), balancing service level vs holding cost given higher inferred lead time. This approach hedges against longer effective lead time while avoiding overfitting to transient demand spikes.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3} (periods 4,14,26 arrivals), so I let the backend infer an empirical lead time average (calculate) rather than blindly trusting promised 2. Demand recently elevated in summer; I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=8) to capture the most recent regime while avoiding overfit to single spikes. Sigma left as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (use observed lead-time avg and recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and known occasional shipment delays.

Recent history shows intermittent confirmed lead times of 2 (P2->P4, P12->P14) and one 3-period event (P23->P26); multiple earlier orders remain/stalled but in-transit=438 currently. On-hand=0 so pipeline is critical. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use observed lead-time average (captures mixed 2/3 signals). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so demand forecast uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given large in-transit volume and variable demand spikes. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given heavy pipeline exposure.

Recent demand (most recent 5 concluded weeks P29-P33): [89,71,58,55,71], mean \u2248 68.8; demand appears elevated vs early-year low and shows summer peak. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the 2\u20133 period reality). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher summer/early-fall regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting current elevated demand while recognizing slightly longer actual lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 2 and 3 period observations).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (several past shipments long overdue in history). Observed concluded lead times: 2, 2, 3 \u2192 use historical average via 'calculate' so backend infers average observable lead time. Demand history is noisy with recent high summer spikes but no clear sustained shift since those spikes; use default demand/volatility estimators so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on full sample set. This balances service (uses observed average lead time) versus holding cost (defaults avoid overreacting to possibly lost/stalled in-transit quantities). No explicit adjustment to mu/sigma to avoid amplifying noise from suspected lost shipments.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 \u2014 sizable pipeline but many past shipments were delayed/lost. Observed concluded lead-times: 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P12->P14), 3 (P23->P26) -> average ~2.33 so use calculate to let backend set L\u22482.33. Demand has clearly shifted upward and remained elevated since late July (periods ~24+); use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the new regime. I choose N=12 (most recent 12 concluded demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock and uncertainty reflect current higher demand while the backend caps orders; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large outstanding pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been elevated (weeks 31-37: 58,55,71,69,60,83,97) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=438 (contains earlier suspected stalled shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3}; to be responsive to recent variability I set L to recent_N over last 3 observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 7 demand samples to capture the current higher-demand regime while avoiding old zero-demand periods. Sigma uses the same recent 7-sample window to reflect current volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand but keep cap restraint via the OR engine to limit excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,3} (orders from P2,P12,P23), indicating occasional 3-period delay but center ~2. Several earlier shipments remained unresolved but recent concluded arrivals support ~2 periods on average. To let the OR backend infer lead time from observed data and retain its demand-statistics defaulting, I choose: L=calculate (use avg observed lead times), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This instructs the optimizer to incorporate the empirical lead-time average while using full-sample demand mean/volatility so the base-stock balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost given the sizable in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 with a history of intermittent arrivals and several suspected lost/stalled shipments; observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3} (from past arrivals). Demand has been volatile but no clear recent upward regime shift. To balance service and holding cost I use the calculated average lead time to reflect mixed evidence, and keep mu_hat/sigma_hat at defaults so the OR engine uses full-sample demand statistics scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to stalled/ lost orders while letting the backend compute safety stock from overall demand variability.

Concluded lead-time observations: observed lead times = 2 (P4), 2 (P14), 3 (P26) \u2192 average \u22482.33. To account for observed variability I set L via 'calculate' so backend uses average of concluded lead times. Demand has many weekly samples across the season; I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using observed slightly >2 lead) while avoiding manual overforecasting given large in-transit volume and past lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical concluded lead times = {2,2,3} (orders concluded in Periods 4,14,26); recent observed average lead time \u22482.33 so I set L using recent_N=3 to capture this. Demand has been elevated and variable in recent months (many weeks with 55\u2013109 units); I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime. Volatility should reflect the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N=20. These settings steer the OR engine to cover (L+1) periods of recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding overcommitment given past delayed/lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 with a history of mixed arrivals: observed concluded lead times = 2,2,3 (orders placed P2->arrive P4, P12->P14, P23->P26). Several earlier shipments remain unresolved in-transit; risk of lost/stalled shipments persists. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures 2,2,3 -> ~2.33). Demand has a clear regime shift starting around Period 23 (large spike and consistently higher weekly demand through Period 42); I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to base forecasts and volatility on the post-spike regime (covers Periods 23\u201342). These choices help the OR engine raise target base_stock and safety stock to meet the higher recent demand while letting the backend account for averaged lead time uncertainty.

To be responsive to recent lead-time variation I set L using recent_N (N=3). Forecast demand over review+lead using recent 12 weeks to capture recent downward seasonal trend: mu_hat recent_N N=12. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. No new evidence that stalled in-transit 237 units resolved; parameters chosen to avoid over-ordering while covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand.

Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures occasional 3-period arrival). Recent demand has been lower since autumn (last ~12 periods show reduced weekly demand vs mid\u2010year spikes), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest regime and avoid overreacting to summer spikes. These parameters bias orders toward current low-demand reality while acknowledging slightly elevated lead-time risk from observed variability.

I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time regime (avg \u22482.33) while acknowledging variability and occasional 3-period delays.

Demand in recent weeks is low (last 5 demands: 55,17,10,32,17) reflecting post-holiday softening. To balance service vs. holding cost I estimate lead time from the most recent observed samples (capture slight >2 mean) and forecast demand using the last 5 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime; volatility likewise from the last 5 to avoid overstocking. These settings keep orders responsive to current low demand while recognizing lead-time variability from recent concludes and the large in-transit position.
