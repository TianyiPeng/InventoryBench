Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed. Historical weekly demand samples available (59,14,28,85,85) with no clear recent regime shift or seasonal event around this date. No lead-time evidence contradicting the promised 2-period lead time. To avoid overfitting on limited data and because shipments may still be in-transit (no conclude messages), use default methods so the OR engine computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance with promised lead time. This balances service level (cover current + lead periods) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent realized demand shows a sustained uptick (85 on 2019-01-28, 85 on 2019-02-04, 91 in Period1) vs earlier samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=108 (ordered Period1) and promised L=2 but no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unknown. To respond to the apparent regime shift while respecting lead-time uncertainty, I keep L as default (promised) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the three most recent high-demand periods. This raises the base-stock to cover the new higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures the increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-28: recent avg (2019-01-28,2019-02-04,2019-02-11)=87 vs historical avg=54.2 (+60%)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-28: recent 3-week avg \u224887 vs historical avg \u224854 (+60%). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 units (covers multiple periods of elevated demand but some prior orders have not concluded yet). Promised lead time remains plausible (no concluded arrivals yet), so keep L = default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to meet the sustained higher demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost = $1 vs profit = $4.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=306 (orders placed P1-P3). Historical concluded messages show zero arrivals for periods where orders promised L=2 should have arrived \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Demand regime shift noted starting 2019-01-28 (higher recent mean). To hedge missing arrivals I increase assumed lead time slightly to allow the OR engine to plan for longer pipeline; I keep demand forecast focused on the confirmed recent regime (use last 3 samples: 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04, 2019-02-11). Volatility set from same recent window. These choices aim to raise target pipeline to cover higher recent demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total ordered=306) did not arrive by their promised lead time (L=2); treat as delayed/lost until further arrival evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand elevated vs earlier historical baseline (regime shift identified starting 2019-01-28). On-hand=30, in-transit=336; several earlier orders (Periods 1\u20133) did not conclude on time but Period 2 order concluded with lead_time=2, so treat lead time as observed=2 when averaging. Choose L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the recent higher-demand regime while keeping smoothing across the most recent five demand observations. This biases base_stock upward to improve service given high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) while keeping variance estimation recent for safety. 

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, observed: ordered on Period 2, arrived Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand elevated and variable: last 3 concluded demands = [111, 63, 92], avg \u2248 88.7 (higher than older long-run mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=336 (covers multiple periods but prior shipments were delayed then partially confirmed; latest concluded arrivals confirm promised L=2). I therefore keep L at the promised/default 2, set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new higher regime (N=3), and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service given observed demand spike while sigma captures dispersion so the capped order cap limits excessive ordering given holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted up: last 6 demands = [91,110,111,63,92,109] (mean ~96). On-hand=0, in-transit=336 (these are prior orders; some arrivals confirmed at L=2). I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (observed arrival: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 => LT=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the last 6 demands (captures the recent higher regime and includes review+lead coverage). For volatility I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given sustained elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data yields appropriate safety stock; using calculate L avoids relying solely on promised LT given past delays.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=336. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = promised 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Recent demand has risen (most recent weekly demands: 63, 92, 109, 122 plus earlier 111,110,91) \u2014 a higher regime is evident. Reconcile: large in-transit (336) will cover several upcoming periods but may include delayed shipments; maintain promised L to keep OR backend assumptions aligned with observed confirmed lead time. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (reducing influence of older low-demand weeks) while using default lead time so the backend uses the promised 2-period review. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand has shifted upward since 2019-01-28 (recent weeks much higher than historical pre-shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=336 (covers some upcoming demand). Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent demand (last 8 periods) for forecast and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the new higher demand while relying on promised L=2. Recent_N=8 chosen because we have 8 recent demand observations since the detected regime shift.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Recent demand has been elevated (last several weeks: 92,109,122,149,87 plus earlier 63,111) suggesting a sustained higher-demand regime vs historical 2019-Jan samples. Promised lead time=2 is consistent with observed concluded lead times. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility while using the promised L, I set L=default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (use the last 7 demand observations) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, which raises the base-stock to meet higher short-term demand but keeps volatility grounded in recent variation. This balances higher service level need (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost, leveraging the large in-transit quantity to limit excessive new orders.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=336. Historical concluded lead times: observed W=2 (P2\u2192P4) and W=1 (P9\u2192P10) so recent evidence shows variability around promised L=2. Demand has been elevated since the regime shift starting 2019-01-28 (carry-over notes): recent periods show consistently higher weekly demand than earlier baseline. To balance service vs holding cost: set L method to average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period reality). For demand, use a recent_N estimate to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (more weight on recent higher demand). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. Chosen N=8 (captures the recent regime length while \u22653 and \u226420). These parameters will raise base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using observed lead-time variability to avoid over-ordering given pipeline=336.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=342. History shows intermittent arrivals: observed lead times = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P9\u2192P10), and multiple earlier promised arrivals were delayed/missing. I let the backend infer L via 'calculate' (average observed lead times) to reflect this variability. Demand appears to have shifted higher since 2019-01-28 (carry-over insight already recorded); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the last 6 demand observations (balances responsiveness vs sample size). These parameters bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the OR engine will cap by its safety-cap formula, mitigating excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=367. Observed concluded lead times: two arrivals show LT=2 (P4) and LT=1 (P10) \u2014 recent variability but no sustained change beyond these two samples. Demand has shifted to a higher regime; recent 6 periods (P7\u2013P12) average demand ~109.7. To balance service and holding cost I set L based on recent observed Ls (captures recent LT shortening), and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping volatility responsive to recent swings. This increases target base-stock to reduce lost sales given substantial in-transit and recent high demand, while sigma_hat recent_N lets the OR cap limit excessive orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Recent arrivals show observed lead times = {P4:2, P10:1, P13:2} (last 3 observed LT = [2,1,2]). Demand has been elevated since 2019-01-28; recent demand (last 5 periods: P9-P13) = [87,65,116,119,119]. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the mixed but short actual lead-times (avg ~1.67) rather than blindly using promised=2. For demand and volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed higher recent mean and variance; the OR backend will scale (1+L) internally. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping cap constraints informed by recent volatility, balancing service level (profit per unit $4) against holding cost ($1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile vs. historical (recent weeks: 149,87,65,116,119,119,171 \u2014 sustained higher tail since late Jan). On-hand=0, in-transit=341 (large pipeline that may cover multiple periods). Observed concluded lead times: 2,1,2,2 \u2192 average ~1.75, confirming typical lead_time\u22482 with occasional 1. To be robust to the recent higher-demand regime, set L by calculating average observed lead times and set demand parameters using a recent-window estimate (captures current elevated mean/volatility). This keeps service high during sustained elevated demand while the large in-transit inventory limits immediate ordering.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (multiple weeks >100 units including 149,171,137). On-hand=0, in-transit=404 \u2014 sufficient pipeline but some prior shipments showed mixed lead times (observed = 2,1,2,2). I choose to let backend infer average observed lead time (calculate) to capture slight variation. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=12) to weight the pronounced higher recent weekly demand; sigma also recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias base stock upward to avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time averaging to avoid over-ordering if some shipments are faster.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been consistently high (Periods 8-16: 149,87,65,116,119,119,171,137,160) \u2014 sustained elevated regime vs earlier history. On-hand=0, in-transit=404 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P10:1, P13:2, P14:2} -> average ~1.75, so use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent data to capture the current high-demand regime (use last N=10 periods to reflect recent shift) so the OR engine increases target base-stock and accounts for recent volatility while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been elevated vs early-history (regime shift starting 2019-01-28); last 7 observed weekly demands = [116,119,119,171,137,160,129] (mean \u2248136.7), so I forecast using the recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline) \u2014 recent arrivals show actual lead time \u22482 most periods (one 1-period outlier). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (uses all concluded arrivals) to capture the slight variability around 2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and to avoid diluting with older lower-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat to meet elevated demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=440 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible arrivals yet this period. Recent demand has been higher vs. early history (sustained regime since 2019-01-28) and last 10 demands (Periods 9\u201318) reflect current regime. Lead-time observations (multiple concluded arrivals) average near 2 periods. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (captures slight deviations from promised L=2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit and elevated recent demand).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline). Recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,2,2,1] \u2192 average ~1.67; use calculated average to reflect mixed 1\u20132 observations. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-28 (sustained elevated weekly demand); recent demand (last 6 periods P14\u2013P19 = 171,137,160,129,117,101) mean\u2248135.8 and std captures current volatility. Set L via calculate to use observed lead-time history; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to focus the (1+L)\xd7forecast on the current high-demand regime and to keep safety stock responsive while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1/unit. This balances service level (protecting against recent high weekly demand) against holding cost and large existing in-transit pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=446 \u2014 sizable pipeline but no on-hand stock. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods); some earlier missing shipments were later confirmed arriving with L=2. Demand context: historical sample mean=54.2 but recent periods show elevated weekly demand (multiple 100+ weeks). To let the OR engine infer current effective lead time from observed arrivals, set L=calculate (average observed lead times). Use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples; this is conservative given limited formal changepoint confirmation and avoids over-reacting to volatile recent weeks while pipeline is large. This balances service (recognize longer effective L if present) vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Demand history shows the previously recorded regime shift (higher mean since 2019-01-28) but no new sustained change; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

To adapt to the recent lower/variable regime while keeping service, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend focuses on the last 5 weeks of realized demand and reduces influence of older spring spikes. This balances service (capture recent demand) vs holding cost (avoid overstock given existing large in-transit).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been variable (ranges ~40\u2013160) with an earlier sustained regime shift in late Jan noted in carry-over, but no new 3+ period sustained change since. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple review+lead periods (L+1). Several past shipments showed 1\u20132 period actual lead times; no new persistent lead-time deviation observed. To avoid overreacting to recent variability and because pipeline is already large, use default lead time and default demand moments (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). This keeps orders driven by long-run stats, preventing excess safety stock while letting the large in-transit position deplete before triggering aggressive reorders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Recent concluded lead times (periods with arrivals) = [2,1,2,2,2,1,2] (avg \u22481.71). Recent demand (last 7 concluded periods) = [101,60,57,77,43,82,75] (mean \u224872.9). Given mixed 1\u20132 period observations but a multi-period average ~1.7, I use a recent_N estimate for L to reflect observed lead-time behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 demand samples to capture the current lower summer demand regime; this keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while the large in-transit (358) reduces urgent ordering pressure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 substantial pipeline stock. Recent demand (last 6 concluded periods) = [57,77,43,82,75,28], showing a lower summer regime vs earlier spring peaks. No new sustained lead-time shift since lead time was previously confirmed as 2. I set L to default (promised 2) so OR uses contractual lead time. I select recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the recent summer demand regime and reduce ordering given large in-transit; this balances service vs holding cost by lowering forecasted (1+L)-period demand and measured volatility to avoid over-ordering while pipeline clears.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Historical observed lead times are mixed (mostly 2, some 1); average of observed lead times ~1.7 \u2014 use calculate to let backend use observed average. Recent demand (Periods 21-27 = 57,77,43,82,75,28,29) better reflects current regime (mean ~57) so use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the latest demand pattern. This keeps inventory aligned with current lower demand while the calculated L captures the mildly under-2 realized lead time pattern; using recent estimates reduces excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demand has been low and variable (last five demands: 82,75,28,29,19). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 ample pipeline but prior history shows intermittent delayed/lost shipments; no new late-arrival pattern since Period 22 arrivals consistent. I use promised lead time (default) because recent concluded arrivals support L=2. To reflect the current low recent demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 weeks July-August). This reduces target base-stock versus historical averages and limits overordering given large in-transit inventory, while recent_N sigma captures current volatility for safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals with some 1-periods; use observed average. Recent demand has settled low (last 4 weeks: 28,29,19,21 \u2192 mean\u224824.25) versus earlier high-season spikes\u2014use a recent-N forecast to capture the new low regime and recent volatility. Parameters chosen: L by calculate to reflect observed mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to target (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent stable regime, reducing overstock risk given large in-transit balance and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Recent actual arrivals have shown lead_time \u22481\u20132 but previously confirmed as 2; use promised lead time. Recent demand has dropped markedly over the last 5 periods (Periods 26\u201330), so I use a recent-window forecast. L: use default (promised L=2) to keep OR engine alignment with supplier promise. mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (covers the 5 most recent periods). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility in that same recent regime. This keeps in-transit inventory visible to backend while reducing target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given sustained low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26 (2019-08-05): avg Periods26-30 = 23.0 vs prior Periods15-25 = 94.36 (\u221276%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (2019-08-05): Periods26-31 demands = [28,29,19,21,16,21], recent mean \u224822.33 vs prior higher regime (~94), so I treat the low-demand regime as current. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (sizable pipeline). Promised lead time remains 2 and prior concluded messages confirmed L=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); no sustained evidence of a lead-time change. I set L to default (promised=2). To reflect the sustained drop in demand, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=6 (the detected recent regime length, capped between 3 and 20). This keeps the OR backend focused on current low demand while the large in-transit quantity will limit new orders via the capped policy, balancing service level vs holding cost.

No new confirmed lead-time changes; historical concluded arrivals support promised L=2.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (weeks 2019-08-05 onward); recent realized weekly demand (Periods 26-33) is much lower than earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (many earlier orders still in pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) but recent evidence confirms typical 2-period arrivals; I choose to let backend compute the average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimator focusing on the confirmed low-demand regime (N=8 = periods26\u201333) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility reflect the new lower demand and reduce overstock risk while the pipeline covers upcoming weeks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 26 (2019-08-05) \u2014 recent periods 26-34 show consistently low weekly demand (mostly teens\u2013low 20s). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline); promised lead time=2. I keep L as default (use promised lead time) because concluded arrivals historically alternate 1\u20132 and last confirmed lead-time evidence supports promised value; no new sustained lead-time change. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (periods 26\u201334) to reflect the persistent lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking given large in-transit pipeline and positive holding cost. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=9 to capture volatility in the recent low-demand regime. These choices reduce target base stock to match the new lower demand level and prevent excess holding given 358 units already in transit.

For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (periods 26-35) to capture the new low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent demand variability. This keeps orders small (backend base_stock computed from recent low mean) and avoids excess holding given high in-transit inventory and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 26 (avg ~23), so forecast should use the recent low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 which already covers multiple periods; promised lead time is 2 so keep L as default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (N=11 periods, Periods 26-36) so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand under the current regime and avoids overstock given high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime is the low regime beginning 2019-08-05 (Periods 26+). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline but history shows some delayed/lost shipments earlier; nevertheless no new lead-time evidence since Period 22 arrivals). To align forecasting with the current low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (12 periods: Periods 26\u201337). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded arrivals are still consistent with promised behavior overall and no new sustained lead-time change is observed. Using recent demand reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given holding>profit sensitivity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (sustained lower weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (sizable pipeline). No new conclusive lead-time change; promised L=2 remains appropriate. I set L to default (promised). Demand forecast uses recent data to reflect the lower regime: (1+L)-period demand estimated from recent N=8 weeks (Periods 31-38) to capture the post-changepoint mean (~30.25/week) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=8. Volatility also set from the same recent window to reflect current variability (sigma_hat recent_N N=8). This keeps orders responsive to the sustained lower demand while the large in-transit stock limits new order quantities to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime is the low-demand regime starting Period 26 (sustained lower weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current low demand so we should use demand estimates from the recent low-demand regime and let backend infer lead time from observed history. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (mixed 1\u20132, average ~2). Use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 26\u201339) so base-stock and safety stock are scaled to current lower mean and variance, avoiding excess holding cost while keeping service. No new unusual shipment losses detected beyond previously recorded patterns.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 26 (many weeks with demands ~16\u201336, occasional higher spike 52). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Promised lead time=2; prior evidence confirmed L=2 earlier. To avoid overstock given low recent demand, set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N=15 covering Periods 26\u201340). Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and safety stock to current lower mean and volatility. Keep L as default (promised) because recent concluded arrivals support 2-period lead time and no new sustained lead-time shift is observed.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the low regime that began Period 26 (many consecutive weeks of ~16\u201336 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 likely includes delayed/lost stock but recent concluded arrivals show lead times of 1\u20132 periods intermittently, so keep promised lead time. To forecast, use recent_N over the low-demand regime (Periods26\u201341, length=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sets base_stock appropriate to the sustained lower demand while L remains default. This also prevents over-ordering against the large in-transit that may never conclude.

No new sustained lead-time or demand shifts since prior insights. Choose L=default (promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=17 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (periods26-42) so orders match current demand and avoid excess holding cost given high pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline that likely covers several weeks). Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2. To avoid overstocking while matching the new low-demand regime, set L to default (promised 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend reduces target base-stock accordingly.

On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline). No new evidence of lost shipments. Set L by calculating observed lead times to let backend use actual observations. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the low-demand regime to reflect the sustained lower mean/variance (regime length = 19 periods); this reduces overordering given the large in-transit and higher holding cost tradeoff.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent months (Period 26 onward) show a persistent lower-demand regime vs early 2019; last 20 periods capture the current low-volatility regime (with one recent spike P45=76). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks even if demand spikes. Promised lead time remains 2 and historical concluded arrivals mostly support L=2, so use default promised L to keep backend assumptions aligned. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (N chosen = min(regime_length,20), regime_length \u224820). This downweights earlier high-demand months and prevents over-ordering given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Promised lead time=2. Recent weeks show a late-December demand spike (Periods 45-46: 76,97) after many low weeks; this suggests demand has risen sharply in the immediate horizon. I keep L=default (promised=2) because concluded arrivals historically support L\u22482 and there is no new sustained lead-time evidence. To prioritize service during the apparent holiday spike I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.7) to weight recent high demand more heavily while avoiding overreacting to a single week. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture increased short-term variability around the recent spike. These choices raise the target base-stock to reduce stockouts in the short term while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock.
