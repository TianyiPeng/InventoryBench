OR baseline (which uses promised L=2 and full history) recommends ordering 461. Decision logic: With L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand after ordering. Using OR's base-stock cap gives a large recommended order (461) reflecting the elevated demand estimate and service-level cap; given one very large recent demand (506) but only a single-period signal, it is not yet a sustained regime shift (insufficient evidence to record a carry-over insight). Risk trade-offs: Under-ordering risks large lost sales (high profit $19/unit), while holding cost is low ($1/unit/period).

Inventory position: on-hand 0, in-transit 798 \u2014 if those in-transit arrive they largely cover upcoming demand; if they are lost/delayed we face shortages. Cost tradeoff: profit $19 >> holding $1, so the penalty for under-ordering (lost profit) is much larger than modest holding costs. Given the strong OR baseline, high profit per unit, and current uncertainty about arrivals (overdue but not yet confirmed lost), I will follow the OR recommendation to replenish now (396 units) to guard against the risk of lost shipments while avoiding an excessive override.
