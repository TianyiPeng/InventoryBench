  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date 2019-02-11 \u2014 Valentine\u2019s (Feb 14) is imminent which can boost ladies apparel demand; last observed week (2019-02-04) showed a large spike (154) vs earlier weeks. Product is ladies denim (seasonally stable but can see promo/holiday uplift). b) Demand regime: historical weekly sample mean = (54,53,67,78,154) => avg=81.2; last week is a clear positive outlier suggesting a short-term uplift. Given holiday proximity, I bias forecast modestly above the 5-week mean. c) Lead time / orders: No in-transit and no concluded arrivals in history; promised lead time = 2 periods. No evidence contradicts promised LT yet. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With promised LT=2, guideline is to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period + two in-transit periods). e) Order logic: Forecast ~90 units/week (slightly above 5-week mean to capture uplift). Need ~3*90 = 270 units to cover 3 periods. Balances service level for Valentine uplift vs holding cost exposure. If actual lead time or demand regime later shows different behavior, adjust orders accordingly.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 recent demand has been low (Periods 43\u201345: 17, 27, 15), and historically late\u2010Dec shows depressed sales vs earlier high season. Demand regime: recent 9 weeks (P37\u2013P45) average \u224854 dropping to \u224820 in P43\u2013P45, so short\u2010term demand is low. Lead time & pipeline: historical arrivals show variable LT (1\u20132 periods) but no reliable faster LT; current system reports In\u2010transit=735 units (already in pipeline). Inventory assessment: On\u2010hand=0 but sizable in\u2010transit (735) likely to arrive over next 1\u20132 periods given observed variable LT; holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit sold, so excess arrivals will incur high holding costs if demand remains low. Decision logic: Do not add risk by ordering now \u2014 let existing pipeline clear and observe actual arrivals and demand next period to reassess. Order 0 units for SKU 658030001.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year) suggests no immediate large positive demand spike for womens denim; historical spikes earlier in year tied to summer. Demand analysis: Recent periods 42\u201346 show very low weekly demand (48,17,27,15,16) \u2014 average \u224823/week over 5 periods, a clear drop vs prior mid-season averages (~76/week for P34\u2013P41). Lead-time & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 735 units. Historically lead time has varied (observed 1\u20132 periods) and some orders were lost/delayed; many prior in-transit units eventually arrived but with variable delays. Inventory decision: With 735 units already in-transit and current demand regime \u224823/week, additional ordering would create large holding costs ($1/unit/period) and cut profit. Therefore place no new order this period to avoid overstock while awaiting arrivals and to let pipeline clear. Monitor concluded arrivals next periods to update lead-time inference and demand regime.",
