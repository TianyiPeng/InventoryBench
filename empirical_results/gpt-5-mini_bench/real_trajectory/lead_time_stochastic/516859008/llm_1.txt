No major holiday on 2019-02-11 that strongly changes belt demand; product is season-neutral but fashion/accessory demand can be steady-to-rising. b) Demand regime: Historical weekly sales show: 2019-01-07=13, 01-14=5, 01-21=15, 01-28=28, 02-04=31. Recent 3 weeks (01-21..02-04) average \u224824.7 units/week, clearly above the Jan 7\u201314 average (~9). I use the recent regime as the best forecast. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 2 periods. No concluded arrivals in history to contradict this; in-transit=0 and on-hand=0. Assume supplier lead time = promised (no evidence otherwise). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0 + in-transit 0.
