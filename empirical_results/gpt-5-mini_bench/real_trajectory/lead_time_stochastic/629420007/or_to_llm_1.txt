No concluded periods indicate no sustained lead-time or demand regime shift, so I follow the OR capped recommendation rather than exceed it.

Given in-transit=326 (~3\xd7 single-period mean demand \u2248100) provides substantial implicit coverage for the next (L+1)=3 periods, and holding cost ($1/unit/period) would erode profit ($4/unit) if we prematurely double-stock, I reduce ordering now to avoid unnecessary holding costs while awaiting confirmation of actual arrivals.
