Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) available. No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes and no sustained changepoint or seasonal signal. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [77,60,50,23,42], mean=50.4, std\u224818.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=84 (order placed Period 1). Promised lead time=2 and there is no concluded arrival yet (normal: order placed P1 will arrive in P3 and be visible in P4 conclude), so no evidence of lost/different lead time. I use default lead time (promised=2). Demand forecast uses all samples (no recent changepoint detected): mu_hat default \u2192 (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead period. Volatility uses default to capture observed variability across the (1+L) horizon. These conservative defaults ensure the OR backend computes a base-stock that balances the low unit profit ($1) against equal holding cost ($1) while accounting for the 3-period demand window and current pipeline inventory.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=153 but no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1 and P2 show arrived=0). Promised lead time=2; insufficient concluded evidence to change it. Historical weekly demand (through 2019-02-04) mean=50.4, but recent realized demand in P1=53 and P2=69 signals a modest upward shift. I use L=default (promised=2). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 (last three demand observations: 2019-02-04, P1, P2) to capture the recent higher mean; multiplying by (1+L)=3 yields a higher replenishment target. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance higher service level for the recent demand uptick while relying on promised lead time and observed pipeline; no strong evidence yet of lost shipments, so do not extend lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Visible history: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (84, 69, 11) have not concluded by Period 4 (arrived=0 each), indicating promised L=2 is not holding. To avoid understocking I set L explicit=3 (best estimate: actual lead time \u22653). Demand history mean=50.4/week; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This raises target base-stock to cover the longer lead time and balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >=3 periods: orders from P1 (84), P2 (69), P3 (11) showed arrived=0 in Period 4 conclude (3 consecutive missed arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=26, in-transit=133. History shows a concluded arrival in Period 4: 69 units (ordered P2) -> observed lead time = 2. Multiple earlier missed confirmations existed, but the only concluded lead-time evidence supports L=2. I choose L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to let the backend use actual observed lead-time data. For demand, I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical weekly samples (useful given limited data). This balances service vs holding given profit=$1 and holding=$1 (symmetric costs) while accounting for the inferred 2-period lead time and current pipeline of 133 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=133. Historical weekly demand samples (game history Periods 1-5) show recent demand = [53,69,29,43,45] with mean ~47.8; snapshot older samples (Jan) are similar scale but slightly higher. Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (matches confirmed LT=2). To reflect the most recent demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std are computed over the recent regime; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost, favoring median service level. This addresses prior missed arrivals by relying on concluded lead-time evidence rather than assuming lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (evidence: order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized demand has averaged moderate weekly sales (history P1\u2013P6: 53,69,29,43,45,24). On-hand=0, in-transit=144 (pipeline large relative to recent demand). Recent concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods, so use lead-time inference rather than promised. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (matches confirmed L=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to base mu_hat on the most recent 6 demand observations (captures any recent regime vs older historical samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tied to recent realized demand and confirmed lead time, avoiding over-ordering given a large in-transit pipeline and 1:1 profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=144. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (orders from P2 arrived at P4); use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. Recent demand has fallen vs early-sample; to capture current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (uses the last 5 demand samples from game history) so the (1+L) horizon reflects recent lower demand. Volatility use default to keep dispersion tied to full-sample history. These choices keep orders sized to recent demand while the calculate L protects against past lead-time misspecification and the default sigma avoids underestimating risk.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has been intermittent with several stockouts (recent demands: 43,45,24,38,30) and on-hand=0, in-transit=133. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = promised 2 periods (arrivals from P2 and P6 observed with 2-period lag). I therefore use L=default to keep promised lead time (2). With profit=holding, use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this leverages the full sample set while the confirmed lead time lets the backend size orders to cover (L+1) periods of demand and balance service level vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=135. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 2 periods (orders from P2 and P6 arrived after 2 periods); recent arrivals/losses are consistent with L=2. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history includes early high weeks and several recent mid-30s weeks; no strong sustained regime shift detected, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and substantial in-transit inventory.

I select L="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time; mu_hat="recent_N" (N=5) and sigma_hat="recent_N" (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (~30 units/week) and keep variability estimates aligned with recent demand. This balances service (protecting against stockouts given observed ~1.67 period lead time) and holding cost (avoids inflating orders using older high-demand samples).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent demand has been low-to-moderate (historical samples mean=50.4/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times show mostly 2-periods (P2->P4, P6->P8) with one 1-period outlier; use calculated lead time to let backend average observed lead times. Given substantial pipeline and symmetric profit=holding costs, use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine derives base-stock consistent with its data and the chosen L. This balances service level (use observed L) versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1} (orders from P2->P4, P6->P8, P9->P10). On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (large pipeline). Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples (leveraging full history while the large in-transit balance reduces urgent ordering). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=133. Historical concluded lead times: P4 showed 2 (order P2\u2192P4), P8 showed 2 (P6\u2192P8), P10 showed 1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2014 average \u22481.67. Multiple earlier missed arrivals resolved, so use estimated lead time = average of observed lead times to reflect slight variability around the promised 2. Demand samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb) are limited but no sustained recent demand regime shift detected; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (using an empiric average L close to promised 2) with holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory (133 units) already en route.

On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (many units en route but arrivals not yet concluded). To reflect recent actual lead-time evidence while smoothing noise, set L using recent_N over last 3 observed lead times.

Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent history shows repeated actual lead_time = 2 in concluded messages (orders from P2->arrived P4, P6->arrived P8) with one 1-period arrival (P9->P10). On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (pipeline large). I retain the promised lead time to keep OR backend aligned with contract LMS and use default demand/volatility estimates based on the full sample history so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This avoids overreacting to sparse/irregular arrivals while the large pipeline covers upcoming demand.

Prior concl. messages confirmed actual lead time = 2 in multiple periods and no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shift in recent concludes. Use default lead time (promised = 2) so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean over all samples; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat to let OR engine compute base_stock and cap.

Observed concluded lead times: 2,2,1 \u2192 average ~1.67. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical lead time average (calculate) to reflect observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given recent demand spike while leveraging all historical data and the backend's capped ordering rule against holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent realized demand has shifted up starting Period 15 (demands P15-18 = 70,72,78,52) vs earlier low winter samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (useful but arrivals not visible until next conclude). Promised lead time retained (default) since recent concluded messages confirm lead_time=2 in multiple periods and no new sustained LT change. I detect a demand regime change beginning Period 15 (4 consecutive higher-demand periods) so I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility to make the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to this higher recent demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=4 to reflect recent variability. This increases base_stock to protect service level while limiting excess holdings given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24. On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Recent demand (Periods 15-19) shows a sustained higher regime: [70,72,78,52,60] (avg ~66.4). Recent in-transit (~204) roughly covers (1+L)*recent_mean if L\u22482. Observed concluded lead times include multiple 2-period observations and one 1-period; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (N=5 equals the 5-period recent regime), so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given recent ~66/wk demand) vs holding cost by limiting forecasting to the most recent regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time confirmed as 2 periods (multiple arrivals consistent with L=2). Recent demand has shifted higher and sustained from Period 15\u219220 (demands: 70,72,78,52,60,58) vs earlier low-volume regime. To capture the new higher regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=6, covering Periods15-20). I keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded history confirms L=2. Using recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while reflecting observed variability and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times recently but one 1-period; to be robust I average the last 3 observed lead times. Demand has shifted up since early-2019 samples; I base forecast on the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 15-21: 70,72,78,52,60,58,47) to capture the higher regime for both mean and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases responsiveness to the sustained higher-demand regime while the L recent_N hedges against occasional 1-period arrivals or lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded lead times consistently observed as 2 periods (Periods 4,8 showed arrivals with lead_time=2); earlier missed arrivals appear resolved. Recent demand has stepped up since Period 19 (demands P19-P23 = 60,58,47,63,85) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher regime. I set L=default to use the promised 2-period lead time (evidence supports LT=2). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the last 5 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This biases the OR backend toward stocking for the higher recent demand while relying on actual in-transit inventory (204) to cover arrivals.

Observed concluded lead times include 2,2,1 \u2192 use backend 'calculate' to let observed average lead time drive L. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime, use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility focus on the last 10 demand observations. This balances service (capture recent demand spike) vs holding cost by using a recent-sample forecast rather than the long-run mean.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed at 2 in multiple periods (P4/P5/P6 evidence), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand has stepped up from mid-May (Periods 15\u201325) into a higher regime (periods 15\u201325: demands = 70,72,78,52,60,58,47,63,85,75,47 \u2192 avg \u2248 66). I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=11 (the recent high-demand regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and variance over the last 11 samples. This keeps base_stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while L=default preserves the backend's promised lead time assumption; using recent statistics reduces stockouts vs. using all-sample mean and avoids overreacting to older low-demand weeks.

Use calculate for L to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand estimate uses all historical samples (default) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat uses all samples (default). This balances service level using empirical lead-time while keeping demand forecast stable from full history.

Demand seed data (five weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) will be used by backend; to avoid overfitting to recent stockout-affected periods I select default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead-times (usable evidence) show mostly 2-periods with one 1-period sample; using 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times. Demand historical samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb) are limited but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the selected L. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5; keeping defaults avoids overfitting to sparse early samples while respecting inferred lead-time via calculate. Current pipeline (204) likely covers several weeks; no explicit increase to mu_hat requested.

I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (backend-aware), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples reflecting steady baseline demand, and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute variability.

History of delayed/missed arrivals earlier, but concluded arrivals (P4, P8, P10) indicate actual lead time \u22482 periods; no new sustained lead-time shift detected. I select L='default' to use the promised 2-period lead time (consistent with concluded evidence), and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service (use in-transit + forecasted pipeline) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand history shows elevated weekly demand (samples provided). Given confirmed LT=2 and no new sustained regime change in demand, use default calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples.

On-hand=0, in-transit=204 (large pipeline) \u2014 some earlier orders were delayed but later arrivals confirm L=2; no fresh evidence of lost shipments beyond earlier transient delays. Demand history shows sustained weekly demand (many weeks 2019 with values 17\u201385). I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded lead-time observations show mixed actual LT (observed W={2,2,1}), so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (weekly samples from 2019-01) is the primary forecast anchor; no strong recent regime shift is convincingly sustained. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the backend balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to noisy/partial arrival history while the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the OR cap.

Demand history (weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019 and many zero-order weeks thereafter) will be handled by backend default demand aggregation. I therefore choose L=default to keep lead-time at promised 2 periods, mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the OR engine aligned with observed lead-time confirmations and leverages its statistical base-stock computation while avoiding risky manual downweighting given intermittent arrivals and potential lost shipments. No new shipment-loss or regime-change claim is being added.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2,2,1 \u2192 average lead time ~1.67. Use L='calculate' to capture observed average rather than blindly using promised 2. Demand samples provided seed mean/variance are limited; use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasting conservative while letting OR engine apply its service-level cap; existing in-transit (204) likely covers multiple review+lead periods so orders will be moderated by the backend cap.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded lead-time observations: arrivals show lead times of 2, 2 and 1 periods (orders: P2->P4, P6->P8, P9->P10). Earlier missed arrivals were resolved by later concludes showing LT=2 most often. Demand history (weekly samples provided) shows no new sustained regime shift since data; recent weeks show variable demand but not a confirmed persistent change. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures the 1.67 avg seen), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so z*=0.5; keeping mu/sigma based on full history avoids overfitting to recent noise. Note in-transit=204 likely covers multiple periods of demand but monitor for lost shipments if concludes do not appear.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). SKU 473954008 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=204. Promised lead time = 2. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 4,8,10) support actual lead time ~2; no sustained new lead-time or demand regime shift in recent concluded history. Given profit=holding, the OR base-stock rule with default demand estimates is appropriate: use the promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). This keeps the backend's statistical forecast stable while the large in-transit quantity will be netted against orders.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 2 periods (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10); earlier missed arrivals were transient. Pipeline (204) currently provides coverage so avoid aggressive up/down adjustments. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures confirmed LT=2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'default' so the backend uses all demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost and the available pipeline.

Historical concludes show some arrivals with observed lead times (examples: P4: order from P2 lead_time=2; P8: order from P6 lead_time=2; P10: order from P9 lead_time=1). Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability and recent confirmations of ~2); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). No concluded arrivals this period to suggest a new change in demand or lead time.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (observed arrivals from earlier orders). Pipeline (204) likely covers multiple future periods; using default lead time keeps consistency with promised L=2 and confirmed observations. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) using the full sample set (conservative given limited recent ordering and many zero-order periods). This balances service level (use confirmed L=2) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical demand shows sustained weekly variability since Feb\u2013Dec; no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in the latest conclude messages. Promised lead time remains 2 periods; use default lead time so OR backend uses promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to reflect long-run weekly demand and variability given no recent regime change. This leverages the full history while the sizable in-transit pipeline reduces urgency to inflate forecasts.

Profit and holding costs are equal, so target service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0); base_stock will equal mu_hat. I set L explicitly to 2 to reflect confirmed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-sample stats across the (1+L) review+lead horizon) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) and volatility accordingly. This keeps parameters consistent with observed lead time while letting the backend calculate demand moments from full history.

For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical demand samples while the calculated L aligns ordering horizon with observed arrivals, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.
