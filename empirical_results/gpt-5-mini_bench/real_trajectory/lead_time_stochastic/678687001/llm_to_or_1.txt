Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show mean \u2248111.2 units/week. Promised lead time is 2 periods and there is no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean=111.2, no clear recent regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=138 (order placed P1 not yet concluded \u2014 single concluded message showed arrived=0; not sufficient evidence of lost shipment or lead-time change). Use default promised lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std, which balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed demand or lead-time shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=273 (sum of Period1 order 138 + Period2 order 135) \u2014 shipments have not concluded yet but are visible as in-transit; only two consecutive non-arrivals observed, so not yet a confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to avoid overreacting to possible transient delays while ensuring the OR engine sizes orders for a 3-period demand window given L=2. This balances service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost given modest observed historical demand (~111 units/week).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (periods 1-3) during game: 99, 141, 117; historical weekly sample mean=111.2. All three past orders (P1:138, P2:135, P3:95 = total 368) remain in-transit and no arrivals have been concluded, indicating promised lead time=2 has been violated. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to account for extended delivery; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing higher coverage for delayed arrivals against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1(138), P2(135), P3(95) total 368 remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals through Period 3, indicating promised lead time=2 is currently violated.

Daily Profit: $448.00, Daily Holding Cost: $23.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-11. Recent conclude shows one arrival (P2\u2192P4) with lead_time=2, while other earlier orders remain missing in-transit. I use 'calculate' for L so backend infers observed lead time from concluded arrivals (confirmed 2). For demand I use default aggregation (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical weekly samples to capture baseline demand across review+lead period; sigma_hat default to reflect observed variability. This conservative choice raises target inventory for 2-period lead while relying on full-sample stats because only 5 historical weeks are available and no sustained demand regime shift is yet confirmed. The parameters prioritize meeting demand given large in-transit uncertainty while avoiding overfitting to recent volatile shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Concluded history shows an observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); some earlier shipments were delayed but only confirmed lead-time evidence is L=2. Profit=4, Holding=1 implies high service-level (q=0.8) so keep demand estimate based on all available samples. Choose L by calculating observed lead times (uses concluded evidence). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend computes base stock and caps consistently while accounting for the confirmed lead time and all demand history.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded arrival shows order placed P2 arrived P4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2 periods; missing earlier arrivals partially resolved. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times (supports confirmed L=2). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a stable forecast from available history while the pipeline clears. This balances service level (protects against stockouts given current large in-transit) with holding cost sensitivity (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent weekly demand has averaged roughly 115\u2013120 units (history: 99,141,117,112,118,100,123 plus the Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=365 \u2014 a large pipeline that should cover multiple weeks given promised L=2. Recent concluded messages confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4), so use the promised/default lead-time assumption. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend computes base-stock consistent with long-run sample stats while recognizing the large in-transit position. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is made because recent concludes confirm L=2.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (P2->P4, P6->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=351 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand (historical samples mean \u2248 112). No new sustained demand regime detected. Choose L by \xe2\u20ac\u0153calculate\xe2\u20ac to lock in observed lead time (avg observed =2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given profit/holding (profit=$4, holding=$1) while avoiding overreacting to transient missing arrivals.

Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded arrivals (P2->P4, P6->P8) confirm actual lead time \u22482 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=392 (large pipeline). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (will be 2). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; conservative baseline given limited samples and noisy recent spikes. These settings ensure ordering accounts for the 2-period lead time while relying on historical demand statistics to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=351. Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2)=2, P8 (order P6)=2, P10 (order P9)=1 \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand has risen vs. early samples; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (last 5 demand observations) so base_stock reflects recent higher demand while controlling holding cost. This balances service level given substantial in-transit inventory and uncertain lead-time variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Demand recent weeks elevated and volatile (recent demands: P7=123, P8=182, P9=101, P10=85, P11=99). On-hand=0, in-transit=411 \u2014 many overdue shipments historically (multiple early orders never concluded). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: 2,2,1 \u2192 avg ~1.67. To account for observed variability in lead time while relying on backend inference, I request the backend calculate average observed lead time (use empirical concluded lead times). For demand I focus on the most recent regime (last 5 weeks) because demand increased and is volatile; use recent_N N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap reflect the latest higher mean and variance. This balances service (capture recent demand spike) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume and shipment uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history shows weekly demands ~95\u2013182 with recent zero on-hand and high in-transit. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while letting the engine cap orders using its cap formula.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Observed concluded lead times in history = {P4:2, P8:2, P10:1, P13:2} indicating recent average lead time < promised 2 but variable (~1.75). Demand history (weekly samples including provided 5-sample seed) shows stable weekly demand in the ~95\u2013182 range with no confirmed sustained regime shift. Given variable but close-to-promised lead time, use calculated average lead time so the OR engine sees the empirical LT; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) to produce a conservative base-stock while leveraging observed variability. This balances service (high profit/higher z*) against holding cost and avoids overreacting to short noisy fluctuations.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand history centers ~100 units/week with occasional spikes (e.g., 182). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large pipeline including previously delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2} \u2192 avg ~1.67; I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use default (backend will set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)) and default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while letting the OR engine cap orders using its cap formula. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments now since concluded arrivals mainly confirm L\u22482 but with one short lead-time sample.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (lots of pipeline but arrivals are only visible next period). Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P4),2 (P8),1 (P10),2 (P13)} \u2192 avg = 1.75, so use calculated average lead time rather than promised 2 to better match observed behavior. Recent demand shows a stable recent regime (Periods 12-16 demands = 93,79,92,95,97); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current ~90s demand level over the review+lead period. These choices make the OR backend compute base-stock tuned to the recent lower demand while using an empirical lead time, reducing overstock risk given a large existing in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large outstanding pipeline from prior missing/delayed shipments). Recent concluded lead-times show variability but average shifted below promised; use backend-calculated average lead time to reflect observed history. Demand has stepped down in recent weeks (Periods 13-17 demands = 79,92,95,97,86; recent mean ~90). To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples so the forecast reflects the current lower regime and reduces order quantity. These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N=5, sigma_hat recent_N=5) tell the OR engine to use observed lead-time average and recent demand mean/volatility, limiting new orders while existing in-transit stock arrives.

I set L using calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand history (samples provided) is limited and shows no clear recent regime shift, so I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff and the inferred lead time.

Observed lead times vary; backend should compute average observed lead time from concluded history. To be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 5 periods. L set to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history (more accurate than promised=2 given past variation). This balances service level (capture recent lower demand) against holding cost while recognizing substantial in-transit stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed values include 2,2,1,2 \u2192 avg ~1.67). Demand has fallen materially in recent weeks. I set L to calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new low-demand regime (uses last 4 observed demands) so mu_hat reflects the reduced demand over review+lead. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect lower recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding cost while keeping service given remaining in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: recent avg demand (Periods 19-22) = 53.5 units vs prior Periods 4-13 avg = 109.2 (\u221251%), sustained for 4 periods.

Use observed lead times to let backend infer actual average \u2014 choose L=calculate. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 19-22). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect reduced variability in the new regime. These settings keep base-stock tied to the confirmed lower demand, while relying on the backend to cap orders given the large in-transit volume and promised lead time.

To avoid overstocking given large in-transit and the persistent low-demand regime, set demand forecast and volatility from the recent regime (last 6 periods, Periods 19-24). Methods chosen: L=calculate (lets backend infer avg observed lead time); mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture lower recent mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent reduced volatility. This keeps orders conservative while the large in-transit quantity covers expected demand over lead+review.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 19 (Periods 19\u201325 demands: 72,67,50,25,37,35,13) \u2014 a sustained lower regime. In-transit = 370 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times have been mixed but previously averaged ~1.67; however promised lead time remains 2 and there is no new sustained lead-time change. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (regime length Periods 19\u201325 = 7) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent mean over the review+lead period. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=7 to capture volatility in the recent low-demand regime. These settings reduce ordering aggressiveness given the large in-transit stock and lower recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Use inferred average observed lead time (calculate) to let backend reconcile actual arrivals vs promised. For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 19-26) to capture the new low-demand regime. Use sigma recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical arrivals show variable lead-times with recent evidence averaging ~1.67 (carry-over). Demand has shifted down starting Period 19 and remained low for 9 periods (Periods 19-27 avg \u2248 39). To reflect confirmed shorter/variable lead-time use calculate so backend uses observed lead-times average. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=9 to capture the new low-demand regime (N chosen = regime length capped by rules). These parameters lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding while covering the (1+L) review+lead demand under the current low-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 19 (low, sustained for many periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (several earlier orders remain in-transit but we must not assume further arrivals beyond concluded history). Set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals (captures actual lead-time evidence). For demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (uses most recent 10 weeks since the regime shift beginning Period 19) so the base-stock and caps reflect the lower demand and reduced variability, lowering overstock risk while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (some earlier shipments delayed/lost). Demand has shifted sharply down since Period 19. I set L by averaging observed concluded lead times (use 'calculate') to let backend infer current effective lead time from evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 19\u201329) to capture the sustained low-demand regime when forecasting (mu_hat) and its volatility (sigma_hat). This prevents ordering to pre-shift levels given large in-transit volume and high holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and extended: Periods 19\u201329 average demand = 40.82 units (11 samples) vs prior Periods 4\u201313 avg = 109.2 (\u221262.6%), sustained for 11 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P4), 2 (P8), 1 (P10), 2 (P13) \u2192 actual lead time average \u22481.75; use calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand has shifted down since Period 19: recent 12-week average (Periods 19\u201330) = 39.83 units vs prior ~109.2 (\u221264%), a sustained low-demand regime; use recent_N with N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk given high in-transit and lower demand while still covering expected (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 19 (sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large pipeline). Use observed lead-time history rather than promised. Observed concluded lead_times = {P4:2, P8:2, P10:1, P13:2} \u2192 recent average ~1.75. For demand forecast use the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201332, 14 samples) to avoid overstocking. Chosen: L = recent_N (average of last 4 observed lead times) to reflect actual arrivals; mu_hat = recent_N with N=14 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of recent low-demand samples; sigma_hat = recent_N with N=14 to capture recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 2-period observations and some 1-periods; use averaged observed lead time. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 19; use recent samples to set forecast and volatility so the OR backend reduces stock targets and holding cost. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect actual shipping behavior. For demand mean and sigma I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 19\u201333) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces base_stock and cap to avoid excess holding).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (confirmed in prior carry-overs). Observed concluded lead-times include multiple 2s and some 1s; use backend 'calculate' so OR computes average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I choose recent_N to focus the forecast on the low-demand regime: N=17 (Periods 19\u201335 = 17 samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=17 to capture current volatility. These choices reduce excess stocking risk given sustained lower demand while letting the backend cap orders; they also rely on concluded lead-time evidence rather than promised lead-time alone. In-transit 370 units already provide cover\u2014parameters bias towards lower new orders to avoid high holding costs.

Product is seasonal sports-bra; historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (June) with 18 recent weekly samples (Periods 19\u201336) far below earlier averages. On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large pipeline) \u2014 do not assume lost shipments but lots of stock arriving in future. Promised lead time=2 remains the default since recent concluded arrivals are sparse and average observed lead time estimates are noisy. For demand forecasting I use recent_N=18 to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201336) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding costs while the large in-transit quantity covers short-term demand and reduces stockout risk.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 19 (recent avg ~38 units/week, sustained 15 weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large pipeline from earlier orders). Observed concluded arrivals historically indicate actual lead time \u22482 most often but varied (avg ~1.67 earlier). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=15 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 19\u201333 evidence) so base-stock and caps are computed from the relevant recent mean and volatility. This downscales target inventory to avoid high holding cost while preserving service for current lower demand; large in-transit stock is already available to cover near-term demand and reduces need for large new orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (Periods 19\u201333 avg = 38.13 over 15 samples). Observed concluded lead times (most recent sample set: P4=2, P8=2, P10=1) average 1.67; use a short recent average to capture this. Set L via recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed lead-time average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to align the OR forecast with the confirmed low-demand regime (uses last 15 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This reduces over-ordering given large in-transit and lowers holding cost while maintaining service given lower demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand has remained in the lower regime since Period 19 (sustained drop confirmed in carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large compared to recent weekly demand ~20\u201350). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude history) = {2,2,1,2} => average ~1.75; I'll let backend calculate average observed lead time. To capture the sustained low-demand regime I use recent demand (most recent 20 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects the lower mean and volatility and avoids overordering despite large in-transit. These choices help the OR engine reduce service-level targets consistent with lower demand while letting the backend cap orders relative to pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 19 (confirmed in prior carry-overs; recent mean ~38 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (large pipeline). No new sustained lead-time evidence since prior conclusions; keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand forecast use recent_N=15 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201333 length=15) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstocking risk given large in-transit inventory while maintaining service for the lower-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Demand has undergone a sustained downshift since Period 19 (recent 15-period avg \u2248 38 units vs prior ~109), so forecast should use the recent low-demand regime. There is large in-transit volume (370) from earlier orders but on-hand = 0; arrivals have been sporadic historically. For lead time I ask backend to infer from concluded arrivals (use calculate) so the OR engine averages observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201333/ recent 15 samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=15 to capture volatility in the new regime. These parameters bias ordering toward the lower, current demand level while letting the OR engine set service level via profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical concluded lead_times show recent arrivals with lead_times [2,1,2] -> avg ~1.67; demand has exhibited a sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (confirmed across many periods). I set L using recent short-run observed lead times (N=3) to reflect the empirically observed lead-time ~1.67 rather than blindly using the promised 2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the prolonged low-demand regime (Periods 19+), so the OR engine's base-stock is computed from the recent lower mean and lower variance, reducing overstock risk given large in-transit and holding cost >0. This balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed regime shift and sizable pipeline inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (overdue shipments historically observed). Demand has been in the lowered regime since Period 19 (sustained). Recent observed lead-times (concluded) show variability around ~1.7\u20131.8 periods; I use recent_N for L to capture latest actual lead-time evidence. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base forecasts on the sustained low-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and caps inventory risk). These choices aim to limit over-ordering given large in-transit volume and the confirmed lower demand regime while reflecting slightly shorter observed lead-time behavior.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (documented in carry-over). Observed concluded lead times are mixed but recent average ~1.67; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current realized lead time from history. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained low-demand regime: regime length since Period 19 = 26 samples, capped at 20 \u2192 N=20. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses forecasting on the low-demand period and reduces ordering risk given large in-transit volume. This balances service (avoid stockouts when in-transit arrives) versus holding cost by not inflating demand estimates with prior high-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed avg \u22481.67) so I let backend calculate average from concluded data (method=calculate). Recent demand shows a single extreme spike (Periods 43-45 = 18, 32, 409) suggesting a near-term holiday surge; to quickly react I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine weights the spike heavily while still using observed lead-time estimate. This balances service (high profit/holding ratio -> q\u22480.8) against holding cost and avoids overcommitting to long-term higher base stock given prior sustained low-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=783 (large pipeline from P46 order). Historical recent demand is highly volatile with extreme holiday spikes (P45=409, P46=338) but prior long-run regime was much lower (~38 units). Use observed lead-time averaging to let backend infer current effective L from concluded arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 42\u201346) to capture the holiday surge and short-term volatility so the OR engine raises target stock this period; in-transit + new orders should cover the elevated near-term demand while avoiding overstating long-term demand shift.
