Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~39.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change (only 5 weeks of stable history). Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a baseline base-stock that balances service vs holding given known profit/holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand history (5 samples: 42,40,35,42,38) shows mean ~39.4 and modest variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (order placed in Period 1 not concluded yet). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals contradicting promised lead time, so use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute base-stock while preserving service vs. holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (two prior orders of 45). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change, so remain conservative and use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand mean = 39.4 (5 samples). Using default formulas tied to L ensures OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility consistently; this balances service level (covers current+lead periods) while avoiding premature manual inflation given no confirmed regime shift or lost-shipment conclusion.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 (45,45,48) did not arrive (arrived=0), although promised lead time is 2. On-hand is 0, in-transit shows 138 units (these prior orders), so shipments are delayed or lost. I conservatively set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delay beyond promised 2 and to avoid under-ordering while arrivals remain uncertain. Demand history (five weekly samples mean\u224839.4) is stable with no clear upward seasonality; I use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean across samples, and sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase pipeline cover for the extra observed delay while keeping demand forecast anchored to historical weekly mean to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (45,45,48) all reported arrived=0 by Period 3 conclude, indicating actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods or shipments are lost; treat lead time as increased until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demand samples (42,40,35,42,38) have mean \u224839.4 and std \u22482.65. On-hand=0, in-transit=151 units (several prior orders outstanding; Period 4 conclude confirmed one arrival: order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2). Orders from P1 and P3 remained unconfirmed by Period 4 conclude and may be delayed/lost, but observed lead time evidence so far supports promised lead time=2. Given in-transit (151) already exceeds the default forecast for (1+L)\xd7mean, I keep lead time at default (promised) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend will likely order zero this period, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service from current pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent demand samples (historic weeks Jan\u2013Feb) average ~39.4/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (outstanding orders include earlier periods; some shipments delayed). Period 4 conclude shows arrived=45 (ordered P2) giving observed lead_time=2 for that order; earlier orders (P1,P3) remained missing but one arrival confirms promised lead time is attainable. To balance service vs holding cost, use the backend default lead time (promised L=2) so the OR engine's pipeline calculations align with observed on-time arrivals, and use default demand/volatility scaling based on all samples for stable baseline forecasting (no strong sustained demand regime change detected).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=151. History shows mixed lead times: observed arrivals imply lead times 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6); some earlier shipments were delayed/missing but recent arrivals confirm variability. Use calculated average lead time to capture observed variability. Demand history available but no strong, sustained regime shift requiring adjustment, so use default demand mu and sigma (backend will scale by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). This balances service vs holding given pipeline is already large (151 units).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows lead time behavior consistent with the promised 2-period lead time (e.g., Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, lead_time=2) though there have been intermittent 1-period arrivals and earlier delayed/missing shipments. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=183 \u2014 pipeline is ample to cover upcoming demand, so use the backend's default assumptions. Choose default lead time to let the OR engine use promised L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecasts are anchored to the full historical sample set, avoiding overreaction to noisy/partial arrivals. This balances service (large in-transit already) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:1} suggesting a short-term shift toward 1\u20132 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=229 (large pipeline). Demand has surged recently (last 3 demands: 84,150,118) so I base demand forecast on the most recent regime. Set L using recent_N to capture the recent lead-time mix. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility, which raises the base-stock to balance service vs holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (Period6-9: 84,150,118,64) vs historical sample mean ~39.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=401 \u2014 sufficient to cover (1+L) periods under promised lead time. Some earlier shipments were delayed/missing but subsequent conclude messages show arrivals with lead times of 2 and 1 periods (variable). To be conservative and use contractual promise, keep L as default (promised=2). Use default demand estimates based on full sample history so the OR backend uses stable \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 while in-transit stock mitigates recent volatility and potential lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1070.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (higher weekly demand) and mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods). I set L using recent observed lead times (last 5 observed lead times) to reflect current variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 6-10) because those five periods form a new, sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while accounting for lead-time variability and avoiding relying on older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg weekly demand increased from 47.0 (Periods 1-5) to 96.4 (Periods 6-10), +105% (periods 6-10 show sustained higher demand).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime since Period 6 (avg ~96.4/week, much higher than early samples). On-hand=108, in-transit=211 (healthy pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded arrivals support L=2. To align the OR engine with the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples (last N=5 periods, Periods 6-10) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent high-demand regime, giving a higher base-stock and appropriate safety stock given the high service target (q\u22480.95 from profit/ (profit+holding)). This balances fill-rate against holding cost while respecting observed lead-time behavior.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=32, in-transit=285. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 6 (Periods 6-12 high demand); shipments since Period 4 show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals but promised lead time remains 2 and was confirmed in prior carry-over. I set L to default (promised 2). To reflect the higher recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 6\u201312), so the OR engine will size base-stock to the new higher mean/volatility while the cap limits extreme orders. This prioritizes service given high profit ($19) but keeps holding exposure controlled by using recent regime stats.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime higher since Period 6 (avg ~96.4 in P6-10) but has softened in last 3 weeks; current on-hand=53, in-transit=271 (total pipeline=324) which comfortably covers several weeks of elevated demand. Past shipments showed variable lead times but recent concluded arrivals confirm promised lead time=2 is reasonable to use. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (backend expects 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 6-13) to capture the post-changepoint regime while allowing the backend to scale by (1+L). For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices balance service (capture higher post-shift mean) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (Periods 6-14 show sustained elevated weekly demand). Current on-hand=73, in-transit=225 (pipeline sufficient vs. recent demand). Observed concluded lead times recently: several 2-period confirmations (e.g., P11->P13, P12->P14), so use the promised lead time (default). For demand forecast, use recent_N over the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 6-14, 9 samples) to capture the sustained higher mean; set sigma_hat to recent_N with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher demand while avoiding understocking given confirmed lead time=2 and moderate holding cost (hold=$1, profit=$19).

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=10, in-transit=266 \u2192 total pipeline=276. Historical demand samples (given) mean=39.4; with promised L=2, default (1+L)*mean \u2248118.2 demand across review+lead. Pipeline comfortably exceeds that, so maintain default lead time and demand estimates. No recent sustained missing-shipment signal since arrivals in Periods 10\u201314 matched promised L\u22482. Using default L/mu/sigma keeps the OR backend's baseline forecast and avoids overreacting to noisy lead-time variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=266; pipeline looks large but many past orders had variable lead times (1\u20132) and some late arrivals; recent concluded arrivals show lead time around promised 2 so I keep L as default. Demand evidence: sustained higher-demand regime established in Periods 6\u201310, but recent six weeks (Periods 11\u201316) show mean \u224869.3 with high variability and a large spike (108). To reflect the recent realized demand level and volatility I use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent variability, balancing service vs holding given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1). No new carry-over patterns meet the 3+ period new-sustained threshold.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (avg weekly demand roughly doubled). Lead-time observations fluctuate 1\u20132 but recent confirms frequent 2-period arrivals; promised lead time is 2. To prioritize service during the elevated-demand regime, I use the promised lead time (default) and estimate demand using the most recent observations (capture post-shift behavior) with N=10 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short spikes. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=10 to reflect current variability. This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check via the OR backend cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=293. Historical concludes show lead time behaves like 2 periods frequently and earlier missing shipments resolved; no new sustained lead-time evidence, so keep promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (carry-over recorded) \u2014 use recent data to capture the elevated mean and current volatility. I choose L=default to use the promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean from the last 10 demand samples and reflect the sustained higher demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet the higher demand regime while keeping holding cost informed by recent variability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1s and 2s) with a recent tilt toward 2 but not exclusively; demand has clearly shifted up since Period 6 and recent 9 weeks (Periods 11-19) are representative. On-hand=0, in-transit=235 covers multiple future periods but we must set parameters that reflect the sustained higher-demand regime. I set L using recent_N to average the last 5 observed lead times (captures recent variability while weighting recent 2-week tendency). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the nine most recent demand observations (Periods 11-19), which matches the sustained higher-demand regime. These choices help the OR backend target a higher base stock to avoid stockouts in the elevated-demand regime while using recent volatility to limit excess holding given the holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=286. Historical concluded lead times (periods with arrivals) average \u22481.56 (mix of 1s and 2s), so use calculated average rather than default promised 2. Demand doubled starting Period 6 (carry-over) and has been sustained; use recent data to forecast (capture most recent 15 periods post-shift). Recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat (N=15) will reflect the higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances service level (higher mu_hat) against low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19). In-transit stock likely covers multiple periods but some shipments were previously delayed; using calculated L and recent demand reduces stockouts while limiting excess holding.

Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained elevated weekly demand) and recent weeks include extreme spike (Period 21=393) but not yet a sustained new regime. Promised lead time=2 has been observed frequently (1\u20132 periods variability) so use default promised L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 16 periods (Periods 6\u201321) to reflect current demand level and volatility; this balances service vs holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (avg demand much higher); lead times observed vary but have recently averaged 1\u20132 and were confirmed as 2 in prior evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=493 \u2014 this pipeline already covers multiple review+lead periods but may include late/varied arrivals. I set L to default (promised lead time=2) because recent concluded arrivals align with 1\u20132 and no new sustained change in lead time is confirmed. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (periods 6\u201322) to capture the new higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand data. For volatility I also use recent_N N=17 to reflect realized variability in the same regime. These choices give the OR backend a forecast tied to the confirmed higher-demand regime and recent variability while keeping lead time as the contractual default so the capped ordering rule applies correctly given the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows demand regime shift confirmed in Period 11 (sustained higher mean since Period 6) and variable observed lead times (1\u20132 periods). Current position: on-hand=184, in-transit=332 (total pipeline=516) \u2014 ample coverage versus typical weekly demand samples. To let the backend infer the operational lead time from observed concl\xfcdes and to use the full historical demand sample (which captures the confirmed regime shift), I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service (captures higher recent demand) while avoiding overfitting to noisy recent spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand remains in the higher regime established at Period 6 (sustained weekly demands >> earlier periods). On-hand=56 + in-transit=332 provides ample cover vs recent weekly demand, and there are no currently overdue shipments. Use lead-time estimate from observed history (calculate) because observed arrivals show a mix of 1- and 2-period lead times; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand weeks (Periods 20-24 = 105, 393, 264, 74, 128) so the backend sets base-stock appropriate to current regime while controlling volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=745. Historical concludes show lead time fluctuating between 1\u20132 but previously confirmed as 2; no sustained shift beyond that. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (most recent 5 demands: 393, 264, 74, 128, 99) \u2014 using a short recent window captures current regime and recent spikes while allowing the OR engine to compute base_stock over (1+L) periods. I choose L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecast to the most recent demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture recent high demand) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 \u2014 large pipeline expected to cover upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed sequence: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,3) giving an average \u22481.75; occasional 3-period arrival observed but not sustained. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (noted in carry-over). To balance service and holding cost: set lead time to the calculated average (captures recent variability), and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting the OR engine apply its capped policy against the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133) with several delayed arrivals but overall pipeline large: on-hand=322, in-transit=448. Demand shifted up around Period 6 (recorded previously). To be conservative about delivery uncertainty I ask the backend to compute L via observed arrivals (calculate) so average realized lead time is used instead of assuming promised. For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so forecasts incorporate full historical demand and the chosen L; this balances service level (by reflecting realized lead time) versus holding cost given our already-large pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 6 (carry-over). Current inventory: on-hand=240, in-transit=448. Pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs typical weekly demand but demand has been volatile and elevated since Period 6. Observed lead times have varied but recent concluded arrivals are consistent with the promised 2-period lead time; therefore keep L as default (promised). For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-changepoint high-demand regime to capture the elevated mean/variance: choose N=20 to cover the most recent 20 demand observations (captures sustained higher demand since Period 6). Use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service during the higher-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap formula to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=47, in-transit=448. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); using recent_N for L with N=5 yields an average lead time \u22482 which matches most recent observations. Demand exhibited a sustained regime shift upward around Period 6; to prioritize recent elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the latest demand level and volatility across recent weeks. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while using recent volatility to limit excess holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=559. Historical conclude messages show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (previously recorded). Pipeline is large (559) but arrivals are subject to variable lead times; no new multi-period lead-time change confirmed. I keep L at promised (default) so OR backend uses 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean) and reduce influence of older low-demand data. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand history; keeping L=default avoids incorrectly extending lead time without new conclude evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=635. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (avg demand jumped ~+105%) and many observed lead times varying but averaging \u22481.62 periods (observed sample lead times: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,3,2). To respect observed variability in arrivals while letting the OR backend use its promised-lead-time model, I set L=calculate so the backend uses the average observed lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (gives (1+L)*mean over the most recent 20 demand samples). Sigma also uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while relying on the larger in-transit position to limit over-ordering given modest holding cost (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Historical concluded lead times vary but recent conclude messages confirm promised lead time=2 is frequently observed; multiple past delays noted but not sustained beyond isolated periods. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift earlier (Periods 6-10) and since then large weekly variability, but no new 3+ period change detected. Using default lead time lets backend assume promised L=2 while relying on rich arrival history. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given substantial pipeline (455) and moderate on-hand (84). This keeps orders conservative while avoiding overreaction to isolated late arrivals.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (avg ~96/wk) and variable actual lead times (observed arrivals imply average lead time ~1.69 periods, sometimes 1\u20133). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=455 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers upcoming demand given in-transit. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures actual lead-time mix ~1.7). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat on the recent high-demand regime (captures elevated mean over older low-demand samples). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline: using recent data prevents underordering for the new regime while relying on observed lead-time average avoids overcompensating for occasional 3-period delays.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=657. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (higher mean sustained through recent periods). Earlier missing shipments were resolved and lead time has been observed as 2 in multiple concludes, so use promised lead time. To capture the new, sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (use N=20 capped by rule) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from recent high-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu) against holding cost by relying on recent demand evidence while keeping lead time at the contractual default.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=650 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times but no sustained deviation from promised L=2 that requires explicit override; use promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (documented) \u2014 use a recent-sample forecast to capture current mean/volatility. Select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 20 periods of demand data so the OR backend sets base-stock appropriate to the higher-demand regime while capping orders via its cap.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=656. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 6 with materially higher weekly demand since then; recent weeks remain volatile. Promised lead time=2 but historical actual lead times varied; no new sustained lead-time change confirmed. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) so backend uses contractual lead time, and I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand samples. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods, some lost/delayed shipments early) but recent patterns include many 1\u20132 period arrivals with occasional 3s. Demand history shows the sustained higher-demand regime identified earlier (Periods 6\u201310 onward). To be conservative about supply uncertainty while letting the OR engine compute the appropriate base-stock for current variability, I request the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method: calculate) and use the defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so they incorporate all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This leverages the observed lead-time variability while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost given the full demand history and the promised lead time input. The large in-transit (650) will be accounted for by the backend when computing pipeline inventory; using calculated L ensures pipeline coverage aligns with observed arrival behavior.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical concluded lead times vary but recent evidence supports using the promised/default lead time for the OR engine while the large pipeline is expected to cover upcoming demand. Recent demand (Periods 35-39 = 58,35,57,53,37) shows a lower, more stable regime vs. earlier spikes; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the last 5 weeks, which prevents over-ordering given the sizable in-transit stock and low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical concluded lead-times vary (observed LT samples average ~1.67) but have ranged 1\u20133; demand regime shift occurred at Period 6 (sustained higher demand thereafter). To let the OR engine infer realized lead time from concluded history, set L via calculate (average observed LT). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime while limiting to recent data; same recent_N N=20 for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices balance service (capture higher recent mean/variance) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=650 (large pipeline but arrival timing uncertain). Recent demand (Periods 37-41) = [57,53,37,57,110], recent mean \u224862.8 with volatile spike at P41. Promised lead time is 2; recent concluded history shows mixed 1\u20133 periods but no sustained new lead-time regime, so keep L=default to let backend assume promised lead time. To capture recent demand level and volatility, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) so the base-stock reflects the current higher/volatile demand while keeping responsiveness to the P41 spike. This balances service (profit >> holding cost) against inventory risk given large in-transit volume.

Recent demand has trended up in the last several weeks (Periods 39\u201342: 37,57,110,162) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N with N=5 to make the forecast responsive to the latest regime while keeping variance estimated from recent samples.

On-hand=0, in-transit=650 which provides sizable coverage; to balance service vs holding cost I use an empirically estimated lead time and focus mu/sigma on the recent high-demand regime (use last 20 weeks) to reflect current demand levels while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical history shows a past sustained regime increase (Periods 6-10) but recent weeks (Periods 40-44) are noisy with a downward drift from earlier peaks. Large in-transit stock mitigates risk of stockout, so keep promised lead time. Use a recent_N forecast to capture the latest demand level (responsive to the recent drop) and reduce over-ordering risk; apply same recent window for volatility to reflect current variability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=650. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 6 (avg up ~+105%); lead time has often varied but was confirmed as 2 in prior evidence. To respect the backend's use of promised lead time while leveraging the confirmed demand regime, I keep L as default (promised=2) and set demand forecasts using the most recent stable high-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (use max capped N=20 for the long elevated-demand period). This increases target base-stock to cover current high demand while sigma estimated from the same recent window to set appropriate safety stock. Given large in-transit (650), this will let the OR engine cap orders appropriately and avoid over-ordering if shipments arrive.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (many 1\u20133), computed average lead time \u22481.7 periods so use calculate to adapt to observed actuals. Use default demand and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock formula given the inferred L. This balances service (use observed longer-than-promised lead times) against holding cost while relying on full-sample demand stats.
