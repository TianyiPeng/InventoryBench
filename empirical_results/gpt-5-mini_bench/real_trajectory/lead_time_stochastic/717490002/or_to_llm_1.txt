Demand & OR check: historical weekly demand mean = (42+40+35+42+38)/5 = 39.4 units. OR's capped base-stock recommendation is 37 units, which aligns with single-period demand and the OR's high-service safety factor (q=19/(19+1)=0.95). Inventory posture: on-hand=0, in-transit=118 (unconfirmed). Risk trade-offs: Holding cost is low ($1) vs. profit $19, so some overstock is tolerable, but double-ordering while a large in-transit shipment might still arrive risks unnecessary holding if the shipment appears late rather than lost. Decision: Place 37 units (follow OR). This provides coverage for roughly one week's expected demand while avoiding aggressive reorders that could cause excess inventory if the in-transit 118 later concludes.

However, earlier orders (Period 1:118 and Period 4:37) remained unarrived through multiple concludes and were flagged as suspect in carry-over insights; this indicates some in-transit units may be lost or delayed and pipeline reliability is questionable. Inventory & demand analysis: Visible on-hand = 0. System reports in-transit = 275 which equals outstanding orders from P1(118)+P4(37)+P6(64)+P7(56); carry-over notes treat P1 and P4 (155 units) as suspect until confirmed by arrivals.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history shows variable lead times and earlier prolonged missing shipments; recent concludes (P45 arrival of P43 order, multiple 2\u20133 period arrivals) but pipeline remains partially unreliable. Inventory & demand: On-hand=312 and in-transit=923 (some of which may be lost) vs. recent weekly demand ~40\u201350 (P43\u2013P46: 42,34,51,40 \u2248 42/wk). Promised L=2 so (L+1)=3 periods coverage target \u2248 125 units; current on-hand alone covers ~7+ weeks. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit \u2014 holding many extra units reduces objective. OR baseline recommends 0 using promised L and historical demand; given ample on-hand and suspect pipeline, ordering risks extra holding cost and wasted pipeline exposure. Decision: place no order this period to avoid increasing holding costs and to let existing on-hand absorb demand while we wait for pipeline confirmations. Monitor upcoming conclude for actual arrivals and reassess if concluded arrivals are lower than expected.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order (follow OR): on-hand (312) already far exceeds 3-period demand (~125) and pipeline is large but unreliable\u2014avoid extra holding cost and wait for arrival confirmations.",
