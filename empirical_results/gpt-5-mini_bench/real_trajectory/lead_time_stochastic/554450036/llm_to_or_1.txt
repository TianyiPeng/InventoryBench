Running full CSV horizon: 47 periods

Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time. Historical weekly samples (71,60,46,48,62) show no clear changepoint and recent period count is small. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats: set L=default so backend uses promised L=2; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using full sample mean) against holding cost without overreacting to limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=75 (order from P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time is unknown; promised lead time (2) will be used. Historical sample mean ~57.4 over five weeks; no clear demand regime shift or seasonality yet. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost conservatively while we await concluded arrivals to detect any lead-time or demand changes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded messages show no arrivals yet (orders placed in P1 and P2 both arrived=0), but promised lead time is 2 and we have insufficient concluded evidence to change it. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (pipeline sizable). I use default lead time (promised L=2) because actual lead time cannot be inferred from available concludes. Demand history (samples mean=57.4) is stable; I use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of all samples to reflect the long-run mean and default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (captures average demand over review+lead) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=212. Orders placed in Period 1 did not arrive by Period 3 conclude (arrived=0), indicating at least one missed shipment or longer lead time than promised. To be conservative and cover additional in-transit risk, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. Demand history (5 weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) will be used by default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost under the longer lead time estimate.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). History shows one concluded arrival: Period 4 arrived 80 units from an order placed in Period 2 \u2192 observed lead time = 2. On-hand=31, in-transit=203 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=234 units. Historical weekly demand samples (71,60,46,48,62) mean=57.4. I set L by average of observed lead times to capture confirmed evidence (calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L=2 this targets a 3-period demand cover while letting the OR engine apply its service-level cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts given existing pipeline) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory and modest holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand samples (71,60,46,48,62) give mean=57.4. One concluded arrival shows actual observed lead time = 2 (Period4: ordered P2 arrived P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=203 which already exceeds (1+L)*mean demand for L=2 (3*57.4=172.2), so no aggressive uplift needed. I use 'calculate' for L to let backend confirm average observed lead time (matches promised=2), and default statistical aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps target base-stock rooted in historical demand while relying on pipeline (203 units) to cover upcoming (L+1) periods and avoids excess holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent weekly demand samples (historical seed) average ~57.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=209 units which currently covers ~3 weeks of demand. One concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period 4 concluded arrival from Period 2), consistent with promised lead time. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend confirm the estimate. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging full history). This balances service (using full-sample mean over the review+lead window) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock (209 units) that already covers expected demand for the review+lead horizon.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has softened vs. the older Jan samples: last 4 concluded demands = {49,49,42,43} (avg 45.75). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 209 (multiple past orders remain unconcluded). Only one concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Several other orders never concluded/arrived, suggesting lost/delayed shipments; to be conservative I keep promised lead time and base demand forecasts on the most recent regime (last 4 periods). I select L=default to keep the OR engine's assumed lead time at the promised value (2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the recent lower-demand regime so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the last 4 samples, balancing service level and holding cost given limited on-hand but large in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time for one concluded shipment: Period2 order arrived Period4 \u2192 lead_time = 2; Multiple subsequent orders remain unconcluded (Periods 3,5-7), indicating probable lost/delayed shipments\u2014monitor for persistent losses.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been volatile with weeks: 75,60,72,49,49,42,43,70 and historical samples (Jan-Feb) 71,60,46,48,62. On-hand=0, in-transit=203 \u2014 pipeline is large but several earlier orders remained unconcluded for multiple periods suggesting lost/delayed shipments; however two concluded arrivals (P2\u2192P4 and P6\u2192P8) confirm actual lead time = 2. I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time data (average observed = 2). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level (profit/holding ratio favors stocking) while letting the backend cap orders given uncertainty and observed pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=207. Two concluded shipments show lead_time=2 (Period2\u21924 and Period6\u21928), so actual lead time confirmed at 2. Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 2). Demand samples are limited and no sustained regime shift detected, so use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps provisioning aligned with observed lead time while relying on historical demand to balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) against holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=203; historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P9->P10) \u2014 mixed but centered near 2. Demand history sample mean from provided weeks is stable (mean \u224857.4). Several orders remain unconcluded historically, suggesting possible lost/delayed shipments but evidence is not yet a sustained regime change. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 signals). For demand magnitude and volatility I use 'default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples), which is appropriate given no confirmed sustained demand shift; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreaction to possible lost shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weekly demand samples show high, variable demand (historic samples: 71,60,46,48,62 plus observed period demands through P11). On-hand=0, in-transit=203 \u2014 pipeline large but many prior orders experienced delays/losses; concluded lead times observed = {P4:2, P8:2, P10:1} (mostly 2). I choose L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed but mainly 2-period reality). For demand forecast and uncertainty I select mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples; this is conservative given limited data and volatile demand. These choices let the OR engine raise base stock for multi-period coverage under the inferred longer lead time while using full-sample statistics to avoid overreacting to short-term spikes or single delayed shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand is volatile and elevated (history: weekly samples 71,60,46,48,62 and many later weekly demands 72,49,49,42,43,70,44,45,40,55). On-hand=0, in-transit=203 but multiple past orders remained unconcluded \u2192 probable lost/delayed shipments; conserve assumptions by inferring lead time from observed concludes rather than promised. Set L via calculate (avg observed lead times = (2,2,1) \u2192 ~1.67) to capture measured lead-time behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, giving a balanced base-stock against holding cost (profit=$19, holding=$1) while letting OR engine apply its z* service-level tradeoff. This approach is robust to missing shipments and leverages confirmed lead-time evidence without overfitting to recent noise.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent observed weekly demand shows an uptick (Periods 11-13: 40,55,64) vs earlier weeks; pipeline = 203 but on-hand=0 with several past orders unconcluded suggesting prior shipments may be delayed/lost. For lead time I choose 'calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (we have observed 2,2,1 \u2192 avg ~1.67) rather than trusting promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest regime (Periods 9-13 demands: 44,45,40,55,64) which captures the emerging higher demand. For volatility I keep 'default' so backend uses full-sample variance scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings bias orders up modestly to cover the recent demand rise while the calculated L reflects actual observed lead times; using recent demand reduces risk of understocking during the uptick while default sigma avoids overreacting to short-run noise.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has risen (periods 10-14: 45,40,55,64,107) and several past orders failed to conclude on-time, so I use observed lead-time history to let backend infer LT while sizing safety stock from the recent high-demand regime. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend average concluded lead times (captures observed 2,2,1). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent higher mean; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This increases target base stock to protect service during the current higher-demand regime while relying on backend LT estimate to partly mitigate lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variable: observed lead_times = 2 (orders P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8) and 1 (P9\u2192P10); multiple orders remain unarrived well past promised LT (orders placed P3, P5, P7, P11\u2013P14), indicating probable lost/delayed shipments requiring monitoring.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=263. Historical concluded lead_times observed = [2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P9\u2192P10)] with many later orders unconcluded/potentially lost. Demand has increased sharply in recent periods (periods 11\u201315 demands = 40,55,64,107,139), so I emphasize recent demand when sizing mu and sigma. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the average of the three most recent observed lead times (captures observed variability 2,2,1). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the clear upward demand regime over the last five periods; this biases the base-stock toward higher safety stock to protect service given missing arrivals while keeping holding cost impact moderate (profit/holding implies high service target). These choices help the OR backend raise target inventory for the now-higher demand regime and variable lead time while not overreacting to single-period spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=360. Recent concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2192 variable LT with average ~1.67. Demand shows a recent uptick starting Period 14 (Period 14-16 demands = 107,139,88). To capture the recent higher demand regime, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times and use recent_N=3 for demand mean/volatility (focus on the three most recent high-demand periods). This increases target base_stock to improve service during the confirmed demand spike while keeping sigma based on the same recent window to reflect elevated volatility. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments here; the OR engine will use the calculated L and recent demand estimates to size orders.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=111, in-transit=251. Historical concluded lead times: {P4:2, P8:2, P10:1, P17(P15\u2192P17):2, P17(P16\u2192P17):1} \u2192 avg observed LT \u2248 1.6. Several orders remain unconcluded long past promised LT, indicating lost/delayed shipments risk but evidence of LT variability (mix of 1 and 2). Demand has been higher recently vs. Jan samples (see carry_over_insight). To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior while relying on full-sample demand statistics, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so backend uses empirical LT; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so base-stock uses stable historical demand stats scaled by (1+L). This balances raising target inventory for slightly longer effective LT while avoiding overfitting to short noisy spikes given some unconcluded orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand (all Jan samples mean=57.4) increased to recent avg (Periods 11\u201317) = 77 (+34%), sustained over 7 periods.

Historical demand shows a sustained upward shift starting Period 11 (Periods 11\u201317 mean \u224877 vs earlier mean \u224857, +34%), so use recent-demand estimates from that post-changepoint regime. Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,2,1] (most recent 5), so set lead time based on recent average. These choices raise target base_stock to cover the higher sustained demand while acknowledging variable lead time and past missing shipments; using recent_N for mu/sigma keeps the forecast responsive while recent_N for L captures recent lead-time variability.

Inventory: on-hand=37, in-transit=264 (several past orders remain unconcluded historically, so pipeline may be unreliable). Lead time history shows variability (observed Ls = 2,2,1,2,1); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 11\u201319 = 9 samples) so the base-stock and cap are increased to meet elevated demand while acknowledging holding cost.

Demand regime shift noted at Period 11 (sustained increase through P17); recent demand volatility persists. For L I use calculate to let backend average observed concluded lead times (observed mix of 1\u20132 periods) rather than blindly trusting promised LT given many missing arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (regime length 7 periods, use N=7). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward the recent higher mean while letting the OR engine infer lead time from actual observed arrivals; this balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and potential lost shipments.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime increased around Period 11 (recent high-demand episodes through Periods 11\u201317); recent demand is elevated versus early-year baseline. Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,1,2,2} (avg \u22481.71) and multiple overdue/unconcluded orders suggest intermittent lost/delayed shipments. To account for true lead-time behavior I ask the backend to calculate average observed lead time (to reflect measured variability). For demand I use a recent-N estimate (N=7) to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11\u201317) rather than all-sample mean. I also use recent-N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while the calculated L helps the OR engine recognize realized lead-time variability and mitigate under-ordering when some shipments are delayed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been elevated vs. early-sample winter baseline but volatile; last 14 periods (P11\u2013P24) average demand \u224864.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=265 \u2014 sizable pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks but some past shipments were delayed or lost; concluded arrivals show realized lead times of 1\u20132 with majority 2 in recent concludes. I set L to 'calculate' so backend will use observed lead-time history (captures mix of 1\u20132). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=14) to reflect the sustained higher recent demand while smoothing older low-winter samples. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=14) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while the large in-transit position limits new order sizes via the OR cap, reducing risk of excess holding given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=288 units (large pipeline covers upcoming weeks despite past missed arrivals). Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 2, some 1); using calculated average lead time so backend infers actual typical LT. For demand I use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201325, N=15) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand. This balances service (higher target stock for the new regime) against holding cost given substantial in-transit volume and potential past lost shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 11 (recent higher mean demand vs. earlier Jan samples). Observed lead times have varied (1\u20133), so use averaged observed lead time rather than promised. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of concluded lead times (~1.875). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=16 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11\u201326; regime length=16) so the base-stock reflects the higher sustained demand while accounting for recent variability. This balances high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) against substantial in-transit inventory (287 units) and prior delayed/lost shipments by relying on recent realized demand rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (multiple past orders showed variable LT and some lost shipments). Use observed concluded lead-times to let backend compute average LT (calculate) to capture variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 (Periods 11\u201327) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and its volatility, so the OR engine raises base-stock to protect service while capping orders via its cap parameter to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=296. Historical concluded lead_times (chronological): 2,2,1,2,1,2,2,3,2 \u2014 recent variability but recent average \u22482. Demand has been elevated since Period 11 (previous insight) and recent weeks show high demand (Periods 22\u201328: 79,73,49,51,91,106,101). To balance service vs holding cost: estimate lead time from most recent observations (stable avg\u22482) using recent_N=5; use recent demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat using last 7 demand samples to reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility. This increases target base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under the new demand regime while keeping sigma based on recent volatility so the OR backend's capped order will limit excessive ordering given possible lost shipments.

Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,2,1,2,2,3,2] (avg=1.89 \u22482) so use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand has been elevated vs. early-year: use recent_N with N=7 (most recent 7 demand samples: Periods 23\u201329) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher regime and short-term demand level. Use recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings increase target base-stock to maintain service given observed higher demand and variable lead times while sigma from recent history moderates safety stock to limit holding cost given large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show variability but recent arrivals are mostly 2 with occasional 1 or 3; last 5 concluded lead times average \u22482.2, so use recent estimate. Demand shifted up at Period 11 and has remained elevated; recent demand is higher than the early-sample mean, so use a recent demand window to capture current regime. I choose recent_N for L using the last 5 observed lead times to reflect current variability, and recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent higher-demand regime and volatility. These parameters raise base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma informed by recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=299 (large pipeline but many prior orders remained unconcluded \u2192 possible lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 2, occasional 1 and one 3); recent concluded lead times average ~2.2 so I use recent_N for L to reflect recent variability. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 7 demand samples to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce influence of older low-demand periods. Sigma uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These choices aim to raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering despite some lost shipments that the OR engine cannot see.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand 0, in-transit 291. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with many delayed/unconcluded shipments; using observed average lead time (calculate) better reflects reality than blind promised LT=2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (sustained +34%); recent weeks (Periods 26\u201332) show elevated demand (~87 units/week). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (the most recent 7 demand observations) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, capturing the sustained higher demand while keeping responsiveness to recent variability. This approach plus using calculated L helps the OR engine size orders to cover the longer/variable effective lead time and higher demand, mitigating stockouts from delayed shipments while controlling holding cost given low holding $1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=318; several earlier orders remained unconcluded indicating probable lost/delayed shipments, so be conservative on lead-time estimate. Observed concluded lead_times = [2,2,1,2,1,2,2,3,2,2,1] (avg \u22481.82) \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L based on observed history. Demand increased starting Period 11 (sustained); to capture the new regime use recent demand (most recent regime) with N=20 (cap) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock accounts for higher mean and recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by focusing on the confirmed higher-demand regime while using empirically observed lead time.

Observed concluded lead times (11 samples) average \u22481.82, close to promised 2 but variable; use calculated average to reflect observed variability. For demand we use a recent_N window to capture the post-changepoint regime (use max recent regime data up to 20 weeks) so the backend bases base_stock on the higher recent mean. Sigma uses the same recent_N to reflect current volatility. These choices aim to keep service high for the sustained higher-demand regime while the calculated L accounts for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline prevents over-ordering.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=306. Historical concluded lead times are variable (observed samples: 12 concluded shipments with mean \u22481.92 periods) and several shipments remain unarrived long past promised LT, so use an empiric average lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 11 (recent avg \u2248 +34% vs earlier). To capture the elevated recent demand and its volatility, use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N chosen = min(regime_length,20)=20). These settings (L by calculate; mu_hat/sigma_hat by recent_N) bias orders toward recent higher demand while the OR backend will compute safety stock via service-level formula; using recent data mitigates understock risk from the confirmed demand increase and variable lead times while avoiding excessive static increases to holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=279. Historical concluded lead times show high variability (observed LT sample includes 1\u20133 periods; several recent orders concluded with LT=3 and multiple orders remain long-unconcluded suggesting lost/delayed shipments). Demand has shifted up vs early-year baseline; recent weekly demands (Periods ~30\u201336) are elevated (~80\u2013110 range). To respond I use recent_N estimators to capture the most recent lead-time variability and elevated demand while keeping the OR engine aware of current pipeline: recent_N for L uses last 7 observed lead times to reflect recent variability; mu_hat recent_N (N=7) uses last 7 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand under the current higher regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) uses recent volatility to size safety stock. This approach adapts to the sustained higher demand and variable/occasionally long lead times, and helps the backend set a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while acknowledging possible delayed/lost shipments given existing in-transit stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=340 \u2014 substantial pipeline but previous history shows variable and sometimes multi-period delays. Recent concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); to be responsive to recent variability I set L using recent lead-time observations. Demand has been elevated since the regime shift identified at Period 11; the most recent 7 weekly demands (Periods 31\u201337) average ~82 units/week, so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on those 7 recent samples to capture the current higher demand and volatility. These choices keep the backend base-stock tuned to the higher recent demand while letting L reflect recent delivery variability so orders won\u2019t be oversized if effective lead time shortens.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime has been higher since Period 11 (recent avg ~77 vs earlier ~57). On-hand=0, in-transit=279 (some past orders likely delayed/lost given many unconcluded shipments). Lead times observed vary (1\u20133); I provide an inferred average lead time for the OR engine and use recent-demand estimates to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. L: use calculated average of observed lead times to reflect empirical variability. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=20) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 20 demand periods after the detected shift. sigma_hat: use recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility. These choices increase replenishment to meet the sustained higher demand while the averaged lead time accounts for variable arrivals and helps avoid under-ordering given delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=308; multiple prior orders remained unconcluded for long periods indicating lost/delayed shipments\u2014we must be cautious but use observed lead-time history. Set L using aggregated observed lead times (calculate) to let backend infer typical LT from concluded shipments. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (recent mean ~77); use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained regime while limiting N to 20. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent high-demand regime) while letting OR cap orders via its cap constraint to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=308 units\u2014pipeline is large relative to typical weekly demand, but many past shipments showed variable and occasionally long/failed lead times. Use calculated average lead time from observed concluded shipments to capture the true LT distribution rather than trusting promised LT. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11; to reflect recent higher demand I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (last 7 concluded demand observations) so mu_hat and sigma_hat respond to the sustained +34% demand shift while keeping safety stock moderate given high in-transit inventory. These choices balance service (capture elevated demand) vs holding cost (cap on orders applied by OR backend and large existing pipeline reduces new order size).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand regime confirmed (shift at Period 11) with higher mean demand vs earlier sample; current on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times (15 samples) average \u22481.93 periods so use calculated average lead time to capture slight deviation from promised=2. For demand I use a recent_N estimate anchored on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11+); per policy cap N at 20 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while reducing influence of older low-demand data. Sigma uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward a base-stock sized for the higher recent demand while using the empirically observed lead time and measured recent volatility to balance service level against holding cost given the substantial pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 large pipeline present but many past shipments were delayed/lost historically; recent concluded lead times vary (1\u20133). Recent demand shows a large one-week spike at Period 42 (268) likely promotional/seasonal (Black Friday) but not yet a sustained regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent_N for both lead time and demand estimates to adapt to current volatility while limiting horizon: L -> recent_N N=5 to capture the last 5 observed lead times (reflecting 1\u20133 variability); mu_hat -> recent_N N=5 to let the backend scale (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 demands (captures elevated recent demand); sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices allow the OR engine to raise target stock for the recent high-demand environment while staying responsive to lead-time variability and avoiding excessive long-term holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). SKU 554450036 has on-hand=0, in-transit=561. Historical concluded lead times are mixed (observed values include 1\u20133 periods) with mean \u22481.9, and recent demand has been elevated since Period 11 (previously noted +34% regime shift). Several orders remain unarrived historically, but concluded LT evidence centers near 2. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=19, holding=1 \u2192 high service target), I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (~2). For demand and volatility I choose default (use all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, letting the OR engine compute the base-stock while respecting the capped order. This keeps targets responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while relying on full-sample stats rather than short-window noise given intermittent lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=561. Historical concluded lead_times average \u22482 but show variability (1\u20133) and some lost/delayed shipments; recent demand shows elevated level with a large spike at Period 42 (Black Friday week) but the spike is not yet a sustained multi-period regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-time conclusions so the backend captures actual average LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current elevated demand/volatility across the last 7 weeks (Periods 38\u201344) so the base-stock covers the near-term holiday surge. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=7) to reflect increased recent demand variability. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts during holiday spike) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand and confirmed lead-time evidence.

Demand regime shifted up around Period 11 and has remained elevated; to capture recent demand level I use a recent-window estimate. L: use calculate to let backend set L to the average of observed lead times (matches promised=2). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime data and capture sustained higher demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service level high (profit/holding => q\u22480.95) while avoiding further overreaction to single extreme events (e.g., Period 42 spike) by using a 20-period recent sample.
