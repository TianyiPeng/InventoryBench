  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=311 and in-transit=742 gives pipeline+on-hand=1,053 units. Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 30 (weeks ~11\u201337, average \u224822.4/week), so expected demand over (L+1)=3 periods \u224867 units. Lead time has been variable/delayed historically (carry-over notes) so some in-transit may be late but pipeline is still overwhelmingly larger than near-term need. OR recommends 0 (uses promised L and historical data); given very high inventory relative to projected near-term demand and holding cost = profit (q=0.5), placing any order increases holding cost without improving profit. Action: do not order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and let pipeline clear.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order\u2014on-hand+in-transit (1,053) far exceeds 3-period demand (~67); holding cost equals profit, so avoid extra inventory.",
