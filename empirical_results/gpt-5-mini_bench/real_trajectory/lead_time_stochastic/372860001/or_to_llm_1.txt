Lead-time reality: history shows inconsistent and delayed arrivals (some orders from early periods remained overdue and shipments have mixed lead times), so actual lead time is unreliable; however the large in-transit balance (995) should cover the next (L+1) periods of expected demand even if a subset of earlier orders are delayed.
