Historical demand samples: [18,20,99,72,68], overall mean=55.4, recent 3-period avg (post-2019-01-21) =79.7 (carry-over insight already recorded). Promised lead time=2 (orders placed now arrive in Period N+2), so we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand including current period. OR recommended 142. OR's math (using overall mean) yields base-stock \u2248218, order_raw \u2248104 (given pipeline=114), cap \u2248114, but OR output is 142 (capped policy + its parameters). Adjustment reasoning: Recent demand has clearly shifted upward (recent avg \u224879.7 vs overall 55.4, about +44%). Using the recent mean implies expected 3-period demand ~239, so current pipeline (114) is likely insufficient if the higher regime persists. There is some risk the in-transit 114 could be delayed/lost, but we have only one period of non-arrival which is consistent with promised L=2, so don\u2019t assume loss yet. Action decision: increase order above OR's implicit uncapped calculation but slightly below OR's 142 recommendation to balance higher-demand protection vs holding cost. I order 125 units to raise pipeline+new order to 239 units (114 in-transit +125 ordered =239), which matches the 3-period demand implied by the recent higher-demand regime while limiting extra holding.

This is insufficient evidence to definitively change the promised lead-time assumption (requires sustained 3+ period signal), but it raises risk that some or all of the 239 in-transit units may not arrive on schedule. Demand & seasonality: Recent carry-over insight reports a demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (avg of last 3 samples = 79.7 vs overall avg 55.4, +43.8%), so short-term demand is higher than long-run mean.

Decision logic: Given elevated recent demand and the risk that some in-transit units may be delayed/lost, we need to replenish but avoid excessive over-ordering given holding cost=$1/unit and profit=$4/unit.
