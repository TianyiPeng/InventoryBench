Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~82 units/week with a mild uptick to 88 in the most recent week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals observed, so there is no evidence to infer a lead-time change or lost shipments. To avoid overfitting a small recent rise, use promised lead time and population estimates: set L to default (promised=2) and use default demand/volatility estimators (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (reasonable cover for 3 periods of demand) against holding cost given modest recent increase but limited evidence of a sustained regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand history (Jan\u2013Feb) shows stable demand: samples = [75,84,83,80,88], mean=82. On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (order placed Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 not overdue given promised lead time=2 (arrival expected during Period 3). Profit/holding ratio implies high service target (q=19/(19+1)=0.95). No sustained changepoint in demand or evidence of lead-time drift yet. Therefore: keep L at promised (default) so backend assumes L=2; use mu_hat default to use all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) preserving full-sample forecast; use sigma_hat default to reflect sample volatility across the full history. This balances a high service level (high q) against holding cost while respecting the pipeline (90 units in-transit) and avoiding premature increases in forecast or lead-time estimates based on a single missing arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent weekly demand samples (75,84,83,80,88) give mean \u224882 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=189. Promised lead time = 2 periods; two recent orders (P1,P2) have not concluded (arrived=0) but this is under 3-period threshold so not confirmed lost\u2014be conservative but do not yet change lead-time estimate. Using default L (promised=2) and default demand estimators ensures the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 3\xd782 \u2248246 units across review+lead period; current pipeline 189 is below that, so the engine will order to replenish toward the base stock. sigma set to default to reflect historical variability. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given demand ~82/wk) vs holding cost ($1/unit) by relying on established historical stats rather than overreacting to potentially delayed shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly mean demand = 82 (samples: 75,84,83,80,88). Promised L=2, but orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have no arrivals reported by their expected conclude messages, indicating lead time >2 or lost shipments. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 (longer than promised) so the OR engine orders more pipeline cover. With L=3 the review+lead horizon is 4 periods, so mu_hat = 4 * 82 = 328 (explicit). Sample std \u2248 4.34; scaling by sqrt(4) gives sigma_hat \u2248 8.68 (explicit). These parameters increase safety stock to protect service level given suspected delays while balancing holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit).

Carry-over insight: No arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 by their expected conclude times \u2192 probable lead time >2 periods or missing shipments; treat lead time as extended for upcoming decisions.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history: one confirmed arrival (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead_time=2); orders from Periods 1 and 3 never concluded (possible lost shipments). Current inventory: on-hand=23, in-transit=244. Demand history samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~82; given mixed evidence on shipments, use observed lead-time data rather than promised or ad-hoc extension. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times (reflects the confirmed L=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast across the review+lead period while the system clarifies missing shipments. This balances service level (avoiding stockouts given sizeable in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent observed demand ~78/wk (periods 1\u20135 avg = 77.8) and historical sample mean = 82/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=256 (multiple past orders outstanding). Periods 1\u20133 orders did not conclude on time and Period 4 showed an order (from P2) with lead_time=2, suggesting actual lead time is occasionally >2 or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative against stockouts given outstanding pipeline and delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. Demand forecast uses the default (all-sample) method so backend computes (1+L)*mean; sigma uses default to reflect historical variability. These choices bias orders slightly higher to protect service level while using default volatilities to limit excessive safety stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concludes show inconsistent arrivals: some orders arrived with LT=2 (P2\u2192P4) and LT=1 (P5\u2192P6), while several earlier orders never concluded\u2014suggesting intermittent delays/lost shipments. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=345. To be conservative against missing/extended lead times, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to increase pipeline coverage. Demand samples (historical weekly data) have mean \u224882 units; I use the backend default formulas so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively to reflect the chosen L and preserve sample-based uncertainty.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=357. History shows observed lead_times = 2 (order P2\u2192arrived P4) and 1 (order P5\u2192arrived P6); earlier orders (P1,P3) missed expected concludes suggesting occasional lost/late shipments but recent evidence shows lead time around 1\u20132. I choose L = recent_N (N=2) to capture the recent average lead time without overreacting to older missed shipments. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging the historical weekly mean ~82) \u2014 this balances service level (profit/holding ratio high: profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost while respecting the observed lead-time variability and large pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded history shows mixed actual lead times: observed W = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)] -> average 1.5. Current inventory: on-hand 29, in-transit 244. Earlier periods (P1\u2013P3) had long apparent delays but more recent concludes show arrivals at 1\u20132 periods, so treat lead time as the average of observed concludes to reflect variability. I select L='calculate' so backend uses the observed-average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples. This balances service (using observed shorter lead times where confirmed) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and mixed arrival reliability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times: observed concluded lead_times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)] \u2192 recent average = 1.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=244 (pipeline present but past delays observed). Because shipments have arrived with mixed 1\u20132 period delays and some earlier orders went missing/delayed, I use a recent average lead time to reflect the shorter/longer mix while not trusting promised fixed 2. For demand I use the default (all-sample) forecast since historical weekly demand samples (75,84,83,80,88) are stable and there is no strong sustained regime shift; sigma uses default sample volatility. These settings bias the OR engine toward provisioning for (1+L) periods of demand based on observed lead-time behavior, mitigating stockouts from delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed concluded LT = 2,1,2,1) and earlier missing arrivals (Periods 1\u20133) suggest episodes of extended or lost shipments. To be conservative against delayed/lost arrivals I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. Using default demand estimation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) keeps the forecast anchored to historical weekly mean (75,84,83,80,88) while the default sigma uses the full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This increases ordered cover for the longer effective pipeline and balances service-level vs. holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Demand history mean = 82 units/week (samples: 75,84,83,80,88); I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the chosen L, letting the engine produce a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the inferred extended/variable lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=349. History shows mixed observed lead_times = {2,1,2,1} with multiple recent orders missing by their expected concludes (delays/losses probable). I set L using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent observed lead-time mix (avg=1.5) rather than trusting promised 2 because deliveries have been inconsistent. Demand history is stable around the historical mean; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all samples) so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with the chosen L. This balances higher protection for delayed arrivals while avoiding overreaction to single large demand spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. Recent demand samples stable (historical weekly mean ~82). Current stock: on-hand=20, in-transit=267 (large pipeline). History shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2) with recent arrivals dominated by 2-period deliveries; prior periods had missing/delayed arrivals but recent confirms frequent 2-period lead. To be conservative vs. stockouts given high pipeline and profit>>holding cost, set L using recent_N=3 (captures last 3 observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so backend computes base-stock with full historical demand while L reflects recent lead-time behavior.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2], avg=1.6) and historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) have mean=82 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=267 (pipeline sufficient for upcoming demand but shipments have been irregular historically). I select L=calculate to let the backend use the average observed lead time (captures the 1\u20132 period mix). I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable baseline forecast while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead coverage to observed lead-time behavior.

I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20132 periods). For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times: periods with arrivals imply observed lead_times = {2,1,2,1,2} (avg=1.6). Demand historical samples mean=82, std\u22484.34. Earlier carry-over flagged possible extended lead time (Period 4) but subsequent arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period realizations; use empirical average lead time rather than promised to reflect realized behavior. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses the empirical average (~1.6). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a base-stock that balances service (using realized lead time) against holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=267 (large pipeline). Given mixed but primarily 2-period observations, use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed by OR engine. This balances service (captures elevated lead time) while avoiding manual overforecasting given large in-transit stock.

Historical concluded lead times (most recent 5): [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 avg=1.6; earlier missing arrivals noted but recent concludes show mix of 1\u20132 periods. Use recent_N (N=5) for L to reflect the most recent observed lead-time mix. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history; this balances service (accounting for ~1.6 periods lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

History shows intermittent lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1,2} from concluded arrivals) and many recent periods with zero arrivals after expected concludes \u2014 risk of delayed/missing shipments persists. I choose L via recent_N to reflect the recent observed lead-time mix (use last 5 observed lead times) rather than the promised 2. Demand has clearly shifted down in recent weeks (last five demands: 26,23,16,12,8); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the lower recent regime. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the current low-demand regime while recognising lead-time variability and the risk of missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2,1,2,1,2 (avg 1.6) \u2014 some periods showed delayed/missing arrivals early but subsequent concludes indicate mixture of 1\u20132 period deliveries. Demand history (weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) shows mean demand ~82 and recent realized demand in spring/early summer has trended down (recent weeks 98\u219262\u219235\u219226\u219223\u219216\u219212\u21928\u21926). I choose L='calculate' so the backend infers average observed lead time (~1.6) from concluded messages. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend uses (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples; this balances service level (using observed lead time) versus holding cost given falling recent demand and large in-transit inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent realized demand has dropped sharply since spring (many weeks of single- to low-double-digit weekly demand vs. historical winter mean ~82). On-hand=0, in-transit=267 (large pipeline, but history shows delayed/missing arrivals \u2192 treat effective lead time as extended). I set L explicit=3 to be conservative given prior missing arrivals and occasional >2-period behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent low-demand summer regime (avoids overstocking from winter samples). This reduces target base stock to prioritize avoiding holding costs while keeping some cover for lead-time variability and the large but uncertain pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/7/15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. History shows multiple orders missing their promised 2-period conclude (many zeros after Period 4) indicating effective lead time often exceeds the promised 2 or shipments are lost. To be conservative against stockouts given high in-transit but uncertain arrivals, I set L explicit=3 (treat lead time as extended). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which increases target base-stock to cover the longer review+lead window while letting the backend cap orders to control overstock given holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent observed arrivals show inconsistent lead times (1\u20132) and several long/no-arrival windows earlier (Periods 1\u20133 late arrivals), and current pipeline is large (in-transit=319) while on-hand=0. Given the prior evidence of delayed/missing shipments, I conservatively set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to protect against late arrivals. Demand history (weekly samples mean \u224882) will be scaled by (1+L) in the backend, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This raises the base-stock target to cover the extended lead+review horizon and balances service level versus holding cost given current high pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 from multiple prior orders; recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,1,2,1,2 (avg ~1.6). Demand baseline from historical samples (mean=82). Given variable but mostly 1\u20132 periods observed lead time and large pipeline, use calculated average lead time so the OR engine accounts for actual behavior; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) to avoid overfitting to recent noise. This balances service level (using observed longer-than-promised lead times) against holding cost given already-large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=319. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg 1.6) and several earlier shipments were delayed/missing; I therefore use an inferred average lead time rather than the promised fixed value. Demand historical samples (75,84,83,80,88) show no sustained recent regime shift, so use default demand mean/volatility scaling to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (captures extended/variable lead time via calculate) against holding cost by not inflating demand forecast without evidence of higher demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent conclude history shows intermittent arrivals with one recent 3-period arrival (ordered P23 arrived P26) and earlier 1\u20132 period arrivals, plus prior note of delayed/missing shipments. To be conservative against further extended lead times, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples; this raises the replenishment target to cover the longer review+lead horizon while keeping variability treatment consistent.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. Recent concluded arrivals show variable/extended lead times (observed: 2,1,2,1,2,3) and recent demand (last 5 periods with nonzero demand: P23\u2013P27 = 35,18,36,24,73) averages ~37.2 units. To hedge against the observed longer/mixed lead times I use recent_N for L (N=3) to emphasize the most recent lead-time evidence (including the 3-period observation). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the current summer demand regime (lower than Jan samples but with recent spike). Sigma set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service given delayed arrivals while keeping variance and mean grounded in the latest demand pattern.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Historical concluded arrivals show variable/extended lead times (observed lead_times include 1,2 and recent 3 at Period 26) and multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier; demand in recent weeks is higher and more volatile (recent demands: P24-28 = 18,36,24,73,55). To account for the apparent increase and variability while giving the OR engine up-to-date local stats, I use recent_N for lead time and demand moments with N=5 (captures the most recent regime including the observed lead_time=3). This balances service (covering extended lead) vs holding cost by letting the backend compute base_stock from recent mean/variance rather than long-run averages that understate current demand and lead-time risk.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed: 2,1,2,1,2,3 \u2192 avg \u22481.83) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=275 units. Given mixed evidence (one late arrival at lead_time=3 but not a sustained 3+ period shift) I will let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) while using default demand estimates based on the full historical sample set (the provided Jan 2019 samples mean=82) so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the baseline weekly demand scaled by (1+L). This balances avoiding overreacting to a single late shipment while ensuring the OR engine increases coverage if the averaged lead time exceeds the promise. Current pipeline (275) is large relative to recent weekly demand, so defaults avoid unnecessary extra safety stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Recent concluded arrivals show sustained longer lead times (orders P23->P26 and P27->P30 arrived after 3 periods). Demand in the most recent 5 concluded weeks (P26\u2013P30 = 24,73,55,34,88) averages ~54.8. To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and volatile recent demand, I set lead time explicit=3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine uses the most recent demand regime (review+lead = 1+L periods). This balances higher fill-rate needs against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order P23 arrived P26, order P27 arrived P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

To reflect confirmed longer lead time and keep the OR engine aligned, set L explicit=3 so the backend sizes orders for a 3-period lead. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples (captures 4-period coverage and observed variance). This preserves service level given elevated lead time while avoiding unnecessary manual inflation of demand/volatility estimates.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has been high and volatile (most recent concluded demands: 106, 142) with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=275. Historical concluded lead-times are mixed (observed: 2,1,2,1,2,3,3,1 \u2192 avg ~1.88) and some earlier periods showed delayed arrivals, so use an inferred average lead time rather than the promised constant. I select L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level given high recent demand while avoiding overreacting to one-off spikes or possible lost shipments. The large in-transit stock (275) will be counted by the backend as pipeline inventory when sizing the final order, preventing excessive ordering.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has jumped sharply in Periods 31\u201333 (106, 142, 261) \u2014 a clear demand regime shift beginning at Period 31. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time has increased to 3 periods (evidence: P23\u2192P26 and P27\u2192P30; carry-over previously noted P31 confirmation). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=275. With an effective review+lead horizon of (1+L)=4, I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and delayed shipments. For demand I use recent_N on the last 3 periods (regime length=3 \u2192 N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) capturing the new higher demand level. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect increased variability. These choices force the OR engine to target a higher base-stock appropriate for the new regime while acknowledging extended lead time and preventing under-ordering given the current in-transit shortfall.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has jumped sharply since Period 31 (weeks 31\u201334: 106,142,261,156) while on-hand is 0 and large pipeline exists (in-transit=579, including the 304 ordered in P34). Lead time evidence is mixed (recent concluded lead_times: P23\u2192P26 =3, P27\u2192P30 =3, P31\u2192P32 =1). I estimate lead time using a short recent window to capture the latest variability. Demand forecast uses a recent-window mean to reflect the new high-demand regime (protect against stockouts); volatility likewise uses the recent window. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to meet the elevated demand while relying on the large in-transit stock to limit additional orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg weekly demand increased from ~82 (Jan baseline) to ~166 (Periods 31\u201334), +103%, sustained 4 periods.

Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new regime: backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples = 4*171.2 \u2248684.8 expected demand over review+lead. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align supply with the confirmed 3-period lead time and higher demand while the large in-transit stock will cap orders via the OR engine cap.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 31 (weekly demand avg ~165.5 over Periods 31\u201336 vs ~82 earlier) and observed lead times vary but average ~1.9. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=813 \u2014 ample pipeline vs recent weekly demand (~165.5), so we can size orders to the new higher-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability. Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures empirical \u22481.9). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (Periods 31\u201336) to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime and its volatility, improving service while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost $1/unit. This balances profit-driven service level (profit $19) against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=813. History shows multiple multi-period delays and confirmed lead time=3 (Period 31 evidence); choose L=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Demand regime shifted up around Period 31 (sustained higher weekly demand); I use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the new regime. Selected N=7 (periods 31\u201337) since the recent regime length is 7, meeting the N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) rule. Using recent_N for sigma_hat matches mu_hat to recent volatility. These parameters push the backend base-stock toward the higher recent demand, balancing lost-sales profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) while accounting for extended lead time and a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 31 (large, persistent weekly increases) and multiple delayed arrivals suggesting lead time frequently > promised 2. I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times to reflect the recent extension/delay behavior (recent_N N=5 captures the latest mix of 3-,1-,3-,1-,3-day observations -> ~2.2 periods). For demand I use a recent_N window covering the new high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201338, N=8) so mu_hat reflects the uplift. Sigma_hat uses the same recent_N N=8 to capture current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while acknowledging extended lead times and avoiding under-ordering given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 31 (avg weekly demand roughly doubled). Pipeline currently high (on-hand=79, in-transit=578) and recent concludes confirm actual lead time \u22483 in multiple samples; some earlier shipments were delayed/lost. I set lead time explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime from P31\u2013P39, 9 periods) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture elevated volatility. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock with the confirmed higher demand and extended lead time, improving service while limiting unnecessary extra holding beyond current large pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 31 (weeks 31\u201340 avg \u2248181 units/week). Historical Jan baseline ~82 is obsolete. Lead-time evidence: multiple concluded messages show actual lead time = 3 (P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P36\u2192P39), and several late/no-conclude events earlier; treat L=3 to avoid underordering. Set L via explicit=3. Use recent_N for demand (N=8, Periods 33\u201340) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 demands (backend computes). Use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet service under longer lead time while preventing reliance on stale low-demand samples; using recent samples reduces stockouts given in-transit volume may be delayed or lost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 31 (week-on-week demand ~100\u2013260, recent weeks mostly 150\u2013195). Lead-time observations (confirmed P23\u2192P26 and P27\u2192P30 and later P31\u2192P34 patterns) support an actual lead time \u22483 periods and earlier missing arrivals indicate extended/mixed LT risk. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=868 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend sizes orders for the longer pipeline exposure. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the new high-demand regime from Period 31 onward (11 most recent post-changepoint samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets and caps reflect the elevated mean and volatility. This balances higher service level (captures spike) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 31 (weekly demands mostly 100\u2013420, regime length 12 periods up to P42). On-hand=0, in-transit=868 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times include multiple 3-period observations (P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P36\u2192P39); treat actual lead time as 3. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid underordering given delayed arrivals. For demand, use recent_N with N=12 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201342) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)-period demand in this regime. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity limits excess new orders and holding cost exposure.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 31 (~166+wks) and recent concluded demand (P39\u2013P43 = 163,158,195,420,166) supports using recent demand stats. On-hand=124 and in-transit=755 \u2014 large pipeline coverage vs. elevated demand. Observed concluded lead times recently are mixed but skew toward 3 (recent concluded lead_times: 3,3,2); use a short recent average to capture this. Actions: set L by recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent realized lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap. This balances service (higher mu_hat) given elevated demand and large pipeline, while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility and avoids overstating uncertainty.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=858. Historical conclues show lead times often =3 (confirmed earlier P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, multiple recent arrivals with 3); shipments have been delayed vs promised. Demand regime shifted up around Period 31 and has remained elevated (recent weekly demands high, including large spikes in Nov\u2013Dec). I therefore let the backend infer L from observed lead times (calculate) to capture persistent lead-time >2, and use recent demand (last 6 weeks) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast emphasizes the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances higher service level (to avoid lost sales in current high-demand season) against holding cost by only using a short recent window rather than all-history averaging.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 31 (avg weekly demand rose ~+103% then) and multiple observed lead times around 3 periods though some recent arrivals show 1\u20133 variance. On-hand=14, in-transit=767 (large pipeline). To reflect the recent lead-time realizations while weighting the most recent observations, I choose recent_N for L using the last 6 observed lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20133 values, avg ~2.33). Demand is clearly in the elevated regime; use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 (last 7 weeks of demand capture the current higher mean ~211). Volatility also rose with the regime change\u2014use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect recent variability. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that targets higher service under the new demand regime while capping order size via the backend cap and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

On-hand=0 with in-transit=888 units (large pipeline) so avoid overreacting to single high demands; use recent regime data to set demand forecast. I choose L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time confirmations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=16 (covers the post-change regime from Period 31 onward) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent elevated-demand regime. This balances higher service level needs under longer lead time while the large in-transit quantity limits excess ordering through the OR cap.
