Demand outlook: Recent weeks (Period 43\u201346) show elevated demand consistent with a December seasonal peak (166, 211, 163, 87), recent 3-period average \u2248147 units/week \u2192 (L+1)=3 period demand \u2248441 units. OR recommendation = 0 (uses promised L and historical baseline); given high profit/holding fractile leads to high target stock but current pipeline already far exceeds 3-period demand, ordering would only increase holding cost. Risk check: carry-over notes indicate unreliable pipeline historically, but despite some lost shipments we observe large concluded arrivals in Periods 41\u201345 and current visible in-transit=804; conservative action still favors no new order to avoid excess holding cost while consuming the backlog. Final action: order 0 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order\u2014on-hand (1333) + in-transit (804)=2137 far exceeds (L+1)=3 period demand (~441), so following OR's 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs.",
