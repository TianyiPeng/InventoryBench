Product: womens trousers; moderate seasonality with peaks earlier in year. Demand analysis: recent observed weekly demand has been low (Periods 41\u201346: 19,83,35,32,15,13 with last six weeks mostly low single/double digits except one 83). Historical high-demand episodes (Aug/Sep) are in the past and not currently repeating. Lead time / pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=700. Recent history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20132) and occasional lost shipments, but the system currently reports 700 in-transit (tied to prior orders). Inventory assessment & risk: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1 per unit/period \u2014 holding inventory one period roughly erases profit; therefore avoid receiving excess inventory before demonstrable demand. Action logic: do not place additional orders this period so we avoid extra holding cost while the large in-transit quantity can satisfy upcoming demand or reveal actual arrival timing.",
