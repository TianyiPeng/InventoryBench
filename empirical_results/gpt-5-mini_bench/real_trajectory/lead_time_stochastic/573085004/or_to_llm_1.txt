{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Promised L=2 but history shows variable/long lead times and several lost shipments (P1,P4,P26 flagged). In-transit=1114 likely overstates available future arrivals; only concluded arrivals are reliable. Inventory & demand: On-hand=385 which, given recent weekly demand mostly in the 10\u201380 range (last 6 weeks: 13,13,15,32,35,83), is sufficient to cover the upcoming (L+1) periods without new arrivals. Costs: profit=$1 and holding=$1 \u2192 stocking extra units yields no net expected margin benefit versus holding cost; OR also recommends 0. Decision: place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost and let on-hand absorb near-term demand while we continue to observe concluded arrivals to reassess true pipeline and lead time.",
