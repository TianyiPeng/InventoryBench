Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 712216001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013early Feb) show no sustained changepoint; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. To avoid overfitting with limited data and because promised lead time is 2, use defaults so backend computes L=promised and mu/sigma from all samples. This balances service vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand mean \u224885.6 from provided samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (order placed Period 1). Seeing arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised lead time=2 (arrival will occur during Period 3 resolution and be visible in Period 3 conclude). No evidence of lost or extended lead time yet and no sustained demand regime change (only five historical samples, no recent changepoint). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations, balancing service level vs holding cost under promised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Historical weekly mean demand = 85.6 (samples 2019-01). No confirmed lead-time change (insufficient concluded arrivals) and no sustained demand regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given current pipeline while avoiding premature increases to targets despite missing concludes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (mean=85.6) used. Concluded history shows no arrivals over three consecutive conclude messages (Period1 ordered=120 arrived=0; Period2 ordered=117 arrived=0; Period3 ordered=31 arrived=0) \u2014 a sustained delivery failure. To protect service I set lead time explicitly to 3 (treat shipments as delayed/lost). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using L=3, increasing target base-stock to cover the longer review+lead period while the cap still limits order size.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (120, 117, 31) produced no arrivals by Period 4 conclude \u2014 sustained delivery failure; treat actual lead time as >=3 (use L=3) until evidence to the contrary.

Daily Profit: $104.00, Daily Holding Cost: $13.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent history shows sustained delivery failures: orders in Periods 1-3 produced no arrivals by Period 4 conclude; Period 2 order did arrive in Period 4 (lead_time=2) but earlier shipments remained delayed\u2014treat lead time as longer. On-hand=13, in-transit=241 (total pipeline=254) vs. historical weekly mean ~85.6; (1+L) periods demand with L=3 implies (1+L)=4 \u2192 target demand coverage \u2248342 units, so pipeline is currently short. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delays; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand-over-review+lead from full sample statistics (conservative smoothing). This increases target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and mitigates stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concludes show sustained delivery failures for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (no arrivals by P4 conclude) and a confirmed arrival for Period 2 order arriving in Period 4 (lead_time observed=2 for that one), but multiple lost/delayed shipments imply actual lead time >=3 for now. On-hand=0, in-transit=352. I set L explicitly to 3 to protect against further hidden delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the last five observed weekly demands (P1-P5: 91,106,91,104,93) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 5) and sigma_hat using recent volatility over the same window. This raises target base-stock to cover 4 weeks of demand given longer lead time while keeping variance estimate recent to avoid overreacting to older Jan samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent history shows earlier multi-period non-arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders missing by Period 4 conclude) indicating longer-than-promised delivery; later arrivals show variability (observed lead times 1 and 2). On-hand=62, in-transit=277. To be conservative against lost/delayed shipments, set L explicitly to 3 (treat actual lead time >=3 until contrary evidence). Use default demand scaling so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), allowing the OR engine to size base-stock for a 4-period demand window while respecting observed demand history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Historical concl: multiple orders (P1-3) failed to arrive on time; P2 order observed with lead_time=2, P5 arrived with lead_time=1, and several recent late/no arrivals indicate unstable fulfillment. On-hand=0, in-transit=288. Given sustained missing arrivals earlier and the carry-over direction to treat lead time as longer, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 observed weekly demands: P3-P7) to capture the recent regime including a drop in periods 6-7; backend will scale mu_hat by (1+L). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices (longer explicit L and recent-based demand/volatility) protect against underordering given delivery delays while avoiding excessive stock from older high-demand periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand volatile with a recent high (114) but overall recent-5 mean \u224884.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=273 but history shows lost/delayed shipments in early periods and carry-over insight that actual lead time >=3; therefore set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (Periods 4\u20138 demands = 104,93,49,62,114; mean \u224884.4) so the OR backend sizes base stock for the (1+L) review+lead window while reflecting recent volatility. This addresses missing shipments by using an explicit longer lead time and recent demand statistics to avoid underordering or excess holding.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Historical concludes show multiple delayed/lost arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders absent until P4) \u2014 treat lead time as extended. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained delivery failure signal; this increases safety-cover in the (1+L) demand window. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L), letting the backend compute base_stock and the capped order given the updated L and available pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent conclude history shows multiple delayed/no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 and subsequent variability in observed lead times (observed lead times include 1 and 2 but also multiple missed arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=253. Given sustained delivery failures (orders from early periods did not arrive by their promised windows) I set lead time explicitly to 3 to protect against understocking. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (captures full-sample demand signal while the explicit L addresses delivery risk). This raises recommended base-stock to cover an extra review+lead horizon, trading higher holding for reduced stockouts given current pipeline uncertainty.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/29 (Period 12). Recent conclude history shows multiple delayed/missing arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders did not arrive by Period 4 conclude) indicating sustained delivery failures; on-hand=0, in-transit=353. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the observed >=3-period effective lead time and to avoid under-ordering given overdue shipments. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine increases review+lead demand and safety stock automatically under L=3, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 4: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (120, 117, 31) produced no arrivals by Period 4 conclude \u2014 sustained delivery failure; treat actual lead time as >=3 (use L=3) until evidence to the contrary.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=361; recent conclude history shows multiple delayed/lost arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders never arrived by P4 conclude and later patterns) so treat actual lead time as 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect sustained delivery delay. Demand recent samples (Periods 4-12: 104,93,49,62,114,85,99,121,76) show no clear abrupt regime change but meaningful variability; I use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 9 periods (captures current demand level while limiting influence of older data). This increases the review+lead demand estimate to cover (1+L) periods and uses recent volatility to set safety stock, balancing service (profit=holding so q=0.5) against holding cost under delayed deliveries.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been strong and variable (period demands since start ranged ~49\u2013121). On-hand=48, in-transit=261 (some earlier shipments were delayed/lost). Historical conclude messages confirm inconsistent lead times and a sustained delivery failure for orders in Periods 1\u20133; therefore I treat actual lead time as longer than the promised 2 and set L explicitly to 3. Given limited stable evidence of a demand regime shift (recent demands match historical sample scale), use default demand estimates based on all samples: mu_hat default => (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to let the OR engine compute the forecasted review+lead demand; sigma_hat default => sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect observed variability. This increases safety stock to cover the longer effective lead time while avoiding ad-hoc overreaction to recent noise.

======================================================================

To guard against longer actual lead time and avoid stockouts, set lead time to 3 (explicit). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=3; this raises order targets to cover the longer review+lead horizon while the capped cap limits excessive inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

History shows earlier sustained lost shipments (Periods 1\u20133) and uneven observed lead times; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover overdue/lost arrivals. Using default demand/volatility scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR backend compute base stock and cap consistently with L=3 while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy arrivals.

To be conservative given sustained delivery failures, set lead time L explicitly to 3. Use default demand forecasts (mu_hat: default, sigma_hat: default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while the longer L raises target cover for the extra delay and balances service vs. holding given profit=holding cost.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-4) showed sustained delivery failure for early orders; carry-over guidance: treat actual lead time as >=3 until contradicted. With large in-transit inventory but zero on-hand, I set lead time explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer pipeline visibility window. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples, preserving statistical grounding while the explicit L inflates the forecast horizon to cover 4 periods of demand. This balances service (avoid stockouts given detected longer lead time) against holding cost because in-transit is already large and the OR engine\u2019s capped ordering will limit new order sizes.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 Period 20. Recent history shows multiple delayed/lost shipments: orders from Periods 1-3 produced no arrivals by Period 4 conclude and carry-over notes treat actual lead time >=3; subsequent confirms of 2 sometimes occur but the earlier sustained failure justifies conservatively using L=3. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to size orders for the longer observed delivery horizon. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples using the explicit L=3; this lets the engine balance service vs holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Earlier multi-period delivery failure resolved in later concludes, so do not enforce extended L now. Set L=default (promised 2) to align with backend assumptions. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high mean and elevated volatility over the last 5 periods, improving service during the current demand surge while letting the OR engine apply its capped policy to limit over-ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=347. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) show a mix of 1 and 2 periods; recent observed lead times average \u22481.6. Demand historical sample mean (provided) is ~85.6/wk. Because recent concluded lead times are shorter than the earlier alarm (some late/missing arrivals in very early periods) I choose a recent average lead time to reflect the latest behavior while letting the backend use promised L in calculations where appropriate. I use recent_N for L (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (avg ~1.6), and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the full sample set. This balances service (by increasing L modestly above 1) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical conclude messages show sustained delivery failures earlier (orders from P1-3 missing until P4), so I treat actual lead time as 3 until contradicted. Set L explicitly=3 to ensure pipeline covers longer arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the most recent elevated-demand regime (captures periods 18-22), balancing service level vs. holding cost given high demand and longer lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=562 \u2014 large pipeline present. Recent concluded arrivals (Periods 4,6,8,10,13,14,17,19,22,23) show observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods (13 samples, mean\u22481.69). Earlier lost shipments (Periods 1\u20133) were a one-time failure; more recent evidence indicates shipments are typically arriving within 1\u20132 periods. Use calculated average lead time so backend learns from observed concludes; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine scales demand and uncertainty with the selected L. This balances service (using observed shorter lead times) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed \u22481.69 periods (13 concluded arrivals from Periods 4\u201323 show lead_times mostly 1\u20132); treat average lead time as ~2 unless future concludes show sustained change.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concludes (Periods 4\u201323) show most observed lead_times = 1\u20132 with average \u22481.69; earlier sustained failures occurred but later data indicate lead_time \u22482. On-hand=0, in-transit=562 (large pipeline). Use calculated average lead time to let backend formalize the observed average; use default demand and volatility priors so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently given the chosen L. This balances service (capture observed ~2-period lead) vs holding cost given large existing pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=562. Recent weeks (Periods ~19-25) show a sustained higher-demand regime (large spikes: 254,166,109,122,180,112) vs earlier baseline; pipeline is large but lead-time history shows variation with most concluded lead_times = 1\u20132 (average \u22481.7). I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (reduces influence of early low-demand weeks). This balances service (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent concluded arrivals (Periods 4\u201326) show most observed lead_times = 1\u20133 with average \u22482; keep L inferred from observations rather than promised. Demand has shifted upward in recent weeks (large spikes in Periods 19\u201325); use a recent-sample forecast to capture the higher current mean and volatility. Therefore set L via calculated average of observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the latest demand regime and limit dilution by older low-demand weeks. This balances service (capture recent high demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 with the last 5 observed lead times = [3,2,2,1,2] (avg=2.0). On-hand=125, in-transit=298 covers risk but recent demand has been spiking in summer (several weeks >150). To balance service vs holding cost I set lead time to recent average (last 5) so the OR engine sizes pipeline for realistic arrivals, and use recent demand/volatility (last 5 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding over-reaction to older low-demand weeks.

No sustained recent demand regime change vs. historical samples; use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand (Periods 25-29 = 112,83,56,59,54) averages ~72.8 with recent volatility; on-hand=12, in-transit=298 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead_times vary 1\u20133 and overall average ~1.7. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time (captures mixed 1\u20133 outcomes). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to base mu_hat on the most recent regime (covers last 5 weeks mean \u224872.8, scaled by 1+L in backend). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching recent demand while letting the backend convert to base-stock with observed average lead time, preventing overreaction to older spikes given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=298. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) with recent long arrivals earlier but overall average near 2; demand history has been volatile but no new sustained regime shift since Period 24. To let the backend use observed lead-time behaviour while keeping demand estimates generic given no clear recent changepoint, I request the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate) and use default demand mean/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (using observed average L) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline and avoids overreacting to isolated late arrivals.

There have been intermittent 3-period delays but most concludes are 1\u20132. Choose L by calculation to let backend use observed average lead-time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the full-sample demand estimate scaled by the inferred lead time; this balances service (given large pipeline) against holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline) so we must account for pipeline when ordering. Lead time history shows mixed 1\u20133 with average close to 2; use calculated average lead time so backend uses observed concludes.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks to low autumn weekly demand (last 5 concluded demands: 38,26,20,54,22 \u2192 mean \u2248 32). Historic concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20133; prior analysis averaged \u22481.69). In-transit = 298 units (large pipeline) so avoid inflating target stock. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed concluded lead times (best unbiased estimate given mixed 1\u20133 observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent low-demand regime (uses last 5 samples). For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) so variability matches the recent regime. These choices keep mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the recent drop in demand while L reflects empirically observed lead time, preventing over-ordering given the substantial in-transit quantity.

Historical concludes show mixed lead-times but overall recent evidence (Periods 4\u201326) supports an average lead time \u22482 (some lost/delayed earlier but later arrivals centered on 1\u20133). Given in-transit is large, and profit=holding cost, use the backend's lead-time estimator to reflect observed average. Select L by calculate so backend averages observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, which balances service level vs holding cost under the OR capped policy and accounts for the sizable pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Recent concluded lead-times (Periods 4\u201326) average ~1.7 (mostly 1\u20132, occasional 3); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed pattern. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 \u2014 sizable pipeline exists so avoid over-ordering. Demand has declined from summer peaks; the last 10 concluded weekly demands (Periods 27\u201336) show a lower regime (values: 56,59,54,38,26,20,54,22,11,11). I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-times history, mu_hat='recent_N' with N=10 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the recent lower-demand regime, and sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine toward smaller base stock consistent with lower recent demand while accounting for the observed lead-time distribution and the existing in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=298. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) and prior analysis summarized average lead_time \u22481.69; use calculated average lead time to let backend merge all observed concludes. Demand has fallen sharply since early Sep (Periods 30\u201337: [38,26,20,54,22,11,11,16] with lower recent mean). I choose recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime while letting the OR engine scale by (1+L). Using recent data reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit. These parameters balance service (reflecting observed lead times) versus holding cost (lower demand forecast, lower variability).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent observed demand has fallen from summer peaks to much lower weekly sales (Periods 30\u201338: 38,26,20,54,22,11,11,16,20). On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times average \u22481.7 (past concludes show mostly 1\u20132); use calculated average lead time so backend uses observed lead-time history rather than the promised. To keep service with low holding cost, forecast demand using the most recent stable low-demand regime (last 9 weeks) so orders are sized to current demand; volatility also estimated from same recent window. These parameters ensure the OR engine balances service (using recent demand and observed lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=298. Historical concluded lead-times (Periods 4\u201326 etc.) average \u22481.7; recent history supports actual lead time \u22482. Use calculate for L so backend computes average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Demand history samples (weekly 120,87,80,68,73) are limited but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std given the chosen L. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost and accommodates the large in-transit pipeline.

To remain conservative and let OR engine use full history and promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overfitting to sparse recent zero sales (stockouts) and leverages observed concluded lead-time ~2.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent concluded history shows demand has fallen substantially (last 5 concluded demands: 16,20,8,5,10) versus higher spring/summer spikes; in-transit = 298 units (large pipeline). Past concludes provide many observed lead times\u2014use backend's computed average rather than promised. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the latest low-demand regime (captures current low weekly demand and reduces over-ordering given large pipeline). This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5 and a large in-transit position.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=298. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) with recent long gaps but overall average lead_time \u22482; use backend-calculated average (calculate) to capture that. Demand has shifted down since mid-2019 (Periods 24\u201342 show persistently lower weekly demand vs earlier peaks). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering Periods 24\u201342) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility, which reduces overstating required stock given current low demand while allowing the OR engine to incorporate the calculated L. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1), avoiding excessive inventory buildup against the 298 units already in transit.

There are no new sustained delivery failures since Period 26; use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt to observed concludes. Demand history is limited in the seed samples; use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples given L. This balances service (using observed average lead time) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1) by letting the OR engine compute the safety stock from q=0.5.

Historical concludes show most observed lead_times \u22481\u20132 (carry-over: avg ~1.69) after earlier lost shipments; pipeline is large (298) so do not inflate lead time. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecast scales with (1+L) based on full sample history; this avoids overreacting to recent low sales and leverages long-run demand estimates while the OR engine caps order size. This balances service (use observed shorter lead time) vs holding cost given sizable in-transit.

Historical concluded lead times (Periods 4\u201326 and later concludes) average \u22481.7 but cluster around 1\u20132; no new sustained change in arrivals or demand regime. I set L to be calculated from observed conclude data to let the backend use the empirical average lead time. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use the defaults (all samples) so base_stock reflects long-run sample mean scaled by (1+L); this balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5). No explicit corrections for potential lost shipments now because recent concludes support ~2-period effective lead time.

Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=298. Historical concluded lead-times vary (many 1\u20133 periods); prior analysis averaged \u22481.69. No new sustained changepoint in concluded arrivals since P26, and in-transit stock is large relative to recent low weekly demand, so avoid increasing demand forecast or volatility. Choose L by calculating the average of all observed lead times to capture the historically mixed lead-time behavior; use default demand and volatility formulations so the OR engine scales forecasts by (1+L) using full-sample statistics. This keeps ordering conservative given the large in-transit pipeline and balances service level vs. holding cost.
