Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Using promised lead time (default) L=2. Demand history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) shows mean\u224831.8/week; I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock appropriate for current uncertainty while avoiding overfitting to very short series.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 ordered=62 arrived=0), so actual lead time not observed; use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples (13,21,55,47,23) give mean\u224831.8 and std\u224818.14. On-hand=0, in-transit=62; using default methods keeps the OR backend anchored to long-run demand (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean) and volatility while accounting for promised L, avoiding overreaction to one missing conclude.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=144. Two recent orders (P1:62, P2:82) have not yet concluded but promised lead time=2; arrivals for those orders will only be visible after their arrival in conclude messages, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments yet. Historical weekly demand mean=31.8 (samples provided). I will use the promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this is conservative given limited confirmed evidence and avoids premature adjustments while in-transit stock is outstanding.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) shows a clear upward regime: demands = [79,115,96], avg \u2248 96.7 vs historical Jan mean \u2248 31.8. Orders placed in P1\u2013P3 have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating shipments are delayed/lost versus promised L=2. To be conservative, set lead time explicit=3 to cover additional delay risk. Forecast demand over review+lead using the most recent 3 periods (recent_N N=3) to capture the new higher demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect observed variability in the new regime. These choices raise target base stock to meet the much higher demand while acknowledging longer transit risk and limiting understock cost given profit=$4 vs holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-3 demand avg increased to 96.7 (from historical ~31.8); Lead time appears longer than promised: orders placed in P1-P3 all arrived=0 (no concludes) suggesting delayed/lost shipments

=== Period 4 Summary ===
711053003: ordered=127, arrived=82 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=82, demand=117, sold=82, ending on-hand inventory=0

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand has shifted up: Periods 1-4 demands = [79,115,96,117], recent average ~101.75 over last 4 periods (much higher than historical ~31.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=250 \u2014 pipeline large but some earlier orders were delayed; Period 4 conclude shows an arrival for the P2 order with lead_time=2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (we now have confirmed observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime across the review+lead period. For sigma I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using recent mean/volatility and observed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 1-5 demand: 79,115,96,117,81) vs. historical mean ~31.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=332 (pipeline adequate short-term). One concluded arrival establishes actual observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine raises base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while avoiding excessive hold given holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has shifted up (periods 1\u20136 show consistently higher weekly demand vs. historical Jan samples). Observed concluded lead times: one 2-period and one 1-period arrival \u2192 mixed but use observed average. On-hand=0, in-transit=250 (covers upcoming demand). Set L to calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the six most recent demand observations (captures new high-demand regime and recent variance). This balances higher service need from uplifted demand while avoiding excessive holding costs by using recent data rather than all historical low-demand samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has permanently shifted up vs. historical (periods 1-7 mean \u224896.4 vs historical \u224831.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations show mixed 2 and 1 periods; use calculated average to reflect uncertainty. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (all available recent samples Periods 1-7) to capture the higher demand level and recent variability; this raises base stock to meet service while OR backend cap will limit extreme orders given pipeline. These choices balance profit-driven service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding costs and account for possible delayed arrivals by using observed lead-time average.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has shifted materially above historical Jan samples: Periods 1-8 demands = [79,115,96,117,81,92,95,190] indicating a sustained higher-demand regime (mean \u2248 111 over last 8). Observed concluded lead times: order on P2\u2192arrived P4 (LT=2), P5\u2192P6 (LT=1), P7\u2192P8 (LT=1) -> variable but average \u22481.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=250 (large pipeline). To reflect the confirmed higher demand regime, I use recent demand (last 8 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend scales base-stock to current demand; for lead time I ask backend to calculate the average observed lead time (uses concluded messages) so it captures the mixed LT evidence. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts in the new high-demand regime) while the OR engine's cap limits over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has clearly shifted up (multiple weeks ~80\u2013190, recent mean >100) and variability is elevated (190 spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=377 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1} so I use the average observed lead time to reflect actual behavior. To capture the new, higher demand regime I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 5\u20139) so the OR backend builds a base stock for the elevated mean and higher variance while the averaged lead time L corrects for recent lead-time behavior and avoids over-ordering against overdue/lost shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=46, in-transit=273; pipeline appears healthy but past periods showed both 1- and 2-period arrivals (recent concluded lead times: 2,1,1,1). Demand has been elevated vs. historical (recent demands: P6=92, P7=95, P8=190, P9=101, P10=81). To balance service vs. holding cost: set L based on recent observed lead times (average of last 4 concluded lead times) to capture mixed 1-2 period behavior. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent demand regime including the spike at P8. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand and observed lead-time variability while avoiding overstock from older low-demand history.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=354. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1 period recently (P6,P8,P10) with one 2-period observation (P4), so average lead time is close to 1 but using calculated average captures observed variation. Demand has clearly shifted up from earlier historical Jan samples; recent periods (P2\u2013P11) show a sustained higher regime (~\u2248100 weekly). To capture the current higher demand I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 demand samples to reflect the sustained elevated demand and recent volatility. These parameters provide the OR engine an updated (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility while L will be computed from observed lead times so the backend bases base_stock on empirical lead-time behaviour.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent weekly demand is much higher than the original 2019 sample set (recent periods avg ~96\u2013104 vs historical ~31.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=362 which provides substantial pipeline cover. Observed concluded lead times: 2,1,1,1 \u2192 average ~1.25; I use backend 'calculate' to let it compute the observed-average lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 12 demand observations so the OR engine targets stock for the recent high-demand level while the large in-transit position limits new ordering aggressiveness.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=9, in-transit=281 (healthy pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = {2,1,1,1,2}); use average to reflect this variability. Demand has clearly shifted up versus the Jan baseline; recent periods (P4\u2013P13) show a sustained higher regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (last 10 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I set sigma_hat to recent_N, N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service level (capture higher mean and recent variability) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Recent realized demand is well above historical Jan samples (sustained high-demand regime since Period 4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=336 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (from history) = {2,1,1,1,2,2} \u2192 average 1.5; I choose to let backend compute average observed lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period realizations. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 demand samples (regime length \u2248 Period 4\u201314 = 11 weeks) so the OR engine targets inventory for the new demand level and its volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and mixed lead times.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. Recent demand remains elevated (recent 5 demands ~74,104,72,81,96 -> avg ~85) vs historical ~31.8; on-hand=0, in-transit=346 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,1,2,2] (avg 1.5) with variability; use recent average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period realizations. Set L by recent_N (N=6) to capture current lead-time mix. Set mu_hat by recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast to the most recent high-demand regime ((1+L) factor applied by backend). Set sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the new higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has clearly shifted up vs. historical Jan samples (recent periods show many 80-243 weekly units). On-hand=0, in-transit=346 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded messages confirm lead_time\u22482; I'll use promised lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the last 5 demand observations to reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility). This balances service (higher forecast) versus holding cost by basing forecasts on recent data while relying on existing in-transit stock to cover near-term demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=451. Recent demand has shifted up: last 5 demands = [72,81,96,243,178] (mean\u2248134). Observed concluded lead times in recent arrivals: last 3 observed lead_times = [2,2,2] (orders from P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14, P15\u2192P17). To protect service with elevated demand and recent confirmed 2-period arrivals, I set L as recent_N over last 3 observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N over the last 5 demand samples to capture the new higher mean and variance; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4, holding=$1 (q=0.8) and large pipeline inventory already in flight.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 15: avg demand Periods 15-17 = (96+243+178)/3 = 172 (vs historical ~31.8); sustained high demand for 3+ periods.

Recent concluded lead times show a shift toward 2 periods (last 3 observed lead_times = 2,2,2) so I use recent_N for L to reflect current supplier behavior. Demand regime elevated since Period 15 (Periods 15-17 avg = 172); use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime. These choices raise the (1+L) demand forecast and variability so the OR backend will order more to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost with the capped order policy.

To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set demand estimates using recent_N over the last 5 periods (Periods 15-19). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, In-transit=662 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no visible on-hand stock. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:1, P10:1, P13:2, P14:2, P17:2, P19:1} \u2192 average = 1.5. Recent sustained demand regime started Period 15 (periods 15\u201320 show high demand: 96,243,178,132,273,201; regime length=6). To reflect confirmed actual lead-time evidence, set L using calculated average. For demand, use recent_N over the last 6 periods (covers the new high-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and volatility. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) while respecting observed faster-than-promised arrivals and large in-transit stock to avoid unnecessary extra ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has clearly entered a sustained higher regime beginning Period 15: Periods 15-21 demands = [96,243,178,132,273,201,160], mean \u2248183.3. Pipeline is large (in-transit=662) and on-hand=0; many past orders have mixed arrival delays (observed lead times vary 1\u20132). I set L using recent lead-time observations to capture the empirical 1\u20132 variability (use recent_N to be responsive). For demand I use recent_N over the detected high-demand regime (Periods 15-21, N=7) so mu_hat reflects the higher mean across the review+lead period. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts in the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat preserves safety-stock sizing given observed variability; using recent_N for L mitigates risk from the intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 15: Periods 15-21 avg demand = 183.3 (n=7) vs historical mean \u224831.8; sustained for 7 consecutive periods.

Historical concluded lead times (most recent): [2,2,2,1,2] (orders concluded in Periods 13,14,17,19,22) => use recent_N N=5 to estimate L\u22481.8 (captures recent variability but leans toward 2). Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 15 (Periods 15-22 show elevated demand); use recent_N for demand with N=8 (Periods 15-22) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the high-demand regime across the review+lead window. These choices raise the base stock to meet sustained elevated demand while letting the OR backend cap orders using its safety-cap logic; using recent samples for sigma preserves realistic variability for safety-stock sizing.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 15 (multiple periods with demand >> historical mean) and mixed but mostly 1-2 period actual lead times. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=614. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,2] \u2192 average \u22481.56. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates over the recent regime (Periods 15-23, n=9). For lead time, use calculated average of all observed lead times so the OR backend accounts for faster-than-promised arrivals on average. These choices keep base_stock aligned with the new higher demand while reflecting realized lead-time performance, helping balance service level (avoid stockouts given strong demand) versus holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 15 (avg \u2248183 over P15-21 and continued high through P24). On-hand=0, in-transit=651 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but past shipments show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average (reflecting mixed 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201324, n=10), so base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This balances service (cover sustained high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27).

On-hand=0, in-transit=618 (large pipeline). I set L using recent_N=5 to reflect the most recent empirical lead-time behavior (captures the recent 1-3 variability, avg=2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (last 5 demands: 109,268,216,168,121; mean\u2248176.4) and its volatility so the OR backend computes a base-stock sized for the higher demand while the cap limits over-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 15 (avg ~183 over P15-21) and variable realized lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,3,2], mean\u22481.73). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=622 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly high-demand (~160-270 recent). To reflect confirmed longer-than-historical demand regime I set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (recent_N) over the full post-changepoint window (Periods 15\u201327, N=13) so mu_hat matches current elevated demand. For lead time I let the backend compute the empirical average from observed concludes (method=calculate) to capture variable realizations around the promised 2. Volatility is estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=13) to size safety stock for the elevated regime. These choices keep service high (profit/holding ratio favors higher fill) while using observed pipeline (622) to avoid unnecessary fresh orders when many units are in transit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 15 (Periods 15-28 show consistently elevated weekly demand vs historical ~31.8) and observed lead times fluctuate around 2 with occasional 1\u20133 period realizations. On-hand=0, in-transit=622 (large pipeline). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime, I use recent demand (most recent regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend ramps target stock for elevated demand; for L I let backend calculate average observed lead time from concluded messages to reflect actual variability. These settings balance higher service level during sustained high demand while relying on the OR engine to cap orders using its cap rule given the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=622. Historical concluded lead times vary (recent observed: 2,3,2,1,2) \u2014 average of last 5 = 2.0, aligns with promised 2 but shows occasional 3. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 15; recent 7-period average (Periods 23-29) = ~176.7, so use recent-window demand estimates to capture current high regime and volatility. Set L by recent lead-time average (recent_N N=5) to reflect observed variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect sustained high demand and its variability; this will raise base-stock to protect service while capping orders via backend cap to limit holding cost exposure.

I set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate) to reflect the empirical average ~1.83 periods. For demand I use a recent_N regime estimate (N=16, Periods 15\u201330) to capture the sustained higher mean; same recent window for volatility to reflect elevated variability. These choices bias the base-stock up to protect service under the sustained high-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid under/over-ordering.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=626 \u2014 large pipeline present but recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 15 (Periods 15-31 consistently high vs historical). Concluded lead-time observations are variable (recent arrivals show 1\u20133 periods) so I use a recent average to capture current variability. Set L by averaging the last 6 observed lead times (captures the recent mix of 1\u20133 period leads, yielding \u22482). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 (the sustained high-demand regime from Period 15\u201331, n=17) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the high-demand regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat during sustained high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit; using recent regime statistics prevents understocking during elevated demand while L recent_N accounts for lead-time variability.

Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 15 (Periods 15-32 show consistently elevated weekly demand vs historical pre-change mean). To capture the new regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent 18 demand observations (regime length \u224818), so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:

Concluded arrivals show variable but centered around 2 periods lead time (multiple concluded messages with 1\u20133, average \u22482), so use calculated average lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201333, n=19) to capture the elevated mean and volatility; this keeps the OR base-stock tuned to the new demand level while the backend caps orders. No new long-lived lead-time or demand pattern beyond the already-recorded high-demand regime to add as a new carry-over insight.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 15 (Periods 15-34: consistently elevated weekly demand) and variable actual lead times (observed lead times = {2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,3,2,3,2}, avg \u22481.85). On-hand=0, in-transit=615 (large pipeline). To reflect the confirmed sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=20) so the backend forecasts demand across the review+lead period from current high-demand data. For lead time I choose calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures variability around the promised 2). These choices balance service (higher demand forecast) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 15 (carry-over notes). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) but cluster around 2; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer actual. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime data. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=615 \u2014 large pipeline exists so the higher forecast will be moderated by pipeline in the backend cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost by grounding forecasts in recent high-demand samples and letting the backend cap limit over-ordering.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 15 (periods 15-36 show consistently elevated weekly demand vs historical ~31.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=613 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (evidence below), so I set lead time explicit=3 to protect against repeated 3-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 20 demands). Volatility similarly set recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the high-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits ordering risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P33\u2192P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=758. Historical carry-over shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 15 (many consecutive high weeks) and lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P33\u2192P36). To cover review+lead demand under the sustained high regime and to reflect confirmed longer lead time (avoiding stockouts from delayed shipments), set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent 20 samples from the high-demand regime, which balances service level against holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). Recent history shows sustained high demand since Period 15 (confirmed multi-period regime) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 3 (Period 37 insight: P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P33\u2192P36). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=615 (large pipeline). To protect service while accounting for confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (uses most recent week-like window to reflect recent elevated means/volatility). Using recent demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat balances filling the longer pipeline (avoid stockouts) while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (OR backend will compute base_stock and cap using these inputs).

Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 15; to capture recent elevated demand I use a recent_N window to estimate demand across review+lead. Choosing L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=7 and sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to quantify mean and volatility from the most recent sustained high-demand samples (balances service level against holding cost while avoiding understock given long lead time and high demand).

Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 15 (multi-period high demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=615 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrival timing uncertain. Lead times have varied historically (observed 1\u20133); I'll let backend compute average observed lead time to reflect variability. For demand I use a recent-window to capture the sustained high-demand regime (long-run since P15) so the backend scales (1+L)*mean over recent samples. Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit > holding cost) while letting OR cap limit large single orders when pipeline already large.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 15 ( Periods 15-41 show much higher weekly demand vs historical). On-hand=0, in-transit=615 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time increased recently; lead-time pattern confirmed previously (periods with 3). To protect service during sustained high demand I set lead time to 3 (explicit). I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (N capped at 20 per rules). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the high-demand regime while using observed recent volatility; large in-transit reduces order quantity via backend cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=696 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 15 (confirmed through Period 22 and beyond). Observed lead times (from concluded messages) average \u22481.87 periods; I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use the most recent 20 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand). Sigma uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock (q=0.8) and cap constraints given the large pipeline.

Historical concludes show a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 15 (Periods 15-21 avg \u2248183) and lead-time evidence recently includes confirmed 3-period lead times (Period 37 evidence). To protect service during the sustained high-demand regime I use recent demand samples (N=7 capturing Periods15-21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For L I use a recent average of the last 3 observed lead-times to reflect the confirmed shift toward longer lead times while remaining responsive to recent variability. These choices bias the base-stock up to meet higher demand while accounting for longer pipeline delays so the OR backend increases order targets but still applies its capping.

Recent demand has been variable; no new 3+-period sustained regime change since prior insights. To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes review+lead demand correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, keeping conservative estimates rather than overfitting short recent noise. This balances service (longer confirmed lead time) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): recent demand (Periods 39-45) averaged ~81 units/week (7 samples: 85,162,59,126,53,35,47). On-hand=34; in-transit=615 \u2014 large pipeline covers multiple periods. Historical lead-time evidence (concludes) confirms a 3-period actual lead time (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations). To be conservative and align the OR engine with observed reality, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 7 weeks) rather than long-run historical mean; this focuses safety stock on current volatility while letting large pipeline prevent stockouts. This balances service (high pipeline + appropriate lead time) against holding cost by not inflating demand estimate with older low-demand data.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=615. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time has shifted to ~3 periods (multiple P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P33\u2192P36 observations). Demand regime: earlier sustained high regime (Periods 15-21) has since moderated; recent demand (Periods 42-46 = 126,53,35,47,120) is more variable and lower than the mid-year peak. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. For forecasting I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent demand regime (balances including the 126 and 120 spikes while smoothing short blips). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N captures current volatility. These choices align the OR backend toward higher coverage (q high given profit/holding) while reflecting confirmed longer lead time and recent demand pattern.
