  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From concluded history, actual lead times have varied (1\u20133 periods) but Periods 4/5/6/... show shipments arriving; no new concluded arrivals indicate lead time hasn't newly shifted. Inventory & demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=340. Recent demand (P41\u2013P46) averages \u224881/week; three-period demand \u2248243. Pipeline of 340 units exceeds (L+1)-period demand even under L=2 and recent elevated demand. OR recommended 0; given large in-transit volume and no sustained new signals of lost shipments or demand regime change in the last 3 periods, I follow OR and place no order to avoid holding cost. Final strategy: order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while monitoring for any future conclude messages that reveal lost shipments or lead-time shifts; if multiple expected arrivals fail to conclude in coming periods, escalate ordering to rebuild cover.",
