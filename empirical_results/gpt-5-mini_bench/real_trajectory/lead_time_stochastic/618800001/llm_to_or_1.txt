Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show stable weekly sales ~146 avg; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. Use promised lead time (default) since no observed lead-time deviations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects historical demand while the system gathers arrival/lead-time signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~146 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (order placed Period 1); that arrival is not yet concluded so actual lead time is unconfirmed. No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change. To remain consistent with promised lead time and the available demand history, set L to default (promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost while avoiding overreaction to unconfirmed delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand history (5 samples) mean ~146 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (orders placed in P1/P2 not yet concluded). Period 1 and 2 conclude show arrivals=0 but those orders may still be in-transit given promised L=2; insufficient concluded evidence to declare a lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time to avoid overreacting. Set L=default so backend uses promised L=2. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level versus holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent weekly demand samples (148,133,150,139,160) show mean ~146. On-hand=0, in-transit=478 (these in-transit units may include overdue/lost shipments: Period3 conclude shows arrived=0, so orders placed in Period1 did not arrive by Period3). Because multiple consecutive conclude messages report no arrivals when arrivals were expected, I treat lead time as longer than promised and set L explicit=3 to hedge against delayed/lost shipments. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and \u221a(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this increases recommended base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Period1 did not arrive by Period3 conclude (arrived=0); evidence of lead-time >2 or lost shipments across multiple periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): Recent concluded history shows the P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=496 (includes multiple outstanding orders; P1 order remains unconfirmed/overdue). Demand history (5 weekly samples) has mean 146 units. Given confirmed lead time=2 and no clear demand regime shift, I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using observed lead time) and holding cost (defaults avoid overreacting to potentially lost/late single shipments).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand history shows stable weekly demand around 140\u2013190 (samples mean=146). On-hand=0, in-transit=526 (large pipeline). Period 4 conclude confirmed an observed lead time of 2 (Period2\u2192Period4), matching the promised lead time; some earlier orders appear delayed/lost but a large pipeline exists now. Given matching observed lead time and no sustained demand regime shift, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its historical mean/variance over the review+lead horizon. This keeps parameters consistent with observed lead time=2, leverages the large in-transit quantity to avoid over-ordering, and balances high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has been rising (last observed demands: 144,165,184,188,170,204) with frequent stockouts and mixed lead-time evidence: one concluded arrival showed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) and another showed lead_time=1 (P5\u2192P6). In-transit = 498. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to capture variability (backend will compute avg from concluded arrivals). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples\u2014this balances higher service level for the observed elevated demand while avoiding overfilling given possible lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand (Periods 4-7 = 188,170,204,257) is markedly higher than historical Jan samples (mean 146). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 (large pipeline) but prior late/no-arrivals indicate some shipments delayed/lost; therefore use a short-term inferred lead time and recent-demand estimates. Set L by averaging the two most recent observed lead times (observed W=2 in P4, W=1 in P6) to capture current realized lead-time behavior. Set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 4 demand periods (Periods 4-7) to reflect the new, higher demand regime for the review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 4 periods to reflect recent volatility. These parameters aim to raise the target base stock to meet higher demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering; using recent windows avoids diluting the new regime with older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand increased from 146.0 (Periods 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) to 204.75 (Periods 4-7, 2019-03-04 to 2019-03-25) (+40.2%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent history shows a demand regime shift upward starting Period 4 (avg ~204.75) and mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=667 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating orders but reflect higher realized demand. Set L="calculate" to use the average of observed lead times (1 and 2 values) so backend accounts for empirical lead time ~1.5. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to base the (1+L)*mean demand on the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 4-7). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the new higher demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior to moderate ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and past delayed arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Demand has shown a sustained upward regime since Period 4 (carry-over insight). On-hand is 0 with 1050 in-transit; several past orders experienced mixed lead times (some arrived late or not at all), so I use recent observed lead times rather than the promised value. Set L via recent_N to average the last 4 observed lead times (captures the alternating 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 4\u20139) to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward a higher base stock to meet elevated demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given past delays.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times of {2,1,2,1,2,1} (avg=1.5) and demand increased starting Period 4 (regime avg ~204.8). Current on-hand=321, in-transit=496 (pipeline ample vs elevated demand). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 4\u201310) to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed higher-demand regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility (spike in Period 8). These choices balance service (higher base stock for elevated demand and variable lead times) against holding costs given strong pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been elevated vs earlier baseline (Periods 4-11 show higher mean). On-hand=15 + in-transit=602 looks ample but past shipments showed mixed lead times (observed 1 or 2 periods). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 7\u201311) to capture the sustained higher regime (recent demands: 257,394,206,233,306; mean\u2248279) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via backend service-level cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1003 \u2014 large pipeline but past periods show mixed 1\u20132 period actual lead times and some earlier lost shipments. Demand regime shift at Period 4 raised mean materially; recent realized demands (Periods 4\u201312) = [188,170,204,257,394,206,233,306,225] (regime length=9). I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures the frequent 1\u20132 mix). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to base (1+L)*mean on the confirmed higher-demand regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets the current higher demand and observed lead-time behavior while accounting for recent variability and avoiding reliance on stale low-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=46, in-transit=897. History shows mixed 1\u20132 period actual lead times (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,1,2) and earlier missing arrivals; promised L=2 but variability exists. Demand regime increased around Period 4 historically; recent realized weekly demand samples (Periods 9\u201313) are: 206,233,306,225,60 (volatile). Given observed lead-time variability, use calculated average lead time from concluded arrivals to let the backend infer typical L. For demand forecast use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated but volatile regime while retaining responsiveness to the drop in Period 13. For volatility use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand dispersion. This balances service (avoid stockouts with large in-transit) against holding cost\u2014we rely on backend capped policy but provide recent mean/variance to moderate excess ordering given large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift around Period 4 (higher mean) but the last 5 weeks (Periods 10-14) show mixed demand (233,306,225,60,69). On-hand=378 and in-transit=496 provide a large pipeline cushion; some earlier shipments were delayed/lost but concluded lead-times observed are a mix of 1 and 2 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 period reality). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to make the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent five demand observations (captures the recent downturn after a high-demand spell) so the OR engine reduces excess holding while maintaining service. This balances profit vs. holding cost given current high inventory and uncertain arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=330, in-transit=496. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (avg \u22481.6); shipments have previously been delayed/lost early but recent confirms mostly 2 with some 1s. Recent demand has moderated after a spike; last 5 realized demands (Periods 11-15) = [306,225,60,69,48] showing a lower current regime. To capture the observed variability in lead-time I let the backend compute the empirical average (calculate). For demand I use the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current, lower-demand regime (recent_N, N=5). I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma to capture current demand volatility. These choices reduce overstating mean demand (avoiding excess holding) while allowing the OR engine to size safety stock given mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has declined sharply vs the earlier spring spike: last 4 concluded demands = [60,69,48,48] (Periods 13-16), so I base demand forecast on this recent low-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (multiple confirms of 2 and some 1); I let backend compute the average observed lead time. Choose L=calculate to capture observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to target the most recent low-demand regime and reduce overstocking given substantial on-hand (282) and in-transit (496) inventory. This balances service vs holding cost by shrinking forecasted demand and volatility to current lower levels while letting L reflect empirical lead-time behavior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=249, in-transit=496. Recent concluded lead-time observations are mixed (1 and 2 periods) with no sustained shift beyond previously recorded anomalies, so set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to let backend infer the empirical mean lead time (~1.625). Demand showed a temporary spike around Periods 4\u201311 but has reverted to lower levels in Periods 13\u201317, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples) rather than recent-window adjustments. These choices balance service (capture observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given high on-hand and substantial pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=218, in-transit=500. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed samples: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2 -> avg 1.625). Demand regime shifted up earlier (Periods 4-7) but recent realized weekly demand since Period 10 has been lower and more stable (Periods 10-18 demands: 233,306,225,60,69,48,48,33,31). To balance service level vs holding cost given large current pipeline and observed lead-time variability, I set L to the calculated average lead time to let the backend account for realized variability; use a recent_N demand estimate (last 9 periods) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent demand regime; use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility. This avoids over-ordering based on older higher-demand weeks while acknowledging occasional longer lead times and existing in-transit stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has settled well below the March spike: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 15-19) = [48,48,33,31,36], mean=39.2. On-hand=186 + in-transit=496 => pipeline=682, which comfortably covers a multi-period buffer. Lead-time history (observed in conclude messages) shows mixed 1\u20132 period outcomes; average of observed lead times is ~1.56, so use the backend's lead-time estimator (calculate) to reflect observed variation. For demand I target the recent, lower regime using recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects current mean demand over the review+lead horizon; use the same recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk from the March spike while keeping service for current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=114, in-transit=496. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 1\u20132 period observations (avg ~1.56). Demand regime shifted up at Period 4 and recent demand has been lower than the early spike but still above the very first baseline; to capture the post-changepoint regime I use a recent-window for demand. Set L=calculate so backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded messages (~1.56). Set mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 9 demand samples (captures the higher regime while limiting noise). Keep sigma_hat=default to use overall observed volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (accounting for observed lead-time >1 and higher recent demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand for mean and conservative default volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Recent demand has moderated since the March spike; last 7 demands (Periods15-21) = [48,48,33,31,36,72,72], avg \u224848.6. On-hand=42, in-transit=496 (ample pipeline).

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to focus the forecast on the current lower-demand regime; this yields (1+L)\xd7mean_of_last7 implicitly. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep orders aligned with the current lower-demand regime while L via calculation guards against intermittent 1\u20132 period lead-time realizations and helps avoid overstock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=2, in-transit=496. Historical concludes show mixed actual lead times (mostly 1\u20132 periods) and earlier evidence of lost shipments, so use inferred average lead time. Demand shifted up around Period 4 but the last ~10 periods (P13\u2013P22) show a lower, more stable demand regime; choose recent demand estimates to reflect current lower demand and reduce excess holding. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to use observed average lead time (~1.56); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=10 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 demand observations (captures the recent subdued demand); sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility. These settings keep target base stock aligned with current lower demand while the OR backend will cap order size using its cap to avoid overshooting the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/07/22. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1], avg \u22481.56) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history includes earlier regime shift (not new here) and recent weekly demand has stabilized at lower levels; use default demand/volatility scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base stock and cap with the inferred lead time and historical samples. Current pipeline (496) plus on-hand (0) likely covers several weeks, so conservative defaults avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has settled well below the March spike: Periods 15-24 demand series = [48,48,33,31,36,72,72,40,31,64], recent mean=47.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=686 (large pipeline from prior orders); promised lead time=2 but observed lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2). To balance service vs holding cost: infer L by averaging observed lead times (captures mix of 1\u20132 without overcommitting); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent stable regime (last 10 periods) to avoid inflating forecasts from the March spike. This keeps base-stock close to current demand while accounting for the 1+L review+lead exposure and recent volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=686 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.56); use calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time. Recent demand has fallen from spring spike; use recent_N for mu_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=10 covers the latest 10 demand periods). Keep sigma_hat default so backend scales volatility by (1+L). This reduces excess ordering risk given the large in-transit position while letting OR backend target service level using observed lead-time and recent demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent weekly demand has trended down from the spring peak (Mar-Apr) to low summer levels (last observed demands: 64,43,30). On-hand=0, in-transit=686 \u2014 large pipeline exists so we must avoid over-ordering. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average of observed lead times \u22481.57 so use a calculated L to capture this variability. Use default demand and volatility estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service level (protect vs. 1\u20132 period LT) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent observed demand has fallen from the spring spike; last 8 periods (P20-P27) average demand ~48.8/week. On-hand=0, large in-transit=686 (risk of overstocking if demand low). Some earlier evidence of delayed/lost shipments exists but recent concluded arrivals show mostly 1-2 period lead times. To avoid overreacting to isolated lost shipments while accounting for the current low-demand regime and large pipeline, keep promised lead time, set demand forecast using the most recent 8 weeks, and use default volatility (uses all samples) so the OR backend's capped ordering will naturally limit orders given the large pipeline.

Date 2019-08-26. Recent demand (Periods 24-28) has been low: [64,43,30,48,69], avg \u224850.8 units/week. On-hand=0 but large pipeline=686 units (likely enough for many weeks). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods (mixed); average lead time \u22481.6. To avoid ordering into an already-large pipeline, I set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N=5) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, yielding lower recommended orders consistent with current low demand and high in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent on-hand=0, large in-transit=686. Historical concluded lead-times are mostly 1 or 2 periods (mixed arrivals and some early lost shipments), so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes. Demand exhibited a sustained downward regime since the spring spike; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 24-29 = 64,43,30,48,69,63) show a lower recent mean (~52.8) and moderate volatility. To avoid overstocking given the large pipeline, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and variability reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce ordering aggressiveness. These choices balance service level (by using observed lead time) against holding cost (by basing demand on the recent lower regime).

Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods) and past evidence of delayed/lost shipments; demand since Period 24\u201330 has been consistently low (seven-week window: 64,43,30,48,69,63,72 \u2192 mean \u224855.6). To balance service vs holding cost I (1) infer lead time from observed concluded lead times (average) and (2) set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 7 weeks to reflect the sustained lower summer demand while avoiding excess stocking given high in-transit inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=686. Historical concluded arrivals show a mix of 1\u20132 period lead times (several P\u2192P+1 and P\u2192P+2 observations) and earlier lost arrivals; promised LT=2 but actuals vary. Demand: early 2019 spike (Period4+), then from Period14 onward demand settled at a lower steady level (~30\u201375/week). I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times to let the backend infer the empirical average (captures the 1\u20132 period variation). For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the current lower-demand regime (use recent data to avoid bias from the early spike). I choose N=10 to cover the most recent ~10 weeks of demand, balancing sensitivity and sample size. sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the current low-demand regime while letting L reflect observed variability, reducing excess holding on long-tail in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=686 \u2014 large pipeline covers many weeks so risk of stockout is low despite current zero on-hand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods (mixed); no sustained shift beyond that. Recent demand has been lower (weeks June\u2013Sept mostly 29\u201372) compared with the March spike already recorded in carry-over. I select L="calculate" to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures the 1\u20132 period reality), and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (pipeline already large) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=686 (large pipeline). To balance service vs. holding cost I let the system infer a data-driven lead time (average of observed lead times) and use default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes base stock and caps using full-history mean/variance while accounting for the inferred L. This avoids overreacting to recent sparse sales and uses the large in-transit pipeline implicitly when computing orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=686 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists from prior orders. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods (mixed), with some earlier missing arrivals; to capture actual observed variability I use the empirical average of observed lead times. Demand has been low and stable since Period 15 (many weeks of single- to double-digit weekly demand) so I downweight the early high-demand regime and use a recent-window estimate (captures current low-demand regime). Using recent_N for mu and sigma (N=20) adapts the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility to the current regime while L calculated from observations lets the OR backend set base stock consistent with realized lead time variability. This balances service (using observed L) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=686. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (observed = [2,1,2,1,2,2,1], avg \u22481.43) and earlier evidence of missing/delayed shipments, but recent periods show low demand. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average (captures realized variability vs promised=2). For demand and volatility I select default (backend will use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because there is no new sustained demand regime change since prior insights and recent low-demand weeks argue against upweighting earlier spikes. This balances service level (use observed lead time) while avoiding overstock from transient spikes given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has been low (last 10 weeks mostly 10\u201370 units) after an earlier sustained demand regime increase in Periods 4\u20137. On-hand=0, in-transit=686 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (avg \u22481.56); earlier missing arrivals were observed but later concluded shipments confirm variability rather than a persistent >2 lead time. To reflect observed lead-time variability, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times. Given the large in-transit position and stable lower recent demand, use default demand estimates (backend (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility; this keeps the OR engine conservative (won't over-order beyond pipeline) while the calculated L captures the shorter-than-promised effective lead-time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=686. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times mostly 1\u20132 periods (mix of 1 and 2), with some early lost shipments but recent behavior stable. Demand spiked in Mar (carry-over insight) but has fallen through summer/fall; recent weeks (Periods 31\u201338) show lower weekly demand (range ~13\u201372, recent values 19,13,21,44). I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 mixture). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime (captures recent lower seasonal demand). For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent variability and avoid inflating safety stock from old spike months. These settings balance service (use recent data and observed lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2), and earlier periods indicated possible lost/delayed shipments but current pipeline is substantial. To avoid over-ordering given high in-transit and low recent demand, set L to backend-calculated average of observed lead times, and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current low-demand regime; use the same recent window for volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime established earlier and variable actual lead times (observed 9 concluded arrivals with lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1], avg ~1.56). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=686 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with 1\u20132 period delays and some early periods showed lost shipments. To let the OR engine infer using observed lead-time behavior while leveraging full-sample demand stats, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (capturing actual lead-time avg >1) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:

Recent weeks (Periods 36-41) show elevated demand entering late Nov (13,21,44,41,58,73) \u2014 likely seasonal/Black Friday uplift. To capture this short recent regime, I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (reflecting (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 6 samples). With L=default and recent_N estimates, the OR backend will size base-stock to cover the current elevated demand while recognizing available in-transit units; this avoids unnecessary new orders given 686 units already in pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Demand shows a dramatic recent spike (Period 42 demand=542) indicating a shifted near-term regime; to capture this recent behavior I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine weights the past 5 weeks (including the spike) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility. On-hand=0 and in-transit=686 provides substantial pipeline cover; using recent_N helps the backend balance higher service level needed for the spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility to avoid severe stockouts or excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Demand shows a recent spike (Periods 42\u201343) but not yet a 3+ period sustained regime; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent elevated demand/volatility (captures the holiday spike while satisfying the minimum N).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent demand shows a large uptick (Periods 42-44 include a 542 spike and subsequent elevated weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=1225 (large pipeline). Observed lead times historically vary (1\u20132 periods) and some early shipments were delayed/lost; therefore use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast should focus on the recent elevated regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat based on the last 5 demand samples (Periods 40-44) to capture current holiday spike and elevated post-spike demand. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting current high demand while backend caps orders; large in-transit will reduce new order size.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent weeks show a clear holiday spike in demand (large volumes in Periods 42-45) while observed historical lead times fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=849 -> substantial pipeline but arrival timing uncertain. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 42-45) to capture the confirmed December/holiday demand regime rather than the long-run baseline. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect elevated volatility during this holiday spike. These choices prioritize meeting high seasonal demand (reducing stockouts) while backend cap will limit excessive ordering to control holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 42-45 average demand = 438 units vs baseline ~146 (Periods 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04); sustained high December/holiday demand across 3+ periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Product is in peak holiday season: recent weeks (Periods 42-46) show elevated demand (Dec spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=1515 \u2014 substantial pipeline but recent conclude (P46) showed ordered=666 arrived=0 indicating some arrivals still pending or delayed. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded lead-time observations have been a mix of 1\u20132 periods and there is no sustained confirmed change beyond what backlog explains. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current holiday/high regime (use last 5 periods of demand to set (1+L)*mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased variability during the holiday spike. These choices bias orders toward satisfying high seasonal demand while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent samples reduces risk of understocking during the confirmed seasonal peak while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).
