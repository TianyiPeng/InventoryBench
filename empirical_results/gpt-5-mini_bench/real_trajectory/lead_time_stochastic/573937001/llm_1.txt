SKU is women's skinny trousers \u2014 no strong immediate seasonality beyond normal winter->spring transition; small possible Valentine effect already passed (Feb 14 upcoming but minor for trousers).

Promised lead time=2 periods so an order placed now will arrive in Period 3; therefore we cannot satisfy Period 1 or Period 2 demand.
