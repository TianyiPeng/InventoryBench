Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 573937001 historical weekly samples (5): 64,46,43,52,63. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Promised lead time=2. No recent changepoint or seasonality signals (early Feb, stable samples). Use defaults so backend computes L=promised and mu_hat/sigma_hat from full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances service vs holding cost given symmetric profit and holding ($1/$1) and limited evidence to deviate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=70 (ordered P1) and P1 conclude showed arrived=0 which is consistent with promised lead time=2 (order placed P1 should arrive in P3). No concluded arrivals observed yet \u2192 cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Historical weekly demands: [64,46,43,52,63], mean=53.6. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5), use default lead time and demand estimates so backend computes a median-based base stock. Selected methods: L=default (use promised L=2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand, sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend size safety stock from historical variability. This is conservative given in-transit units and no confirmed lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=138 (orders from P1+P2). Historical weekly demand mean=53.6 (samples: 64,46,43,52,63). No concluded arrivals yet beyond Periods 1\u20132 (arrived=0) so no confirmed lead-time change; missing concludes may reflect normal lead-time. Using promised/default lead time to avoid premature adjustments. With L=default, the backend will compute (1+L)*mean demand and std over all samples; current pipeline (138) is slightly below the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast (~160.8), so policy will increase ordering to cover upcoming (L+1) periods while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=160 (matches orders 70+68+22). Promised L=2 but orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded by Period 3 conclude, indicating shipments are overdue. To be conservative, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to reflect delayed/lost shipment risk. Demand history: historical weekly samples mean=53.6; recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20133) = [45,60,66], recent average=57. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to weight the most recent observed demand regime over the longer-run sample given potential uptick. sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale variability by (1+L). These choices bias the OR engine toward higher pipeline targets to cover additional periods of demand given delayed arrivals while keeping volatility treatment standard.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (70,68,22 = 160 units) remain undelivered by Period 3 conclude \u2014 shipments overdue vs promised L=2; suggests actual lead time >=3 or lost shipments (sustained for 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show weekly mean ~53.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (orders from P1\u2013P3:70,68,22) but P4 conclude shows only the P2 order (68) arrived with lead_time=2; P1 and P3 shipments remain missing\u2014treat as lost/overdue. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (to capture confirmed L=2), and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which yields replenishment sized to cover review+lead demand while the OR engine's cap limits extreme ordering and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); Orders from Period 1 (70 units) and Period 3 (22 units) appear lost/overdue (no arrival by Period 4 conclude).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): demand context shows recent weekly demand ~50-70 (historical mean ~53.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (some past orders delayed/lost but lead time recently confirmed as 2). Use default lead time (promised L=2) because concluded history supports L=2 and lost shipments are sporadic; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand over the last 6 decision periods: [45,60,66,74,63,45] \u2014 elevated vs older Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=162 (contains prior arrivals; some earlier orders appear lost/overdue: Periods 1 and 3 orders never concluded). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) \u2014 variable. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability 1 and 2). For demand forecast, use recent_N N=6 to capture the current higher regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). For volatility, use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize matching the current elevated demand while letting the backend account for lead-time uncertainty via the calculated average.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=177, recent demand volatile with last 3 concluded demands = [63,45,83]; some shipments overdue historically but concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed lead_times = 2, 1). I choose L by averaging the two observed concluded lead times to capture current variability (recent_N, N=2 => avg 1.5). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent demand regime to react to the latest higher/variable demand (recent_N, N=3 uses last 3 demands). These choices raise forecasted required pipeline for near-term service while keeping volatility-based safety stock to limit excess holding given Profit=Holding= $1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,1,2} (mixed but centered ~1.6). Demand has increased versus the long-run sample: recent periods (P4\u2013P8) show higher mean (\u224872 units) than the 5-sample 2019-Jan baseline (\u224853.6). Several earlier orders were overdue/lost but recent arrivals confirm variable lead time. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding, q=0.5 -> z\u22480), I pick L inferred from observed lead times (calculate) and use recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the upward demand regime. Use recent volatility over same window to reflect increased demand variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand elevated vs Jan baseline (recent demands: 45,60,66,74,63,45,83,96,40) with recent spikes (83,96). On-hand=0, in-transit=217 \u2014 pipeline large but history shows some orders delayed/lost; observed lead times = {2,1,2,1} so use average to reflect variability. Set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent higher-demand regime (captures last 5 demand samples and limits influence of older Jan data). This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 for recent spikes) against holding cost by not overreacting to single high weeks.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. On-hand=14, in-transit=160 but prior evidence shows some early orders (P1,P3) may be lost/overdue; observed concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.5). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 variability). Demand has risen recently (last 5 realized weekly demands higher than earlier mean), so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to bias forecast toward the recent regime. Sigma set to default to let backend compute variability from full sample set scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance higher short-term demand coverage with measured volatility while accounting for lead-time variability and possible lost shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 demands (Periods 7-11) = [83,96,40,43,44], mean ~61.2 and higher variance than earlier samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (some earlier orders were lost/overdue earlier but recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times oscillating 1\u20132 periods). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures observed 1\u20132 period pattern). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to adapt mu_hat to the recent higher-demand regime (focus on last 5 periods). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the observed uptick while keeping variability estimates recent so the capped order prevents excessive inventory and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=184. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W = 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5) and several overdue/lost shipments earlier but no new sustained regime change. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand across (1+L) periods and volatility use full sample history (conservative given mixed lead times and no confirmed demand shift). This balances service (accounts for longer average lead time) versus holding cost by using full-sample demand estimates rather than up-weighting recent noisy spikes.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observations: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.57) and several earlier orders appear lost/overdue; demand recent weeks stabilised around mid-40s with intermittent spikes. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 mix). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to focus the forecast on the latest regime (captures recent mean ~55 across the last 7 weeks), reducing bias from older samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching pipeline coverage to the observed shorter/variable lead times while using a recent demand estimate to limit excess holding given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5), thus balancing service level and inventory cost given the large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (some prior orders were overdue/lost earlier but recent concludes consistently show lead_time\u22482). Use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise; demand history (historical samples mean \u224853.6/wk) supports default (1+L) scaling. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance while L=default preserves promised lead time assumption despite past missing shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=170 (pipeline large). Recent concludes show actual lead time \u2248 promised 2 periods for delivered orders; earlier missing shipments appear isolated/lost. Demand has trended up recently with high volatility (periods 11-15 demands: 44,39,43,67,109). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding, q=0.5 \u2192 z\u22480), keep L at promised (default) so OR uses L=2, use EWMA to emphasize recent upswing for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture current volatility (N=5). This increases forecasted mean to cover near-term surge while sigma from recent 5 periods captures current variability without overreacting to a single spike. No changes to lead-time estimate despite past lost orders since recent arrivals confirm L=2.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded history shows observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods (mixed but mostly 2) and multiple delayed/lost arrivals earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=283. To let the OR backend infer a robust lead-time estimate from observed concludes, I set L to calculate (average observed lead time). Demand forecasting uses default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to leverage full history; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and large pipeline that the OR engine will account for when capping orders.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent concludes show mixed lead times (1 or 2 periods); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times (avg ~1.6). On-hand=74 and in-transit=160 provide coverage vs expected demand; several earlier orders appear lost/overdue but recent arrivals confirm typical lead_time is near promised. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred L.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been volatile with several large weeks (notably P15=109) but the 5 historical samples (Jan 2019) show weekly demands ~46\u201364; current on-hand=39, in-transit=160. History of conclude messages shows observed lead times of {2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1} (avg=1.6) and some early lost/overdue shipments (Period 1 & 3 orders never concluded). To be conservative about actual lead-time variability, set L by calculating the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this balances service level (captures elevated demand weeks via L-informed multiplier) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand is variable with several large spikes (e.g. P15 demand=109) but no sustained new regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=160 (several past orders remain undelivered/overdue). Observed concluded lead-times (from conclude messages) average \u22481.6 periods; I select calculated L to let backend infer avg actual lead time from observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 conservative given mixed/volatile demand and overdue pipeline. This balances service level (using inferred average lead time) against holding cost while avoiding overfitting short bursts or late arrivals that may be lost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Demand context: historical weekly demand samples show moderate demand with no recent sustained regime shift; profit=holding cost so q=0.5. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=176 (covers several future periods). Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in observed arrivals; several earlier missing shipments were previously noted but recent history shows arrivals consistent with L=2. No strong evidence of a new demand mean/variance change. Therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service vs. holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=176. Historical conclude messages show most observed arrivals consistent with promised L=2 (recent confirms 2), so use default lead time to align with OR backend. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 49,35,55,17,33) reflects the current regime; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility over the review+lead window. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while the backend's base-stock/ cap formulas balance service level vs holding cost (profit=holding => q=0.5).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (includes long-overdue shipments from early periods). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time \u22482 when shipments arrive; some early orders appear lost but arrivals since Period 4/5 support L=2 as the operating cadence. Recent demand has been lower than earlier spikes: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18-22) = [35,55,17,33,52], mean \u224838.4. To balance service (profit=holding, q=0.5) while avoiding excess holding on a large in-transit pool, I use promised/default lead time and forecast demand from the recent 5 weeks to reflect the current regime and lower recent variability. Sigma is also estimated from the same recent window so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older high-demand spikes. No new sustained lead-time or regime changes to record.

Use promised/default lead time to match most recent confirmed behavior. Demand has been variable recently; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (last 5 demand periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent data rather than long-ago January samples.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (some past shipments have been delayed/lost historically but concluded arrivals show frequent 1\u20132 period lead times). Observed concluded lead times vary; average recent behavior around 1.6 periods so I'll let backend compute average from observed lead times (method=calculate). Demand has shifted down from early high peaks; recent 8 periods (P17\u2013P24) show a consistent lower regime (demands = 49,35,55,17,33,52,39,22, mean\u224837.8). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to use recent_N with N=8 so the backend targets (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime. This balances service (capture recent demand level) versus holding cost and accounts for mixed/uncertain lead-time evidence by letting backend infer average L.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 with several historically overdue/lost shipments; recent weekly demand (Periods 21-25) averaged ~33 units. Promised L=2 has produced lost/late orders historically; to be conservative I set lead time = 3 to cover delayed arrivals. Using recent demand mean (33) with review+lead factor (1+L=4) gives mu_hat=132. I set sigma_hat to 24 (\u2248 sqrt(1+L)*recent std \u2248 24) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders upward to cover potential delayed arrivals while keeping safety stock bounded given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent observed demand has been below earlier peaks (last 5 concluded demands: P22-26 = 52,39,22,19,44 \u2192 avg \u224835). Historical lead-time observations are consistent with 2 periods (several concluded arrivals show W=2). Large in-transit (160) contains overdue/lost earlier orders but recent concluded arrivals confirm L=2 so use promised/default lead time. To reduce stockouts given lower recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods (captures current lower-demand regime). Methods: L=default (promised 2); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (use recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (several older orders remain undelivered or pending confirmation). Historical concluded lead times (from arrive messages) show a mix of 1s and 2s with a mean \u22481.64; recent behavior still centers on 2 but with occasional 1. Demand samples (historic weekly sales) are stable without a clear recent regime shift. To balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each) I select L based on observed average lead time (capture real-world variability). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting it produce a base-stock that reflects all available demand history while the averaged L reflects actual lead-time experience and mitigates lost/overdue shipment risk.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (large pipeline from earlier orders). Recent demand (Periods 23-28) = [39,22,19,44,62,61] \u2014 avg \u224841.2, showing a moderate recent uptick vs earlier low-zero periods. Promised lead time has been confirmed previously as 2 in concluded history; no new sustained lead-time shift. To balance service vs holding cost I use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent regime (last 6 weeks) to react to the elevated recent mean while keeping variability estimated from the same window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

History shows some earlier overdue/lost shipments (Periods 1&3 orders never concluded) but subsequent conclude messages repeatedly show lead_time = 2 (common) with occasional 1; overall promised L=2 is supported. Demand history (training samples) is limited; to avoid overfitting to short recent noise I use the promised/default estimation so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (captures typical 2-period pipeline demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent concluded arrivals mostly show lead_time=2 (with occasional 1), so keep estimate linked to observed history. Use averaged observed lead time to let backend adapt to actual patterns; use default demand and volatility aggregation so OR backend uses all samples (scaled by 1+L). This balances service (capture multi-period demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and uncertain in-transit reliability.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (contains long-overdue shipments; backend unaware of losses). Use promised lead time so OR backend assumes L=2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus forecast/volatility on the latest demand regime (reduces influence of older spikes). This balances service (cover ~3 weeks demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so target service quantile is moderate.

Use L default to keep promised lead time (2) because concluded messages show frequent 2-period arrivals.

Observed concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2 periods) so I'll let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method: calculate). Demand shows no clear recent regime shift and historical data is the best anchor, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (using observed average lead time) against holding cost without overstating recent noise from overdue/in-transit units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history: on-hand=0, in-transit=160 units from long-outstanding orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 that have not concluded; however lead time was confirmed as 2 periods for other orders (Period 2 arrival in Period 4). Demand history shows regular weekly demand (many weeks with 30\u201380 units). I choose L.method='calculate' to let the backend average observed concluded lead times (captures evidence of mostly 2-period arrivals while allowing adaptation if more concluded lead times exist). For demand I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively \u2014 conservative given no strong, newly confirmed demand regime change. This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on observed lead-time statistics while avoiding overreacting to the outstanding in-transit volume (which may include lost shipments).

I choose L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Demand has no clear recent regime shift versus historical samples, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for inferred lead time.

Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Demand history (Periods 1\u201336) shows weekly demand mean \u224852 units; recent weeks continue similar variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 units (several earlier orders were overdue but lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods from past concluded messages). I use the promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with supplier promise and use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the engine computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) given substantial in-transit volume while avoiding explicit changes based on possibly lost/late historical shipments.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (several earlier shipments overdue/lost vs promised L=2). Concluded history shows most observed lead times = 2 (with occasional 1); I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand appears to have a slightly higher recent mean (last 5 weeks avg \u224854.4), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent regime and variability. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent demand level while letting the backend account for pipeline via its capped policy and the inferred lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=164. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22482 for delivered orders but several earlier orders remain lost/overdue; risk of missing shipments persists. I will use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend assumes L=2, and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This delegates detection of demand level to the full history while keeping parameters conservative given lost-shipment uncertainty; with profit=holding, the backend's q=0.5 balances service vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=164. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods repeatedly (Period 4 and Period 5 evidence), so no persistent lead-time increase to countermand promised L=2. In-transit=164 likely covers several upcoming weeks of demand; use default lead time to align with promised L. Demand history is volatile but no recent sustained regime shift detected (no 3+ period change with consistent higher/lower mean), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on backend's base-stock calculation while not overreacting to intermittent delayed/lost shipments observed earlier.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=164. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 in multiple past periods though some earlier orders appear lost; no new sustained lead-time regime change detected. Given profit=holding cost, target service/holding tradeoff is balanced; use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so OR backend applies full historical mean/variance across the full sample set. This avoids overreacting to intermittent lost shipments while letting the OR engine compute base_stock and caps from comprehensive history.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=164 \u2014 pipeline present but arrivals are only visible next period. Concluded history shows observed lead times of mostly 1\u20132 periods (examples: P4:2, P6:1, P8:2&1, P10:2&1, P13:2, P14:2, P17:2&1, P22:2), average ~1.64. Promised L=2 but concluded evidence supports a shorter average. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the mixed 1\u20132 pattern). Demand/volatility show no sustained recent regime shift (demand fluctuates but no sustained >3-period shift), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service level (using measured lead-time) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). Recent history shows one large demand spike (305 in Period 42) but no sustained multi-period regime change; on-hand=0, in-transit=164. Periods of concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 2 in prior checks, so use promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use long-run demand estimate) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock (164 units) already en route.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=175. Recent weeks show a large demand spike (Period 42=305, Period 43=157) indicating a new high-demand regime starting ~P42. Lead-time history has many confirmed 2-period arrivals; use promised/default L=2 to remain consistent with observed confirmations and OR backend expectations. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 3 demands: P41-P43) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in these recent samples. These choices prioritize service during an identified demand spike while letting the backend cap orders to control inventory risk given holding cost parity with profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=507. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 for observed arrivals and promises use L=2; recent demand shows elevated sales in Periods 42-44 (305,157,51) indicating a recent high-demand regime. To be responsive to this recent spike while remaining conservative, set L=default (promised=2) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend weights the last 3 demand observations (captures the current high-demand regime) when computing base_stock and variability. This balances service level on the current spike against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). On-hand=0, in-transit=502 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Historical concluded lead-times mostly consistent with promised L=2 (multiple arrivals show 2), and recent occasional missing arrivals appear earlier but lead time has been confirmed as 2 in concluded history. No sustained demand regime change meeting 3+ period evidence beyond seasonal spikes in Dec. To avoid overstocking given holding cost = profit, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend will compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance while respecting the pipeline cap.

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded arrivals are consistent with LT=2, so keep default L. To capture the recent high-demand regime and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses the last 6 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This biases orders toward meeting the recent surge while the large in-transit quantity (502) will cap actual ordering via the OR engine.
