Product is everyday womens leggings \u2014 relatively stable, not highly seasonal.  \nb) Demand analysis: Recent realized demand in-game: P1=92, P2=138, P3=124 \u2192 3-period average = 118 units/week, above the Jan sample (~100). This suggests a modest upward shift but not yet a sustained multi-period regime change.  \nc) Lead time / arrivals: Promised lead time = 2. Orders: P1 ordered=300, P3 ordered=60. No arrivals recorded in Period concludes (arrived=0). The P1 order would have been expected to conclude if actual lead time were 2; its non-arrival indicates actual lead time may be >2 or the shipment is delayed/lost.

Inventory/pipeline assessment: In-transit=360 would cover ~3 weeks at ~120 units/week if it arrives, but arrival timing is uncertain. Risk trade-off: placing additional order now risks creating excess holding cost if current in-transit arrives; delaying risks stockouts if those in-transit shipments are lost. Given large in-transit quantity relative to recent weekly demand and the conservative rule to await confirmed lead-time changes, I avoid ordering now and wait one more period for arrival/conclude info before committing more units.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/New Year). Holiday season can boost apparel demand, but recent history shows volatile/week-to-week demand and many stockouts. b) Demand regime: Historical early-2019 weekly demand was ~90\u2013110 when stocked; recent observed demands while stocked: P10\u2013P12 sold ~111/week; later sporadic sales when inventory existed (e.g., Nov small sales). Recent unconstrained demand observations (periods with no inventory) show demand spikes (P42=69, P43=76) but uneven. c) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded evidence shows supplier lead time = 3 periods (order P36 arrived P39). Large in-transit balance (912) persists with many earlier orders unarrived; supplier pipeline remains problematic but LT=3 is confirmed. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=912. With LT=3, those 912 units are expected to arrive over time (and have arrived previously after 3 periods). Ordering additional units risks large holding costs since pipeline already far exceeds expected near-term demand. e) Final order logic: Do not place a new order. In-transit inventory (912) already covers many weeks of demand even under a high-demand scenario and adding more risks unnecessary holding cost and potential overstock.",
