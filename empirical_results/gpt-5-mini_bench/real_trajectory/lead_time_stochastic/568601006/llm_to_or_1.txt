Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks: 161,145,179,196,186) show no sustained regime change. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock: set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given no evidence to alter forecasts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (ordered Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand samples (161,145,179,196,186) mean=173.4. I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the OR engine anchored to long-run weekly demand while accounting for 2-period lead time; it avoids overreacting to a single non-arrival which may be on-time under promised LT.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, In-transit=437 (orders from P1 and P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals yet so insufficient evidence to change lead-time estimate or declare lost shipments. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Demand history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=173.4; use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to reflect the 3-period review+lead demand. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to capture historical variability. This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding premature increases to forecasts given delayed but unconfirmed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent weekly demand samples mean=173.4 (samples: 161,145,179,196,186). On-hand=0, in-transit=711 which exceeds (1+promised_L)*mean demand (3*173.4\u2248520) so pipeline covers the review+lead demand. Three past orders (207,230,274) have not concluded yet; this could be delay or loss but we have only one missed arrival window so not enough evidence to change lead-time. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend caps orders against pipeline and balances service vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4050.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent conclude shows the Period 2 order (230) arrived in Period 4 with observed lead_time=2. On-hand=16, in-transit=484 (includes outstanding orders from Periods 1,3,5 etc.). Period 1 order did not conclude on-time (possible loss), but we have a confirmed lead time observation (P2\u2192P4). I therefore set L using 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (evidence supports L=2). Demand history (five weekly samples Jan\u2013Feb 2019) is limited but stable; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a forecast that balances service level with holding cost given confirmed L=2 and substantial in-transit inventory. This avoids overreacting to a possibly lost single shipment while honoring the observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, observed lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=697. Historical Jan samples (mean 173.4) are much lower than recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-5 mean = 227.6), indicating a sustained upward demand regime since Feb. We have one confirmed observed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Set L via "calculate" to use observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean over the last 5 weeks (covers the new regime); for volatility use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices help the OR backend raise base-stock to meet higher recent demand while using confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given past delayed arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weekly demand ~173 units (historical samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=565 (covers multiple weeks). Observed lead times: P2->P4 = 2, P5->P6 = 1 (avg=1.5). Use calculated average lead time to let backend blend observed lead-time evidence. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps forecast grounded in full history while scaling for inferred lead time). This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by increasing coverage modestly for L>1 without overreacting to short-term noise. No overdue/lost shipments currently flagged (in-transit large).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=711. Concluded lead-time observations: orders showed 2 and 1 period(s) (avg=1.5), so use calculated average to reflect observed variability. Demand recently elevated vs Jan samples (recent weeks ~198\u2013215); I use recent_N=5 to capture the latest regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) so I use recent_N to capture the short-run mean lead time. Demand has stepped up vs. the Jan samples: recent demands (Periods 4\u20138) \u2248 [214,215,215,186,249], so I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility. This keeps pipeline cover responsive to the elevated demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=712 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have toggled 1\u20132 periods (observed W values: 2,1,2,1) so I use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 215,215,186,249,178) is materially higher than the early sample set, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while relying on the large in-transit volume to limit new ordering and thus holding cost exposure.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent on-hand=98, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1 and 2 periods (observed lead_times = 2,1,2,1,1); I'll let the backend compute the average lead time from observations. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 215,186,249,178,130) indicates a mean ~191.6 and moderate variability; to capture the most relevant regime I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the latest pattern. Using these parameters balances service (covering (1+L) periods of demand based on recent rates) against holding costs by avoiding over-reliance on older higher-volume samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand samples (historical weeks) center ~173 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=604 which is sufficient to cover multiple weeks of demand. Observed concluded lead times have varied (1 and 2); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while keeping forecasts anchored to full-sample history. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or persistent lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=699 \u2014 large pipeline relative to historical weekly mean (~173) so inventory coverage is high. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); earlier carry-over confirmed 2 at Period 5 but recent arrivals show variability. Use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current effective L from history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand over (1+L) using all samples (conservative, full-history estimate) \u2014 this avoids overreacting to recent volatility while pipeline is ample.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=593. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2) so I use recent_N for L to reflect the recent average. Demand has been ~130\u2013196 recently; I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 demand samples) to capture the current regime (mean inflated vs. the sparse Jan samples). These settings let the OR backend compute base_stock and cap with a lead-time estimate grounded in recent observed arrivals while using recent demand stats to balance high service (profit/holding => q\u22480.95) against holding costs. No new lost-shipment signal; large in-transit (593) will be reconciled by backend using the chosen L.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been variable with many stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=593 (sufficient to cover several weeks). Observed concluded lead times have varied (1 and 2 periods); I choose L via 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (leveraging available sample set) \u2014 this balances service (captures demand mean across review+lead) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory. No new sustained changepoint detected in demand or lead time that warrants an explicit override.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand samples (historical Jan-Feb) show mean ~173/wk; on-hand=0, in-transit=680 which currently covers multiple periods of demand. Past concluded messages confirm typical actual lead time around 2 (no sustained shift to another regime). I choose default lead time (promised = 2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This leverages the confirmed lead time, keeps parameterization stable given mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals, and avoids overreacting to isolated delays while the large pipeline reduces stockout risk.

Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=593 (large pipeline). Historical sample mean=173.4 (from provided samples). Carry-over confirms lead time=2 historically; promised lead time=2 so use default L to keep OR engine aligned with contract. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this yields a conservative base-stock that balances profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) given the large pipeline and uncertain late arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=671 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2); average of observed lead times ~1.5 so use calculate to let backend set L from observed data. Recent demand shows no abrupt sustained regime shift; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent behavior (periods 14-18) so the base-stock reflects current demand while accounting for the inferred lead time and large pipeline. This balances service (use recent demand) vs. holding cost (avoid inflating safety stock from older high values).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand has ranged ~118\u2013249 with no clear sustained regime shift; historical seed samples show mean ~173. On-hand=0, in-transit=593 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand so no urgent shortfall; some past orders exhibited 1\u20132 period actual lead times. I select L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std as a conservative baseline; with the large in-transit volume this avoids aggressive additional orders while maintaining service vs holding cost balance.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has fallen from earlier 160-200s to ~124 over the last 5 weeks (P16-P20 demands = 168,118,139,122,73; mean=124). On-hand=0, in-transit=660 (large pipeline). Promised lead time remains 2; historical concluded lead times show 1-2 but prior insight already confirmed L=2. I set L=default to use the promised 2 periods. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (N=5 equals the most recent 5 concluded demand samples P16-P20). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding given the large in-transit inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

Use default demand sizing so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 this leverages all data and the large in-transit volume to avoid overreacting to volatile recent sales while keeping service-level driven base-stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period actual lead times; average of observed lead times will best capture that variability, so set L=calculate. Demand has shifted since the Jan samples; use recent_N=5 to focus the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 on the most recent demand regime (last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the review+lead period. This balances higher service needs from variable lead times against holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from recent demand statistics.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=649 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals have shown inconsistent lead times (observed lead_times across concluded messages vary 1\u20132 periods). Use lead-time averaging to let backend infer actual mean L. Demand historical samples (early 2019 weekly mean \u2248173) and the long history show no clear sustained demand regime shift. Set L=calculate so backend uses observed lead times average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are applied, balancing service level vs holding cost given current high pipeline.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=649. Historical concluded lead times show a persistent 1\u20132 period pattern and earlier carry-over confirmed LT=2; no sustained shift since. Use promised/default lead time to align with supplier contract. Demand historical samples (mean \u2248173.4/week from provided series) will be scaled by (1+L) in default forecasting. Keeping default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using all samples; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to recent noise or occasional delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:

Recent concluded lead times are mixed (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,2,3], avg \u22481.64), so I let the backend compute an empirical L using observed lead-time history (method=calculate). Demand has fluctuated but shows no clear sustained regime shift; therefore use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat = default) so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service level (uses observed average lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=661. Recent demand has jumped in the last 3 periods (P26-28). Lead times observed historically vary (1\u20133); use calculated average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand, detect a recent upward regime and use the last 3 periods to set forecast (N=3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher demand. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to improve service during the apparent spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility; using calculated L lets the backend account for observed lead-time variability rather than the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 26-28: recent avg demand = 232.67 vs historical sample avg = 173.40 (+34%), evidenced by demands [146,301,251] in P26-P28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand (Periods 26-28) shows a confirmed upward regime: avg 232.67 vs historical sample avg 173.40 (+34%). Pipeline is large (in-transit=924) and on-hand=0; several past shipments experienced variable lead times (observed 1\u20133). I set L to recent_N (N=5) to bias lead-time estimate toward the most recent observed behavior (captures recent 1\u20133 variability, avg ~1.8). For demand I use recent_N N=3 to explicitly target the new higher-demand regime (Periods 26-28) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service under the confirmed demand uplift while keeping safety scaled to recent variability; large in-transit inventory reduces immediate ordering pressure and the OR cap will limit excess orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent weeks show a sustained demand uplift: P26-P30 demands = [146,301,251,231,357]. On-hand=0, in-transit=856 (large pipeline; some past orders experienced lead_time=3 or were delayed). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times used to set L via 'calculate' to reflect realized variability. Demand forecast set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses P26\u2013P30). Volatility also set recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased variability. These choices raise target base stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained spike while the large in-transit position limits over-ordering risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and extended through Period 30: Periods 26\u201330 avg demand = 257.2 vs historical sample avg = 173.40 (+48%), evidenced by demands [146,301,251,231,357].

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent data shows a sustained higher-demand regime: Periods 26\u201330 avg demand = 257.2 vs historical sample avg = 173.4 (+48%). On-hand=0, in-transit=997 \u2014 large pipeline but past arrivals have been variable (observed lead times mixed, some 3-period delays). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirically observed lead-time average (captures recent mix of 1\u20133 period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L) forecast on the confirmed elevated demand regime (Periods 26\u201330). Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while letting the OR backend cap orders using its cap; using recent samples avoids understocking from relying on older low-demand history.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=1526. Historical baseline mean \u2248173.4 (early samples) but demand has clearly shifted upward from Period 26 onward (periods 26\u201334 show elevated demands: [146,301,251,231,357,328,341,612,313]). Observed concluded lead times vary (sampled lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,2,3,3,2,1], avg\u22481.71). Given mixed lead-time evidence, use calculated average lead time to capture variation. Demand appears to have a sustained higher regime starting at Period 26; use recent_N for mu_hat to reflect elevated mean over the last 9 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201334) and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture increased volatility. These parameters will raise the backend base-stock to meet higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline (1526) will be reconciled by the OR engine when arrivals conclude.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 31\u201336 demands = [328,341,612,313,283,282], recent mean \u2248 360). On-hand=0, in-transit=1315 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (multiple 3-period observations recently) so use calculated average lead time from history. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility; this helps the OR backend raise the base stock to meet higher demand while cap and large in-transit stock limit excessive new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=1438. Recent periods (P26\u2013P37) show a sustained, higher-demand regime vs historical samples; recent lead times have been variable with multiple 3-period observations. To capture the recent demand spike and the most-recent lead-time behavior I use recent_N=5 for mu and sigma (focus on last 5 demand samples) and recent_N=5 for L to estimate current effective lead time from the last 5 observed lead times. This raises the OR backend forecast to cover the (1+L) review+lead window against elevated demand while sigma recent_N tightens variability around the current regime. The large in-transit position reduces immediate ordering urgency but parameters reflect elevated demand to avoid stockouts when shipments conclude.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift extended through Period 37: Periods 26\u201337 avg demand = 313.17 vs historical sample avg = 173.40 (+80.6%), evidenced by demands [146,301,251,231,357,328,341,612,313,283,282,313].

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1362. Historical samples show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201337 avg \u2248313, >> historical avg 173). Lead times observed vary but earlier confirmed as 2; however recent concludes show variability (1\u20133). I set L via 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201337) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and volatility over the current review+lead horizon. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but very high recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1362 \u2014 large pipeline already covering multiple future periods. Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201337 avg \u2248313, well above historical mean 173). No new confirmed change since Period 38. Use promised lead time (default behavior) while forecasting demand using the recent high-demand regime (12-period window: Periods 26\u201337) so the backend sizes base-stock to meet the elevated demand; match sigma to the same recent window to reflect elevated volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime established from Period 26\u201337 (large, sustained jump vs historical samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=1362 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are observed with variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods). I set L by averaging all observed lead times to reflect that variability (so backend uses an informed effective lead time). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201337, 12 periods) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the sustained high-demand regime while recognizing pipeline already carries substantial units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since P26 (Periods 26\u201337 avg = 313.17 vs historical sample avg = 173.40, +80.6%). Multiple observed lead times show a persistent 3-period delivery pattern in recent history. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1362 (large pipeline). To account for the sustained higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (N=12). For lead time I use recent_N over recent observed lead times (N=6) to bias the OR engine toward the empirically longer lead times seen recently. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service during the elevated-demand regime while using recent volatility to temper over-ordering given the large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P23 order arrived P26 lead_time=3; P27->P30 lead_time=3; P32->P35 lead_time=3; P33->P36 lead_time=3).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 26 (multiple weeks of 200+ and a 733 spike in P42); pipeline is large (in-transit=1362, on-hand=0) which should cover several high-demand weeks. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly show multi-period delays, and recent conclude patterns (P23->P26, P27->P30, P32->P35, P33->P36, etc.) support using the observed average lead time rather than the promised value. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 26\u201342 constitute a sustained high-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility over the new regime. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts during the elevated-demand period while the large in-transit reduces immediate overordering risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Periods 26\u201337 and confirmed lead-time = 3 periods (carry-over evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=1398 (large pipeline arriving across upcoming periods). I set L.method="calculate" to let the backend use observed lead times (evidence supports actual L=3). For demand I choose EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) so the forecast (mu_hat) emphasizes recent high but noisy weeks (Black Friday spike at P42) while smoothing older baseline samples. sigma_hat uses "default" so volatility is computed from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L), providing the OR engine a conservative uncertainty estimate. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand and longer lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1398. Historical samples show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201337 avg \u2248313 > historical 173). Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised 2. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=12 (periods 26\u201337) to capture the elevated regime: mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 12 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to capture volatility in the same regime. This increases target base-stock to cover the longer lead time and higher demand while sigma recent_N keeps safety stock responsive to current volatility given high profit vs low holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weeks show a sustained, large upward demand regime (Periods 26\u201345 average >> historical) and concluded lead-time evidence indicates shipments are arriving with 3-period lead. On-hand=0, in-transit=1884 (large pipeline that will arrive under L=3). To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3. To capture the elevated demand regime I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the last ~20 demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L) demand and higher volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given large pipeline and high profit/holding ratio.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 26 (average much higher than historical sample). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed P23->P26, P27->P30, P32->P35, P33->P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=1884 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrival confirmation lags by one period, so treat lead time as 3 to ensure orders cover the longer horizon. I set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for the observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the elevated recent regime (gives (1+L)*mean over last 20 demands). For volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise target base-stock and safety stock to better meet the sustained higher demand while accounting for longer confirmed lead time and avoiding lost-shipment underordering.
