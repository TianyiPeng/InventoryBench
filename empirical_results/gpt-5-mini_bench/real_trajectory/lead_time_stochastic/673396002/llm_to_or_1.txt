Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [407,374,295,130,213], mean=283.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time change or lost shipments. No clear sustained regime shift (only 5 samples, one low week). Use promised lead time and population defaults so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)*mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This keeps forecasting conservative given zero inventory and no evidence of lead-time or demand regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent weekly demand samples average 303.8 units (5-sample mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals observed yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. I use default L (promised lead time) because only concluded messages can confirm lead-time shifts. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging all historical data) which balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change. This keeps pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods while avoiding premature adjustments based on unconfirmed arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=283.8, std\u2248102.1. On-hand=0, in-transit=931 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time is 2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so do not infer a lead-time shift. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default mu_hat ( (1+L)\xd7mean ) to reflect the multi-period demand (captures review+lead demand). Use default sigma_hat ( \u221a(1+L)\xd7std ) to represent aggregated variability. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1 by letting the OR engine compute the appropriate z based on cost ratio while accounting for the 3-period demand aggregate.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples avg=283.8 units (5 samples). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (472,459,133) have not concluded (arrived=0) despite promised L=2 \u2192 sustained delivery failure for 3 consecutive periods. To be conservative, set lead time explicitly longer so the backend plans more pipeline cover. Chosen L: explicit 4 to cover observed multi-period delays. mu_hat: default so backend computes (1+L)*mean using L=4 (captures longer coverage). sigma_hat: default to scale variability by sqrt(1+L). This increases order targets to protect service level given missing arrivals while backend's capped order prevents extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals for orders placed P1-P3 (ordered 472,459,133; arrived=0) \u2014 sustained delivery failure over 3 periods; treat actual lead time as longer than promised (estimate ~4 periods).

Daily Profit: $5966.00, Daily Holding Cost: $145.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $5821.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent conclude shows Period 2 order (459) arrived in Period 4 => observed lead time = 2. On-hand=145, in-transit=1024 (some earlier orders saw delayed/no arrivals but we now have confirmed a 2-period arrival). I choose L='calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (observed=2) rather than promised blind default; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (five weekly samples), capturing baseline demand while keeping safety stock driven by backend service-level math. This balances service (use confirmed lead time) vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and healthy in-transit inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=49, in-transit=1024. Historical demand samples and recent periods show elevated and variable weekly demand (recent demands: P1-5 = 115,169,140,314,96). Multiple past shipments experienced long delays/losses; to be conservative we set lead time explicitly longer than promised to cover delayed arrivals. I choose L explicit=4 to reflect sustained multi-period delivery failures; mu_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent mixed-demand regime across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings push the OR backend to hold more safety stock given longer effective lead time and recent high variance, balancing lost-sales cost (profit=$19) against holding cost ($1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=1104. History shows multiple delayed/missing arrivals (orders from P1\u2013P3 not visible until P4, suggesting deliveries have been unreliable). To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments, I set lead time longer than promised to cover late arrivals and avoid stockouts. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes demand across the review+lead period using all available demand history; this balances higher safety stock from the increased L against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand (Periods 3-7) shows mean ~163/week with volatile spikes (P4=314). On-hand=0, in-transit=1495 (large pipeline but many past orders were delayed/lost). Multiple earlier orders (P1-P3) saw no immediate arrivals and some arrivals only much later, indicating actual lead time > promised. To protect service with the observed higher recent demand and suspected extended lead time, I set L explicitly to 4 (estimate from sustained multi-period delivery failures). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (Periods 3-7 mean ~162.8; (1+L)*mean \u2248 814) and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of recent demand while acknowledging pipeline; they prioritize avoiding stockouts given long/uncertain deliveries while accepting some holding cost.

Recent concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 no sustained shift from promised 2; earlier multi-period non-arrivals noted but subsequent concludes show typical ~2. Demand history (weekly samples) used for base-stock. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use empirical lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline and modest holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-15. Recent demand volatile with spikes (P4=314, P8=239) but last 5 periods show moderate mean. On-hand=145, in-transit=1024 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2 (P2), P8:2 (P6), P8:1 (P7)}; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To be responsive to recent demand regime while limiting noise from older weeks, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5 = periods P5\u2013P9). This balances service-level for upcoming (L+1)-period demand against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded lead times: P2=2, P6=2, P7=1 \u2192 recent average ~1.67. On-hand=85, in-transit=1024 (large pipeline). Demand history (most recent 5 periods P6-P10): [134,130,239,87,60] shows moderate mean with volatility and a recent dip. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time behavior rather than the promised 2 or earlier lost shipments. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (uses last 5 actual demands), which balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit stock. These choices mitigate over-ordering from old lost-shipment signals while responding to recent demand patterns.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent observed demand has fallen vs. early-sample peaks (recent 8-period avg demand = 139.125). Historical missing arrivals (P1\u2013P3) indicate sustained delivery issues; treat lead time longer than promised to avoid under-ordering. On-hand (32) + in-transit (1024)=1056 covers ~5 periods of expected demand (5\xd7139.1\u2248695) so we can be conservative on forecast smoothing. Chosen methods: L explicit=4 to reflect sustained multi-period delivery delays; mu_hat recent_N N=8 to capture the recent lower-demand regime over the last 8 concluded periods; sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to use recent volatility. These settings reduce stockout risk given delayed/lost shipments while avoiding excessive extra safety stock because pipeline is currently large.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=1024. Historical concludes show multiple delayed arrivals and a sustained delivery failure (periods 1-3 orders did not arrive until much later), so I estimate actual lead time longer than promised and set L explicitly to 4. Demand has fallen since the early high-demand regime (recent weeks: 239,87,60,53,67), so I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk while covering the longer observed lead time and recent demand level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. On-hand=0, in-transit=1024; recent demand has been low (last 5 concluded demands: 87,60,53,67,56 \u2192 mean\u224864.6). Historical Jan samples are higher but recent 5-week regime appears the current baseline. Several past shipments showed delivery failures/delays; to be conservative I set lead time longer than promised to cover delayed arrivals. I choose L explicit=4 to protect against observed prolonged delivery issues. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest low-demand regime across the review+lead period. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining service given the long/uncertain pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/20. Recent demand has downshifted vs. Jan samples: last 6 demands (Periods 9-14) avg \u224866.5/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=1024 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple weeks, but past missing arrivals imply actual lead time > promised. I set L explicit=4 to reflect sustained delivery delays (~4 periods observed previously). For demand I use recent_N N=6 to capture the lower recent regime: mu_hat uses the last 6-week mean scaled by (1+L) to cover review+lead period. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce over-ordering under old high-mean data while accounting for prolonged lead time so the OR engine won't under-order due to unseen in-transit uncertainty.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1024; historical conclude messages show multiple prolonged non-arrivals (orders from P1\u2013P3 had arrived=0 for 3+ periods) indicating actual lead time > promised. I set L explicit=4 to reflect sustained delivery delays (~4 periods observed). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the engine scale safety stock for the longer review+lead horizon. This raises order quantities to protect service given the longer lead time while the backend cap limits excess orders to control holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Demand history shows intermittent arrivals and multiple lost/delayed shipments (notably P1/P3 never concluded and many periods with zero arrivals despite orders). On-hand=0, in-transit=1279 \u2014 pipeline is large but unreliable. Carry-over previously noted sustained delivery failures; to protect service while accounting for late/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly longer (L=4) so the OR backend will plan for a longer pipeline coverage. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it incorporate full historical variability while the longer L raises required coverage to reduce stockouts given unreliable arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1093. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,2,1,1} (orders P2,P6,P7,P16); earlier missing arrivals noted but later arrivals show variable 1\u20132 periods. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (captures observed variability). Demand forecast uses mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while the calculated L adjusts the replenishment horizon. This balances high profit (profit/(profit+holding)=0.95 \u2192 high service target) against holding cost by keeping default demand-based uncertainty scaling and using observed lead time average rather than the promised value.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been high and volatile (notable spikes: P15=309, P16=376, P17=412, P18=338). On-hand=0, in-transit=1093 \u2014 large pipeline but past history shows both 1\u20132 period arrivals and earlier prolonged gaps. Use observed lead-time average (calculate) to let backend infer typical lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default demand/volatility to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set so the large pipeline and longer effective review+lead window are reflected, avoiding over-reacting to recent spikes while accounting for lead-time uncertainty.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has shifted upward (periods 15-19 demands: 309,376,412,338,533) indicating a new high-demand regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=1093. For lead time I let the backend calculate average from observed concluded lead times to reflect mixed 1-2 period observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (covers the last 6 demand observations including the spike to 533). I apply recent_N to sigma_hat as well so variability reflects the recent volatile regime. These choices push the OR base-stock toward higher coverage of the current elevated demand while using observed lead-time history rather than the promised lead time, balancing service level vs. holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Multiple recent shipments have been delayed/arrived late, so I set lead time longer than promised to protect service.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand is high and volatile (last 5 demands: 338,533,431,385,296; mean\u2248396.6) and pipeline is very large (on-hand=64, in-transit=1805) with prior sustained delivery failures recorded. Use explicit longer lead time to protect against repeated lost/delayed shipments. Set L explicit=4 (captures carry-over estimate of ~4 periods). For demand forecast use recent_N=5 to reflect the current high-demand regime (mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). For volatility use recent_N=5 to reflect recent variance for the (1+L) period aggregation. These choices raise target base-stock to maintain service during prolonged delivery disruption while relying on recent high-demand samples to avoid underforecasting.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=291, in-transit=1544. Recent concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods (observed lead times from concluded messages: 1 or 2), so I will let the backend compute an empirical average lead time. Demand has shifted to a higher recent regime (recent weekly demands ~338,533,431,385,296,275,210); to capture the current demand level I use a recent_N forecast over the last 7 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These parameters balance service (by using recent demand) against holding cost (avoiding inflated long-term averages).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=132, in-transit=1544; profit/holding = 19/1 so high service focus but holding cost still matters. Historical concludes show repeated delivery failures earlier and a prior sustained pattern suggesting actual lead time longer than promised; recent arrivals are variable but pipeline is large. I set L explicitly to 4 to reflect sustained multi-period delivery delays (prevents under-ordering given delayed arrivals). Demand has stepped up in recent months (Periods 20-25 demands = 431,385,296,275,210,159; recent mean ~292). To capture the current regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (covers the most recent high-demand regime). I match sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the OR base-stock to protect service given longer effective lead time while using recent demand stats to limit excess holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=409, in-transit=1258 (pipeline=1667) - ample coverage vs recent weekly demands. Observed concluded lead times (from history) average ~1.75 periods with occasional 3-period delays; no new sustained lead-time shift confirmed this period. Use calculated average lead time so backend adapts to observed variability. Use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since recent demand history shows variability but no clear, sustained regime change requiring a recent_N or EWMA update. These choices balance service (by using observed average L) against holding cost by keeping mu_hat/sigma_hat at population estimates.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W in concluded messages: 2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3 \u2192 avg\u22481.75) and there have been past prolonged delivery failures noted earlier. I select L via 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (best evidence-based estimate). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level (using data-driven lead time) against holding cost without overfitting short recent spikes. This approach keeps parameters conservative given mixed lead-time evidence and substantial pipeline inventory.

Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3 -> avg ~1.75) so I do not force a longer lead time than promised; use calculated recent-average lead-time signal. Demand has trended up recently (last 8 periods demand mean ~282.5 vs earlier lower periods), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 8 samples to capture the higher recent demand and volatility. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while reflecting elevated recent demand, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=1258. Historical conclues show highly variable and at-times prolonged deliveries (previous carry-over flagged sustained failures and estimated lead_time ~4). To be conservative vs. missed/late arrivals and because in-transit is large but uncertain, I set lead time explicitly to 4 periods. Demand has risen recently (last 5 weeks: 159,174,219,422,544) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. Volatility also appears elevated recently, so I use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during extended/irregular lead times while relying on recent demand to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=1843 with large outstanding arrivals (ordered P30 arrived=0). Recent demand has shifted upward: Periods 26-30 demands = [174,219,422,544,491] (sustained higher mean vs earlier sample). Multiple late/no arrivals in prior periods suggest actual lead time > promised; carry-over already flagged persistent delivery failures. I set L explicit=4 to reflect longer realized lead time (~4 periods) so the OR engine will plan for a longer pipeline. For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 26-30) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing mu_hat. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service against delayed arrivals while using recent demand stats to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

Historical shipment failures earlier warrant treating actual lead time longer than promised. Set L explicit=4 to cover observed prolonged delivery lag. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 => forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean to reflect the current high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent weekly demand is elevated (recent samples: 422,544,491,354,257, etc.) and on-hand=942 with in-transit=1297. Several past shipments showed variable lead times (1\u20133+ periods) including earlier multi-period failures, but recent concluded arrivals are mostly within 1\u20133 periods. I set L method to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to bias mu_hat to the current higher-demand regime (last 10 samples reflect sustained higher weekly demand). I similarly use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to maintain service during the longer, variable lead-time episodes while keeping holding costs informed by recent demand variation.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show multiple late/zero arrivals (orders from P1-P3 arrived=0 then P2 later arrived at lead_time=2; multiple later orders also delayed; pattern from earlier carry-over indicates sustained delivery failures). I therefore treat actual lead time longer than promised and set L explicitly to 4 to capture delayed arrivals. Demand recently has been elevated and variable (recent concluded demands: P29-P33 = 544,491,354,257,369); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend weights the most recent demand behavior when computing base_stock and cap. These choices aim to avoid stockouts from delayed shipments while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window for volatility and mean.

I set L explicitly to 4 to protect against lost/delayed shipments so pipeline covers longer transit. Demand recently elevated and variable (many demands in mid-year weeks, recent weeks: 222,369,257,491,354, etc.); I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the latest regime and variance, improving service while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1.

Date 2019-10-14. On-hand=228, in-transit=1825. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133, occasional lost early shipments) so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes. Use calculate for L to capture that observed average (~1.8). Use default demand and volatility scaling so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service vs holding given large pipeline and avoids overfitting to recent spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). SKU 673396002 has on-hand=74, in-transit=1825, profit=19, holding=1. Historical concluded lead times (observed arrivals) average \u22481.8 with intermittent 1\u20133 period deliveries but earlier sustained missing arrivals; to be conservative and let backend infer from observed conclude history I choose L='calculate' (use average observed lead time). Demand forecast and uncertainty will use the backend's defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' to leverage full sample history and let the capped ordering logic balance service vs holding given the large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=1825. Historical concluded arrivals show variable and often-delayed shipments (multiple >2-period arrivals and earlier sustained missing arrivals). I estimate actual lead time longer than promised and set L explicit=4 to protect against delayed/lost shipments. Demand in recent weeks elevated and variable (recent demands: P32-P37 = 257,369,222,162,154,157); I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime. With (1+L)=5, recent_N mean implies pipeline (1825) comfortably covers the next 5-period demand (~5\xd7recent mean), so ordering will be conservative but avoid stockouts while controlling holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. History shows repeated multi-period shipment delays (periods 1-3 orders not arriving until much later, and other arrivals with 3+ periods), so actual lead time appears longer than promised. I set L explicit=4 to reflect sustained delivery delays (~3-4 periods observed). Recent demand has declined since summer; to capture the current lower-demand regime I use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand observations) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L) review+lead forecast and volatility reflect recent weeks. This increases safety stock for the longer lead time while keeping forecast tied to current lower demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1825. Historical concludes show many delayed arrivals and multi-period lead_times (observed 1\u20133 and earlier sustained failures), so I treat actual lead time longer than promised to avoid stockouts. Set L explicit to 4 to cover extended delays. Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks; using the last 5 periods (most relevant recent regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures current lower demand (reduces overstock risk while covering service needs). This balances profit vs. holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has dropped (last 5 demands: 154,157,98,96,71). On-hand=0, in-transit=1825 (many outstanding orders; historical arrivals show variable/extended lead times and earlier sustained delivery failures). I set L explicit=4 to be conservative given past multi-period missing arrivals and observed shipments arriving up to 3+ periods late; this inflates pipeline coverage used by the OR engine. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the clear recent downshift in demand and reduced volatility, so base-stock targets and caps reflect the new low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given long/uncertain lead times.

Historical concludes show multiple multi-period delivery delays and prior carry-over flagged sustained failures (orders P1\u2013P3 no arrivals then long delays). To protect service given likely longer actual lead time, I set L explicit=4 (estimate ~4 periods). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend scales demand over the (1+L) review+lead period using all historical samples; this balances higher safety stock from longer lead time against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. Recent demand (Periods 39-42) is low/steady (~96,71,72,122). Historical deliveries show sustained lost/delayed shipments early (Periods 1-4); treat lead time longer than promised to avoid stockouts. Set L explicit=4 to reflect estimated ~4-period actual lead time. Use an explicit mu_hat based on recent demand: (1+L)*mean(recent 4 periods) = 5*90.25 = 451.25 to cover the review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat explicit to capture recent volatility: sqrt(1+L)*std(recent 4) \u2248 46.66. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given long lead time and sizable in-transit) while keeping holding cost moderate.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent observed weekly demand has fallen to low levels (Dec weeks: 71,72,122,93) vs earlier mid-year peaks; on-hand=0, in-transit=1825 (large pipeline that may arrive late). Historical evidence (Periods 1\u20134 missing arrivals for 3+ periods) suggests actual lead time > promised; use explicit L=4 to buffer against delayed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (focus on the last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend sets base-stock appropriate to the recent demand and reduces holding cost exposure given large pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows prolonged delivery failures earlier (no arrivals P1\u2013P3 and multiple late arrivals), plus current in-transit=1825 undelivered\u2014evidence actual lead time > promised. I set L explicit=4 to reflect sustained multi-period delays (~4 periods observed). Demand has been low-to-moderate in recent weeks (last 5 demands: 71,72,122,93,129) so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime ((1+L) multiplier applied by backend). These choices raise target cover for the longer effective lead time while using recent demand to avoid overstock from older high-volume periods.

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). On-hand=0, in-transit=1825. Historical concluded lead times vary and multiple earlier shipments were delayed/lost; prior carry-over flagged sustained delivery failures\u2014I therefore treat lead time as longer than promised to avoid stockouts. Set L explicitly to 4 periods. For demand I use a recent_N forecast (last 5 weeks) to capture the recent upward trend into December (periods 41-45 demands = 72,122,93,129,216; mean=126.4) and scale by (1+L)=5 -> mu_hat based on recent_N N=5. For volatility I use recent_N N=5 as well to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts before/around Christmas) while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess inventory costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=1825. Historical conclude messages show multiple multi-period delivery delays and prior carry-over noted sustained failures, so I treat actual lead time as longer than promised and plan for L=4. Recent demand (Periods 42-46 = 122,93,129,216,197; mean\u2248151) drives the forecast; with review+lead=(1+L)=5, I set mu_hat = 5\xd7mean \u2248 757 to cover upcoming demand. Volatility scaled by sqrt(5) of recent std (\u224847) gives sigma_hat \u2248105 to capture demand variability and provide buffer given uncertain arrivals. These explicit choices increase on-hand coverage over the longer inferred lead time while balancing holding cost.
