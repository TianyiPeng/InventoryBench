Promised lead time=2, but we have not observed any concluded arrivals within the expected window, so actual lead time may be longer or shipments may be lost. Historical demand sample (weekly) shows mean \u2248284 units/week, but OR's recommendation (87) used promised L and treated pipeline as available; given the absence of any concluded arrivals I cannot trust in-transit as reliably arriving soon. Risk trade-off: ordering more now risks adding to a large uncertain pipeline (potentially lost or indefinitely delayed) and incurring holding cost $1/unit/period if/when it arrives; ordering too little risks stockouts if some in-transit units do arrive. Because we have 931 units in-transit (even if delayed) and a strong signal of disrupted arrivals, the conservative action is to halt new orders this period (order 0) to avoid exacerbating pipeline uncertainty and potential holding costs until we observe concluded arrivals that confirm actual lead time or arrival of outstanding shipments. I therefore override OR's 87\u21920.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows actual lead times have varied (1\u20133 periods) and one lost shipment (Period 1) already recorded in carry-over insights.

Demand outlook: recent sustained regime (Periods 36\u201345) averaged \u2248110\u2013125 units/week with one higher week (216) but no sustained uptick; calendar date 2019-12-23 could suggest modest holiday uplift but not enough to justify new purchases given pipeline. Inventory math: with L=2 (promised) we must cover (L+1)=3 future periods; 1334 units in-transit alone covers ~10+ weeks at ~120 units/week, so placing an order would only add unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history shows variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) and at least one confirmed lost shipment (Period 1). Multiple later orders have arrived but many shipments are unreliable; nonetheless the system currently reports 1,334 units in-transit. Inventory & demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=1334.

Decision logic: ordering now would incur holding cost ($1/unit/period) on top of already-large pipeline; given high in-transit volume (1334 >> expected (L+1)-period demand ~2\xd7200\u2248400) we should not add inventory and instead let pipeline arrive and reveal actual lead-time/conclude messages.
