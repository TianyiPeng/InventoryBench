Analysis: sample mean = 73.2 units/week; (L+1)*mean = 3*73.2 = 219.6 units needed to cover expected demand over the decision horizon. Recent 3-week average is much higher (avg of 65,85,137 = 95.7), indicating a sustained upward regime vs. earlier weeks (avg of first two = 39.5). Given high profit-to-holding ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile \u22480.95), stocking short is costlier than modest overstock. There are no in-transit arrivals to rely on and the upward shift is sustained for 3+ periods, so I increase supply relative to OR to protect service.

Recent realized demand in Period 1 was high (183) and prior supplied carry-over notes indicate a sustained regime shift to higher demand starting late Jan; that is noted but already recorded. OR baseline: recommends 187 units using promised L and historical samples. Adjustment reasoning: because the supplier lead-time hasn't been contradicted by any conclude message, the in-transit 220 should reduce new order needs; ordering on top of that risks excess holding (holding cost $1/unit/period) given high profit ($19) and OR already applies a high service-fractile (q\u22480.95).

Inventory position for satisfying Period 3 demand includes on-hand (0) plus arrivals occurring during Period 3 (the in-transit 407 likely includes the P1 arrival). Demand outlook: recent realized demand is very high (Period1 demand=183, Period2 demand=197) and historical samples show a late-Jan regime shift to ~96/week, but the last two observed demands indicate current weekly demand ~190. Given pipeline (407) is already large relative to a single-period demand (~190) and even relative to 3-period coverage, placing additional orders risks excess holding cost. OR recommended 101 units, but it ignores in-transit timing anomalies and uses promised LT only; ordering now would likely create surplus if both in-transit shipments arrive.
