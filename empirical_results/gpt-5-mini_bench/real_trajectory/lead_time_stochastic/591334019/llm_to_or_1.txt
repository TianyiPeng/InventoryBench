Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand samples (5) mean=120.4; with promised L=2 and no changepoint detected, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps parameters grounded in available history while avoiding premature adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly mean demand ~120.4; promised lead time = 2. Current on-hand 0, in-transit 160 (order placed Period 1 showed arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 a single-period non-arrival which is expected when actual lead time >=1, not yet evidence of loss). With (1+L)=3 review+lead periods, expected demand \u2248 3\xd7mean \u2248 361 units, so current pipeline (160) is likely insufficient. I therefore keep the backend's default lead time and demand/statistics so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*\xb7\u03c3 and caps order appropriately while the system collects more arrival/lead-time evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly demand mean = 120.4 (samples: 154,119,124,88,117). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (matches orders 160+158). Two recent orders have not yet concluded; no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time not confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend applies L=2. Use default demand/volatility (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This conservative choice relies on full-history estimates while avoiding premature adjustments based on unconfirmed lead-time shifts or missing arrivals; it keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff given available evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=419; three prior orders (P1=160, P2=158, P3=101) have not concluded as arrived in their expected conclude periods \u2014 no confirmed arrivals in Periods 1-3 conclude. This suggests shipments are delayed or lost; to be conservative I increase assumed lead time to 3 to cover extra delay when computing (1+L) demand coverage. Demand history (Jan weekly samples mean=120.4) will be used by backend via default aggregate methods. Using a longer L raises base-stock to protect service level given missing arrivals while sigma and mu use full-sample defaults so backend can compute safety stock from historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P1(160), P2(158), P3(101) have not arrived by their expected conclude periods (no arrivals reported in Periods 1-3 conclude) \u2014 possible lost shipments or extended lead time.

Daily Profit: $1368.00, Daily Holding Cost: $86.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1282.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent weekly demand samples average 120.4 units. On-hand=86, in-transit=375 but orders from P1(160) and P3(101) have not concluded -> possible lost shipments; P2 order concluded with lead_time=2. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead_time evidence (avg observed =2). No clear demand regime change (only 5 historical weeks, stable), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base stock; this balances service level with holding cost while accounting for lead-time evidence and possible missing in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4); Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P1(160) and P3(101) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude \u2014 possible lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history confirms actual observed lead time = 2 (P2 ordered P2 arrived P4). Two earlier shipments (P1=160, P3=101) remain unarrived and likely lost, but lead-time evidence is limited to concluded arrivals so use observed lead time. Demand samples (weeks of Jan\u2013Feb 2019) have mean 120.4 units/week; with review+lead =(1+L) periods, we set L via calculation to reflect observed lead times and let mu_hat/sigma_hat default to the historical sample-based defaults so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples. Current on-hand 40 + in-transit 375 appears large versus (1+L)*mean, so using defaults lets the capped policy reduce ordering given pipeline. Methods chosen: L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=2 from concluded data; mu_hat=sigma_hat default to use all samples for stability despite missing shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical demand samples (weeks in Feb): [154,119,124,88,117], mean=120.4. Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (P2 order arrived in P4). Some earlier orders (P1,P3) remain missing but not enough new sustained evidence to change promised lead time. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and recent confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand moments so the engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, letting the capped policy limit order size against pipeline. This balances service (covering 3 periods demand) vs. holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent conclues confirm actual observed lead time = 2 periods (P2\u2192P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (outstanding orders from P1,P3,P4,P7); P1(160) and P3(101) remain unconfirmed by conclude and may be lost but only one lead-time observation exists so treat lead time as 2. Demand history (samples provided) has mean 120.4/week. To cover review+lead demand and keep service given promised L=2, set L by calculate (average observed lead times =2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this yields mu_hat\u2248361.2 for L=2 and sigma_hat\u224836.4). This balances service (cover 3 periods of baseline demand) while letting backend apply its z-based safety stock given profit/holding costs; using defaults is conservative given possible lost shipments but limited confirmed lead-time data.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=375. Observed lead times: P4 conclude shows P2 order arrived with lead_time=2; P8 conclude shows P7 order arrived with lead_time=1 \u2192 mixed/unstable LT. Demand recent history (Periods 1-8) shows lower/declining demand versus earlier Jan samples. To balance service and holding cost while accounting for unstable LT and recent lower demand, set L to calculate (use observed average LT), and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast/volatility reflect the most recent 8 periods of realized demand and keep orders responsive to the recent lower-demand regime. This reduces overstock risk from earlier higher historical means and lets the OR engine adapt to the currently observed demand and lead-time variability; using calculate for L lets the backend incorporate the observed LT mix rather than the promised default.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has dropped vs. historical Jan samples (recent 5-period demands = P5-P9: 46,46,55,52,23 \u2192 mean \u224844.4), a sustained lower-demand regime (5 periods). Observed concluded lead times: one 2-period (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 variable lead time. Some earlier orders (P1,P3) appear lost. To respond: infer lead time from observed history (calculate) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the sustained lower regime; use the same recent window for volatility. This reduces overstock risk given lost shipments and lower demand while allowing the OR backend to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs. the Jan samples (Periods 4-10 demands = 72,46,46,55,52,23,17), so I use a recent-demand estimate. On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (covers outstanding orders\u2014some earlier orders missing/delayed but P2 arrival confirms lead_time=2). Set L explicit=2 to reflect confirmed 2-period lead time and avoid averaging with an isolated 1-period observation. Set mu_hat recent_N=7 to base the (1+L) forecast on the last 7 demand observations (captures the lower current regime). Set sigma_hat recent_N=7 to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-variance samples. These choices reduce over-ordering given lower observed demand while respecting confirmed lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weekly demand has been low (historical samples: 154,119,124,88,117 and recent observed demands in concludes trending 72\u219246\u219246\u219255\u219252\u219223\u219217\u219216). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (some prior orders never concluded \u2014 possible lost shipments), so I avoid forcing an explicit higher lead time. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 shows an order with lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) and Period8 shows lead_time=1 (P7\u2192P8). Because actual lead time has varied, I select L="calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times. Demand data is limited and no sustained regime shift is confirmed, so I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost while letting the OR engine incorporate the inferred average lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. History shows mixed lead-time evidence: observed lead_times = 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P7->P8); multiple earlier orders (P1,P3) never concluded (possible lost). Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 52,23,17,16,33) is materially lower than the historical sample mean (~120). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I set L using the average of the two most recent observed lead times (captures recent variability and potential shorter lead), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand periods to reflect the new lower-demand regime. These parameters let the OR backend target a lower base-stock and tighter cap, reducing overstock risk given large in-transit inventory and confirmed shipment irregularities.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 8: recent avg demand (Periods 8-12) = 28.2 vs historical sample mean = 120.4 (drop \u2248 -76.6%); maintain observation of missing/lost shipments for orders placed P1 and P3 (no arrival by expected conclude).

On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (some prior orders were delayed/lost historically). I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed concluded lead times (captures mixed evidence: observed 2 and 1 period arrivals \u2192 avg 1.5). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the new low-demand regime (Periods 8-13). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to compute volatility from the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching supply to the sustained lower demand and avoid overstock while allowing the OR engine to size safety stock for observed variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has stayed low since Period 8 (weekly demands P8-P14: 52,23,17,16,33,27,13) indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (covers several future periods). Observed concluded lead times: one 2-period (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period (P7\u2192P8) \u2192 average ~1.5. I set L to be calculated from observed leads to reflect actual behavior rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 8\u201314) to capture the post-change lower-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward the lower recent demand while acknowledging observed lead-time evidence and the substantial in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering and reduce holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (avg \u224828.2) vs historical mean \u2248120.4. Observed concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P7\u2192P8 = 1 (avg 1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (some earlier orders were delayed/lost but concluded arrivals show mixed lead times). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the lower-demand regime (Periods 8\u201315) when computing mu_hat and sigma_hat, which helps the OR backend size base stock to the new lower demand while reflecting recent volatility and avoiding overstock given holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (avg Periods 8-16 \u2248 28.2 vs historical sample mean 120.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (large pipeline but some earlier shipments were delayed/lost). Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), P8 shows LT=1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 variable. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (lets it infer the mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=9, Periods 8\u201316) to reflect the sustained downshift in demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 to capture recent lower variability. These choices reduce target stock relative to historical levels while letting the backend account for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit volume.

Set L by observed lead times to reflect actual behavior (average of concluded lead times = 1.5) using 'calculate' so backend adapts to observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 8-17) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N N=10 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk versus using long-run high historical mean while accounting for actual lead-time evidence and in-transit uncertainty.

I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (covers Periods 8\u201319, the detected low-demand regime length) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which reduces recommended orders to avoid excess holding cost given the sustained demand drop.

On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (large pipeline likely includes older unconfirmed shipments). Promised lead time is 2 and earlier concluded arrivals support L\u22482; I will use default promised lead time. To capture the sustained low-demand regime, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (Periods 8\u201320, regime_length=13 \u2192 N=13).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 22). Several early orders (P1,P3) never concluded\u2014treat as lost but recent concluded lead times are 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P7->P8). I set L to calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=15, Periods 8\u201322) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime and reduced volatility; this keeps base_stock aligned with current demand and limits excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19. This also mitigates risk from overdue/lost early shipments by relying on recent realized demand rather than historical high samples.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (Periods 8-23 recent avg \u224828.2 vs historical sample mean 120.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (examples: P2\u2192P4=2, P7\u2192P8=1) so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N over the full detected low-demand regime (Periods 8-23, N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the sustained drop and avoid over-ordering given large in-transit stock; this balances service vs holding cost and mitigates risk from possible missing shipments by relying on observed arrivals rather than assuming higher historical demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (sustained low weekly sales, recent samples show much lower mean than historical early-2019). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 provides substantial pipeline cover. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2); I ask the backend to compute the empirical average lead time from concluded history. For demand I use the recent low-demand regime (Periods 8\u201324, N=17) to scale the (1+L) forecast; same recent window for volatility so the OR base-stock and cap reflect the current low-demand, low-variance regime and avoid excess holding costs while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical arrivals show observed lead times of 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2192 average ~1.5; promised LT is 2. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 8 (sustained drop). To reflect the confirmed shorter/variable observed lead time while letting the backend compute using observed history, set L method to calculate (average observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 8\u201325) to capture the persistent lower demand; set mu_hat recent_N N=18 and sigma_hat recent_N N=18 so the OR engine builds base_stock and caps from the recent low-demand mean and volatility. This balances service (covering current low demand) and holding cost given large in-transit volume and reduced demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (sustained low weekly sales vs. the Jan historical samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (pipeline large). No new lead-time conclues since earlier confirmation; promised lead time retained. I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N to capture the low-demand regime using the most recent contiguous regime (Periods 8\u201326, length 19) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses the recent std; this reduces orders relative to historical January samples and avoids excess holding cost given large in-transit inventory. N=19 chosen because the demand regime starting Period 8 is sustained and includes 19 available recent samples (Periods 8\u201326).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 8 (carry-over: avg P8-12=28.2 vs historical sample mean=120.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows P2 order lead_time=2, P8 shows P7 order lead_time=1 => variable actual lead time. To reflect observed variability in arrivals use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Because demand regime shifted down starting Period 8, forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data from the low-demand regime (recent_N, N=20 covering Periods 8-27) so the order quantity targets the current low-demand regime while accounting for pipeline. This reduces overstock risk given large in-transit and low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical sample mean=120.4 (provided). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 no sustained new lead-time regime, so use calculated average of observed lead times to let backend infer current effective L. Use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean & sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because the long-run sample mean seeds the forecast and in-transit inventory (375) already provides multi-period cover; avoid overreacting to recent noisy spikes. These choices balance service (by letting L reflect observed delays) against holding cost (by using baseline mu_hat and sigma_hat rather than inflating safety stock).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical evidence: earlier confirmed lead time=2 (Period2\u2192P4) and intermittent 1 (Period7\u2192P8); no new sustained lead-time change. Demand has been low mid-year (Periods 8\u201312) but recent weeks (Periods 23\u201329) show higher activity (25,47,79,48,48 etc.); I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture this uptick while keeping promised lead time. Chosen methods: L=default to trust promised lead time (no sustained lead-time shift); mu_hat=recent_N to reflect recent demand regime (use last 7 periods to capture recent spike); sigma_hat=recent_N to measure volatility over same recent window. This raises target base-stock to meet recent demand while limiting holding cost exposure by using a short recent window.

Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8) so average actual lead time \u22481.5 \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand regime dropped after Period 7 and then showed recent uptick (last 5 demands = 47,79,48,48,130); this recent variability and spike justify using a short recent window to set demand forecast and volatility (capture current trend while remaining responsive). Missing/delayed shipments from early periods remain noted but recent concludes show some arrivals, so do not force explicit longer L. Parameters chosen to balance service (respond to recent demand rise) vs holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than long-run mean.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical long-run mean=120.4 but demand has recently risen (Periods 26-31 = 47,79,48,48,130,136; recent mean \u224881.33). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; no new evidence to change it. I therefore use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecasts based on the recent uptick using the last 6 periods to capture the renewed demand level (N=6). This keeps mu_hat responsive to the recent spike while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility; the backend will combine these with L and pipeline to compute orders while our large in-transit (375) will reduce net ordering.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Recent concluded lead times observed = {P4:2, P8:1} \u2192 mixed evidence; using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has rebounded in recent weeks (Periods 28-32 = 48,48,130,136,162) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-mean, higher-variance regime and avoid diluting with earlier low-demand periods. This keeps the base-stock responsive to recent surge while the OR engine caps orders; large in-transit (375) will be compared to pipeline by backend to avoid excess ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick starting Period 28: avg(Periods 28-32)=104.8 vs prior recent avg(Periods 8-12)=28.2 (increase \u2248 +272%), sustained for 5 periods.

On-hand=0 but in-transit=687 units \u2014 large pipeline covers several periods, so aggressive safety stock not needed beyond accounting for higher recent demand. Promised lead time remains 2; no new concluded lead-time evidence since Period 8/4, so use default promised L. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the demand uptick (backend will scale by 1+L). Set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service for the recent surge while relying on substantial in-transit stock to limit holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has strongly increased since Period 28 (periods 31-35 demands = 136,162,307,180,188; recent mean \u2248194.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=755 (sizable pipeline). Observed lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods); use calculate so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (reduces understock risk). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) so variability reflects the recent spike. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while relying on large in-transit to limit extra ordering; calculated L lets the backend reconcile actual observed lead times versus promised.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand has jumped sharply since Period 30 (Periods 30-36: 130,136,162,307,180,188,126) while on-hand=34 and in-transit=612. Lead times observed vary (1,2,3) but not yet a sustained LT change; use calculated average LT to let backend smooth variability. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7 demand samples (Periods 30-36). This raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new demand regime while using recent variance to size safety stock and avoid over/under-stocking given volatile arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg(Periods 30-36)=175.57 vs prior recent avg(Periods 28-32)=104.8 (+67.6%) \u2014 sustained high demand for 7 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=672. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed W={2 (P2->P4),1 (P7->P8),3 (P33->P36),1 (P35->P36)}) and some lost/long-delayed earlier shipments (P1,P3). Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 30 (multiple periods with demand >> historical sample mean). To account for uncertain actual lead time use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent data from the sustained high-demand regime \u2014 use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent 7-week high-demand pattern for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices let the OR engine size base stock to cover (1+L) periods under the elevated demand while the calculated L reflects observed lead-time variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 30 (Periods 33-38 mean demand \u2248195.7). Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed LT = [2,1,3,1,1]); in-transit=665 units likely includes multiple outstanding shipments. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set L to the average of observed lead times (to reflect variable/shorter-than-promised behavior) and base demand estimates on the most recent 6 demand observations (Periods 33-38) so the OR backend targets service for the current high-demand level while sigma uses the same 6 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been high and sustained since Period 30; average demand over Periods 33-39 \u2248 185.4/week (vs earlier low regime ~28). On-hand=0, in-transit=741 (pipeline large but arrivals have shown variable lead times and some delays). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,3,1,1,3] \u2192 average \u2248 1.83. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average; mu_hat recent_N using the most recent 7 concluded demand samples (Periods 33-39) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 30 (sustained high weekly demand ~165 units recent average). On-hand=0, in-transit=741 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals have shown variable lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,3,1,3). I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times average (supports variable actual lead-time). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 30\u201340) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean(recent 11 samples) so the base-stock targets cover review+lead demand under the new regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while relying on existing large in-transit to limit excess new ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained elevated demand regime starting around Period 30 (carry-over notes). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals = {2,1,3,1,3,2} \u2192 average 2.0. On-hand=22, in-transit=648 (sufficient pipeline). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent demand stats from the most recent regime (length 7 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current volatility; for lead time I use the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect actual observations. These choices help the OR backend target service under observed lead-time variability while avoiding excess holding by using recent demand estimates.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=648. Recent concluded lead-time observations (periods with arrivals) show variable L but recent average is ~2.0. Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime since Period 30 (recent weeks show much higher demand vs earlier). I set L via recent_N to capture the latest lead-time behavior (use last 5 observed lead times which avg \u22482). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand periods: P36\u2013P42) to reflect the current high-demand regime; the backend will scale by (1+L). These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has returned to the higher regime that began around Period 30; last 7 demands avg \u2248126 units/week and recent volatility is elevated. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,3,3,1,2] (avg=2.0) so I use calculated lead time to reflect actual observations rather than the single promised value. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast and variance on the sustained post-Period-30 regime (captures increased mean and volatility) so the OR engine orders enough to meet higher service needs while capping orders via its cap rule to limit excess holding cost given some earlier lost/delayed shipments.

Recent demand (Periods 40-44) = [95,71,149,71,60], recent mean \u2248 89.2; demand has moderated from prior peaks, so forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean via recent_N to capture current regime. Volatility also driven by recent spikes, so use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect short-run variability. These choices keep orders responsive to current demand while the large in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering urgency and helps guard against lost shipments.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,3,1,3,1,2} -> average \u22481.86; therefore use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt to observed variability. Given very large in-transit inventory, keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses full-sample demand statistics scaled by (1+L) to avoid overreacting to recent volatile spikes. This balances service (use observed L) against holding cost (no aggressive up-weighting of recent high demand).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=648. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed Ls = 2,1,3,1,3,2,1) suggesting actual lead time \u22481.86 but still variable and intermittently longer than promised 2. Demand has experienced multiple regime shifts; most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 42-46) = [149,71,60,59,42], recent mean \u224880.2 which is the best short-term forecast. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to anchor forecast to latest demand regime and capture current elevated variability; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings keep orders responsive to recent demand while accounting for variable/occasionally-extended lead times and the large in-transit position (648) to avoid over-ordering.
