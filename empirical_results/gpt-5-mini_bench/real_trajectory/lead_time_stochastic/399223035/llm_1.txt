Lead time / arrivals: historical evidence includes variable arrivals (LT observed 1\u20133) but lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period 19 evidence). Current pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=750 (large). Risk: holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit margin $1/unit, so carrying inventory strongly penalizes ending inventory. Given a very large in-transit pipeline that\u2014if it arrives\u2014will cover many future periods, and high per-unit holding cost that erodes any profit, do not add inventory now. Ordering more risks negative contribution from holding cost if shipments arrive on schedule. With no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change signaled in concluded history, be conservative and place no new order this period.",
