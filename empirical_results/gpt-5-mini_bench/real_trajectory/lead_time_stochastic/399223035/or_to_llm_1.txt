Recent demand profile: carry-over insight documents a sustained higher-demand regime (~115) earlier, but latest weeks show variable weekly demand (19\u201390) with several ~80\u201390 weeks; using a conservative weekly demand estimate of 90 would still exhaust 1560 units over ~17 weeks.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed earlier) and several past shipments were lost/delayed, so treat the large in-transit number as unreliable until new arrivals are observed. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 72. Recent demands (Periods 41\u201346 = 41,90,19,26,89,72) average \u224856/week; (L+1)=3 periods implies expected demand \u2248168 units. Pipeline cannot be trusted fully and orders placed now will arrive after 2 periods (usable for Period 50 demand and onward), so we should top up inventory to reduce stockout risk once new arrivals land. OR recommends 0 (it uses promised L and historical mean), but given higher recent volatility and the need to cover multi-period demand once new stock arrives, I place a modest replenishment. Final strategy: order 100 units to move toward covering the (L+1)-period demand shortfall (168 target \u2212 72 on-hand \u2248 96), keeping the order small to limit holding cost if demand falls or more pipeline arrives unexpectedly.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordered 100 units (vs OR=0) because on-hand 72 + unreliable pipeline likely undercovers the (L+1)=3 period demand (~168); 100 units roughly fills the shortfall while limiting holding cost.",
