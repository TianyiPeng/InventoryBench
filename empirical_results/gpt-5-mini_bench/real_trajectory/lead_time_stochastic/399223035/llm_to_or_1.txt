Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04): [57,73,88,73,96], mean=77, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so need to cover (1+L) periods of demand. No sustained changepoint detected; use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for safety while respecting caps.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand mean = 77.4 (samples: 57,73,88,73,96). On-hand=0, in-transit=103 (ordered P1) \u2014 with promised lead time=2 this is expected (order placed P1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 3 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Use default lead time and default demand estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean to cover current + L periods; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to reflect demand variability across the review+lead horizon. This balances service level (protects against typical weekly variability) while avoiding extra holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed weekly demand jumped (most recent weeks: 96, 156, 124) vs earlier Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=251 but no concluded arrivals yet for P1/P2 orders (both arrived=0), so possible delays or lost shipments\u2014insufficient confirmed evidence to change promised lead time. I keep L=default (promised=2). To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the last 3 demand samples: 96,156,124) so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the uptick while avoiding overreacting to a single week spike. This raises the base-stock to improve service given in-transit uncertainty but still controls holding cost by limiting to a short recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive periods (P1\u2013P3) where orders were placed but arrived=0 when arrivals were expected under promised L=2, indicating shipments are delayed or lead time has lengthened. On-hand=0, in-transit=376 (multiple outstanding orders). To mitigate stockouts I set explicit lead time longer than promised (L=3) so the OR engine plans for a larger pipeline; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default population estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to scale demand across the review+lead period. This increases target base-stock to improve service while the longer lead-time assumption hedges against further missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133: each ordered (P1=103,P2=148,P3=125) showed arrived=0 when expected under promised L=2; suggests lead time has increased or shipments delayed (evidence sustained across 3 periods).

Daily Profit: $64.00, Daily Holding Cost: $84.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history: P2 order (148) arrived in P4 -> observed lead_time=2. On-hand=84, in-transit=228. Earlier missed arrivals (P1,P3) raised concern but P2 arrival confirms actual lead time equals promised 2. Set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times average (reflects confirmed L=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to anchor forecasts on historical weekly samples while accounting for the 1+L review+lead span; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) vs holding costs given limited new evidence of a demand regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Current on-hand=12, in-transit=228. Recent concluded messages show orders placed P1\u2013P3 initially reported as arrived=0 but P2 arrived in Period 4 (order P2 -> arrived P4), confirming actual lead time = 2 periods and that earlier missing arrivals were a transient delay rather than permanent loss. Demand history (Jan\u2013Feb samples) used as baseline; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Given confirmation of L=2, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost under the confirmed lead time and the observed pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=252; recent concludes show lead time behaving as promised L=2 (orders placed in P2 arrived in P4). Demand last 6 periods: [156,124,76,64,72,92] \u2014 no clear sustained upward regime change but recent mean (~97) and variability reflect higher early spikes then stabilization. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (2) given confirmation; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding). This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while letting the backend cap orders via its safety-cap calculation.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=292 (matches outstanding orders). Observed confirmed lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and missing arrivals earlier are likely delayed but not conclusively lost. To be robust to recent demand behavior I use recent-N demand estimates (captures recent higher variability vs. old Jan samples) and let backend compute L from observed lead times. This balances service (use recent demand mean over review+lead) versus holding cost by not inflating L or using an explicit high forecast.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=228. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1} (mix of 2 and 1). Demand has increased recently (Periods 5-8 demands = 72,92,130,113; recent mean ~101.75). To cover review+lead demand and account for observed lead-time variability, set L using recent lead-time observations (average of last 3 observed lead times) and set demand parameters using recent demand (last 4 periods) to capture the upward regime. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts given current in-transit but volatile arrivals while keeping holding risk visible to the OR cap.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=306. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward regime since early March (Period4 onward): demands P4-P9 = [64,72,92,130,113,107] (avg \u2248 96.3). Promised lead time is 2 and concluded arrivals (P4, P8) confirm L=2 overall, so I keep L as default (promised). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering P4\u2013P9) so backend computes (1+L)*mean of these recent samples; sigma_hat set to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit (306) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing orders.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed actual lead times (observed sequence: 2,2,1,1); shipments were previously delayed across P1\u2013P3 but more recent arrivals confirm variability around promised L=2. Demand recent mean is higher than the early-sample mean (last 5 demands: 92,130,113,107,86 \u2192 mean\u2248105.6). To balance service vs holding cost while hedging lead-time variability, I set L to recent_N (avg of last 3 observed lead times) to reflect the most recent lead-time mix, use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 demand samples to capture the current higher demand regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand while accounting for lead-time uncertainty from mixed observations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has risen vs. early-sample mean (recent 5-period demands avg ~108 vs. historical ~77). Pipeline shows 317 units in-transit, on-hand 0; some previous orders experienced delayed or mixed lead times (observed lead times: 2,2,1,1). I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand regime (uses last 5 observed demands). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to raise service while capping orders via backend cap to limit holding costs given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent observed lead times are mixed (observed arrivals: 2, 2, 1, 1); I use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent lead-time average (gives responsiveness to the 1\u20132 period mix). Demand has shifted up relative to the sparse Jan samples; recent demand (Periods 8\u201312) is elevated and volatile. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and scales volatility from recent behavior. This balances service level (protect against recent high weekly demand) vs holding cost by using short recent windows rather than the full long-run average.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=241. Historical observed lead times (from conclude messages) = {2,2,1,1,2} \u2014 mixed but mean ~1.6; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand shows a higher regime vs the early samples: recent 5 demands (Periods 9-13) = [107,86,104,140,97], mean \u2248106.8; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand and avoid understocking. Demand volatility appears driven by recent weeks, so set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while letting the backend account for the inferred lead time from observed concludes. Current pipeline (241) should be compared by backend to (1+L)*mu_hat when computing orders.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded lead times vary but majority indicate 2 periods (multiple orders observed with W=2); choose L via calculate to let backend use observed average rather than promised. Demand has shifted higher in recent weeks (periods 9\u201314: 107,86,104,140,97,137) \u2014 I treat this as a new higher-demand regime and use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent six demands. These parameters prioritize service (capture recent elevated demand) while keeping volatility-based buffer limited to recent variance to avoid excessive holding cost given holding=profit.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times (observed lead_times = [2,2,1,1,2,2], avg\u22481.67) so I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand samples provided (Jan\u2013Feb 2019 weeks) will be used by default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine can compute base stock and cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Some earlier sustained missed arrivals were observed but later concludes confirm arrivals (no new sustained loss signal). I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the OR backend adapt to the mixed/longer-than-promised pattern. For demand I use the default aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and volatility as default so sigma scales with sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (using higher effective L increases mu_hat to cover review+lead demand) against holding cost by letting the backend cap orders with its cap formula and modeled q (profit/(profit+holding)).

Demand samples (weeks in history) show no clear recent regime shift; returns to stock/outages are intermittent but arrivals mostly 1\u20132 periods. To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time behavior and use full-sample demand statistics, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples). This balances service (using empirical lead-time) versus holding cost by not overreacting to transient missed arrivals while leveraging all demand history.

I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals).

On-hand=0, in-transit=314 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy vs. typical weekly demand but arrivals are observed with a 1-period confirmation delay. No clear, sustained change in demand mean/variance (recent weeks show variability but not a 3+ period regime shift), so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These choices let the OR engine balance service level vs. holding cost while incorporating empirical lead-time averaging.

Demand samples (weekly) available from Feb 2019; no clear sustained demand regime change. To let the OR engine infer L from observed concludes and compute demand aggregates consistently, use 'calculate' for L and defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Profit and holding cost equal ($1), so target service level q = 0.5; use conservative default statistics and promised lead time so OR backend uses full historical mean/variance. Methods chosen: L=default to trust promised lead time (supported by observed P->P+2 arrivals), mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing fill rate vs holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been low-to-moderate (most recent weeks: 76,84,89,38) compared with earlier peaks; on-hand=0 and in-transit=314 units. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time \u22482 periods (multiple observed P\u2192P+2 arrivals). Several earlier late/no-arrival episodes resolved; no sustained new lead-time shift since Period 5 confirmation. Given the confirmed lead time and mixed demand, use default lead time (promised) so OR backend assumes L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history while letting the OR cap/order logic temper ordering against in-transit=314. This balances service level (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding cost and accounts for existing large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,1,2,2,2} (avg \u22481.71) with most recent arrivals dominated by 2-period behavior. Recent demand (Periods 21-25) = [76,84,89,38,53], indicating a moderate recent mean (~68) lower than earlier peaks. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of all observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations). For mu_hat I choose 'recent_N' with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent regimen (captures recent lower demand). For sigma_hat I use 'recent_N' N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago high-variance samples. These choices balance service (using measured lead-time) and lower holding cost by tying forecasts to recent demand.

LLM Rationale:

Given the confirmed lead time and substantial in-transit inventory, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from history; this lets the engine apply its capped ordering logic against the large pipeline while avoiding manual over-adjustment for short-term noise or unresolved regime shifts.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed observed lead times (1s and 2s) but multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals (e.g., P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P12->P14, P15->P17). No new sustained demand regime change detected. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent observed weekly demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P24\u2013P28 = 38,53,54,79,61) averages \u224857 units/week with moderate variability. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 314 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at expected demand if L=2. Historical conclude messages show lead times of 1\u20132 but most recent confirmed pattern supports promised lead time; no strong sustained shift requiring explicit L change. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and use recent demand pattern, I set L=default so backend uses promised L, mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the most recent 5 samples (captures current regime and limits influence of older higher-demand periods). This balances service (use recent demand mean) vs holding cost (in-transit already high), while avoiding overreaction to earlier sporadic missing arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times but several confirmations of 2; recent history includes multiple concluded lead_time=2 arrivals. Pipeline (314) likely covers several weeks of demand but arrivals are only visible next period. I select L by averaging observed lead times to capture the empirical lead-time (~1.7) rather than blindly trusting the promise; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from the full sample set, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1:$1). This keeps parameters conservative given sporadic delayed/mixed arrivals and limited on-hand stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weekly demands average roughly in the historical sample range (many weeks with demand 38\u2013140, recent weeks 45\u201379). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 \u2014 large pipeline available so avoid inflating forecasts. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 in several arrivals; promised L=2 is still appropriate. I choose default methods so backend uses promised lead time and full-sample statistics: L=default to respect the promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat=default to compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) reflecting full-history demand; sigma_hat=default to compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps orders conservative given high in-transit inventory and equal profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weeks show modest weekly demand (historical samples mean ~77) and no recent concluded arrivals since Period 17; on-hand=0, in-transit=314 (pipeline large). Earlier periods showed temporary missing arrivals but Period 4/5 confirmed typical 2-period behavior. I choose to trust the promised lead time and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to full-sample mean and std. This keeps parameters conservative given a large in-transit stock and avoids overstating recent low-demand noise.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (large pipeline). Recent observed demand (Periods 28-32): 61,45,53,66,64 \u2192 recent mean ~57.8, showing a lower post-season regime vs. early-year highs. Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior evidence; no sustained lead-time drift since. I choose L=default (promised 2) because concluded history supports promised lead time and there is no new sustained delay. For demand I select recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples so the base-stock aligns to current demand levels while accounting for the 2-period lead + review. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility; with profit=holding the OR backend will set z accordingly to balance service vs holding given these inputs. The large in-transit (314) means orders placed now will add to substantial pipeline; using recent demand estimates prevents over-ordering into that pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, In-transit=314 units. Historical demand samples plus recent weeks show a modest recent regime; promised lead time was confirmed as 2 in history. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (2) consistent with confirmed observation. For mu_hat I choose recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 observed weekly demands to capture the most recent demand regime). Sigma_hat set to default so backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). With L=default and mu_hat recent_N the backend will size base-stock to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost using recent demand while sigma_default controls risk; current pipeline (314) comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods of recent demand (~65*3\u2248195), reducing need for aggressive ordering while preserving service level.

In-transit (314) is sizable versus weekly historical demand (~57\u201396 sample range). To be conservative and consistent with proven promised lead time, use default lead time (promised L=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical data and the OR engine's capped ordering to balance the 1:1 profit/holding cost tradeoff (implying neutral service/holding emphasis).

I select L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirmed as 2), and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses all demand history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (pipeline large relative to recent weekly demand ~40\u2013100). Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast and uncertainty set to defaults so backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L) for sigma_hat; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) and the large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed Period 5). Recent demand history shows no sustained shift from the historical sample set. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, hold=$1) so target service level is moderate. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) and sigma = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(samples), letting the engine balance fill-rate vs holding cost given available pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed samples: 2,2,1,1,2,2,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.71) but recent confirmed behavior supports ~2-period behavior; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Use calculated lead time to let backend reconcile observed variability; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows orders have arrived with 2-period delays (Period 4 concluded P2\u2192P4), so no persistent lead-time increase to override promised L=2. Demand history (multiple weekly samples including initial 2019-Jan series and subsequent observed demands) provides baseline; no recent sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default methods so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=3 to compute base-stock and cap, letting the optimizer balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical weekly sample mean = 77.4 (samples: 57,73,88,73,96). Periods 1\u20133 showed missing arrivals but Period 4/5 evidence confirmed actual lead time = promised 2 periods, so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with L=2 the backend will target ~3\xd7mean demand while capping orders to limit same-period risk. Current pipeline (314) exceeds the 3-period expected demand (~232), so no explicit upward adjustment needed; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (e.g., P2\u2192P4 arrival). Demand samples seed provided (mean \u224877.4). To keep the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time and long-run demand samples, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation. This balances service (use confirmed L=2) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock from long-run sample statistics and the profit/holding cost ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded lead-times repeatedly show ~2 periods; several earlier missing arrivals were already investigated and Period 4 confirmed L=2. Pipeline (314) likely covers multiple future periods; I will trust the promised lead time rather than override it. Use default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample history, letting the built-in cap and service-level formula balance profit vs holding cost.

Historical conclude messages previously confirmed actual lead time = 2 periods for observed shipments; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change in the most recent concludes. Using promised/default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) keeps parameters consistent with historical data and the OR backend's assumptions, while relying on the current in-transit stock to cover upcoming demand.

In-transit stock (314) is large relative to historical weekly demands (samples range ~19\u2013156) so no aggressive upward adjustment. Use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes a base-stock balancing profit vs holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z=0). This keeps orders conservative given confirmed L=2 and substantial pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistent with promised L=2 (recent confirmations) and prior missing arrivals do not form a new sustained shift. Use promised lead time (default). Demand samples (provided history) imply baseline mean ~77.4/week; with L=2 the backend default (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std provide a balanced base-stock for profit=holding (symmetric tradeoff).
