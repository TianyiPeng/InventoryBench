Inventory/demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=310 units \u2014 this pipeline quantity is large relative to recent single-period demand (Periods 43\u201345: 20, 29, 26) and even relative to elevated earlier regimes (Period 30\u201333 averages  ~166). Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is substantial relative to profit ($4/unit), so carrying excess inventory reduces objective. OR recommended 0 units; OR assumes promised L=2 and historical demand, but cannot see our large in-transit. Recommendation decision: Do not order (0 units). Rationale: the existing in-transit pipeline (310) is sufficient to cover several future weeks even if demand reverts to the higher sustained regimes; ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost given inventory already incoming and no confirmed new upward demand regime in the last three periods. Action: follow conservative posture and place 0 units.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Use concluded history only. Recent concluded periods show variable lead times (1\u20133) but no new evidence in Periods 44\u201346 of lost or additional delays. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, In-transit=310. Recent weekly demand (Periods 40\u201346) = [53,54,46,75,20,29,26,27], average \u224840 units/week. With promised L=2, decision must cover (L+1)=3 weeks \u2192 expected demand \u2248120 units. Pipeline (310) comfortably exceeds 3-week demand even allowing for lead-time variability or partial loss. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit) favors stocking when needed, but ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost because pipeline already large. OR recommended 0; I agree and place 0 to avoid excess holding while awaiting pipeline arrivals and to observe actual arrival patterns in upcoming conclude messages. Final strategy: follow OR (0 units); monitor arrivals next periods and only order if pipeline drops below ~120 units or if concluded messages show lost shipments.",
