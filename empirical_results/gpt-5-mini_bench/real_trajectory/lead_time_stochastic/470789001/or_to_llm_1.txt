Because multiple periods past promised lead time have no arrival, I treat the in-transit 299 as unreliable for meeting upcoming demand. Risk tradeoff: Ordering nothing risks large stockouts (expected 277 units demand over next 3 periods). Ordering full replacement risks duplication if the original shipment still arrives; but after > promised lead time without arrival, probability of loss/delay is high. Decision: cover expected (L+1)=3 period demand conservatively. Target inventory \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 277 units. Current reliable on-hand =0 and I will not count the doubtful in-transit. Therefore place order = 277 units. This aims to meet expected demand over the lead+review window, given likely lost/delayed pipeline and high stockout cost (profit>holding).

Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, carrying large inventory is costly but stockout risk is low because in-transit should cover many weeks even if some shipments are delayed. OR recommended 0 units; I accept that cap because (a) pipeline >> expected near-term demand under current lower/medium regime and (b) there is no sustained new evidence that in-transit is lost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows mixed lead times (e.g., P5\u2192P6 = 1, P8\u2192P10 = 2) and some lost/very-delayed shipments earlier (noted P1 order not concluding). Recent evidence (multiple concluded arrivals at L=1\u20132) means pipeline is real for those that have concluded; in-transit=1058 is the system-reported pipeline (includes earlier uncertain units but many subsequent arrivals have been observed). Inventory & demand: On-hand=0 but pipeline=1058 >> recent weekly demands (Periods 42\u201346: 91,59,103,94,79). Profit=$4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period implies positive margin but holding cost is material when inventory is excessive. OR recommendation=0 (capped base-stock using promised L and historical demand). Decision: follow OR and order 0 units. Rationale: current pipeline (1058) provides many weeks of coverage given recent demand levels and recent arrivals confirm much of the pipeline; placing more orders now would increase holding costs and risk overstock. Monitor concluded messages next periods to detect any lost shipments or a sustained demand regime shift and revise orders if pipeline proves smaller than reported or demand increases materially.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR: order 0. Pipeline=1058 provides many weeks of cover vs recent weekly demand (~60\u2013100); avoid extra holding cost given uncertain residual in-transit units and no confirmed need to replenish.",
