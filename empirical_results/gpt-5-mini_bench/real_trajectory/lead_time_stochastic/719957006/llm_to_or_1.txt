Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Limited history (5 weekly samples) and no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time used to avoid premature inference. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by (1+L)) and default volatility to let the OR backend compute base_stock given the promised L=2. This balances service vs holding cost given sparse data and no confirmed changepoints.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (ordered P1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb 2019) will be used. I keep L as default (promised=2) because no confirmed lead-time change. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=284; two recent orders (P1=155, P2=129) have not yet concluded but promised lead time is 2. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show mean\u224881.8 and std\u224839.8. No concluded arrivals yet so no evidence to change promised lead time or demand regime. Use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance while keeping policy conservative given in-transit stock and potential shipment delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=284; P1 order (155) and P2 order (129) remain undelivered and P1 did not show arrival by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time may exceed promised 2 or shipments delayed/lost. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative (protect against further stockouts while acknowledging missing arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent realized demand regime (period demands 21,29,53) so mu_hat reflects short-run demand ((1+L) window). Volatility likely changed with recent lower demands, so I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to let the backend compute variability from the same recent window. These choices increase target inventory to cover potential longer lead time and recent realized demand while keeping variance estimation recent to avoid overstock from older high historic samples.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
719957006: ordered=0, arrived=129 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=129, demand=121, sold=121, ending on-hand inventory=8
Daily Profit: $484.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Observed pipeline=155, on-hand=8. Historical demand samples mean ~81.8 (samples: 140,45,30,95,99) and recent observed demand P4=121. Arrival log shows P2 order (129) arrived in P4 with lead_time=2; P1 order (155) has not concluded and is overdue. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed L=2). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline forecast while the system reconciles the missing P1 shipment. This balances service level (use observed lead time) against holding cost given current uncertainty about the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order 129 placed Period 2 arrived Period 4). Missing/lost shipment: P1 order 155 (placed Period 1) has not arrived by Period 4 conclude (expected by Period 3) and appears lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. History shows confirmed lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and a lost P1 shipment; on-hand=0, in-transit=268. Recent demand has risen sharply (last 3 periods: 53, 121, 145) so I forecast using the most recent regime to capture higher mean and volatility. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 2). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new higher-demand regime and increased variance, which raises the base-stock to improve service while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). On-hand=20, in-transit=276. History shows a clear demand regime shift: recent 3 concluded demands = {121,145,93} (mean \u2248119.7) vs earlier low-volume periods (21,29,53). Lead-time evidence: one confirmed L=2 (P2\u2192P4) and one short L=1 (P5\u2192P6); average observed = 1.5. Also note a likely lost shipment from Period 1 (ordered 155, never arrived). To capture the recent sustained uplift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (recent_N, N=3). For lead time I request the backend calculate average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). These choices bias orders upward to meet the higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability; using calculate for L lets the OR engine set review+lead appropriately despite one lost shipment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has been volatile with a spike in Periods 4-6 then a drop in P7. Observed concluded lead times: P4 showed order from P2 with lead_time=2; P6 showed order from P5 with lead_time=1. One earlier order (P1) appears lost. To balance service (avoid stockouts during recent high-demand spells) versus holding cost, I set L to the average of the two most recent observed lead times to reflect lead-time variability, and use recent-5 demand statistics to capture the recent regime (includes the spike). Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=214, in-transit=155. Historical observed lead times (from concluded arrivals): 2,1,2,1 \u2192 recent average ~1.5; promised=2 but variability exists and one lost shipment (P1) was previously identified. Recent demand (P4-P8 = 121,145,93,34,8) shows no sustained new regime (mean ~80). I set L using recent observed lead times to capture current variability; mu_hat using recent demand (last 5 periods) to reflect the most recent mix of high and low weeks; sigma_hat left as default so the OR engine uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (capture lead-time variability and recent demand spike) against holding cost given relatively high on-hand inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent observed lead times have alternated 1 and 2 periods (observed LT sequence last 4 = [2,1,2,1]) so I use a recent average to capture this variability. Recent demand has been volatile but lower after the March spike; I use the last 6 demand observations (Periods 4\u20139: 121,145,93,34,8,31) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast reflects the post-spike regime. On-hand (183) + in-transit (155) is currently large vs. recent demand, so using recent-window estimates avoids overreacting to the earlier high spike while still accounting for elevated variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 93,34,8,31,66) shows a lower recent mean than the full-history mean; on-hand=117 + in-transit=155 => pipeline=272 which already covers several periods. There is confirmed evidence of mixed lead-times but promised lead time is 2 and earlier carry-over noted a lost P1 shipment; therefore use default promised L to remain conservative. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5, periods 6-10) to adapt to the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk while preserving service. This balances profit-driven service level (profit/holding = 4) against holding cost given elevated on-hand+pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=98, in-transit=155. History shows actual lead time mostly 2 (one 1) and one lost P1 order; no new sustained lead-time shift in last concluded periods. Pipeline + on-hand (253) comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand; holding cost moderate vs profit (profit=$4, holding=$1) so target service balance favors using standard demand estimates. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its base-stock formula using all historical samples (conservative given mixed LT signals and a single lost shipment). This avoids overreacting to scattered late/lost arrivals while keeping safety stock from the default sigma estimate.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=88, in-transit=161. Historical concluded lead times: observed {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5) \u2014 lead times alternate 1\u20132 so use measured average. Recent demand has shifted from early large spikes to a steadier mid-range (recent demands: P8\u2013P12 = 8,31,66,19,10; earlier spike P5=145). To capture the most relevant demand regime I use a recent window. Choices: L by "calculate" to reflect observed mean lead time (1.5) rather than blindly trusting promised 2; mu_hat by "recent_N" (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the last 5 demand samples and adapt to recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat by "recent_N" (N=5) to estimate variability from the same recent window. These settings help the OR backend size base-stock to balance service (cover near-term demand given observed lead-time variability) vs holding cost by focusing on recent demand and measured lead-time rather than older spikes or a single promised lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=85, in-transit=161. Observed concluded lead times from history: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1 => recent average = 1.5. I choose L by averaging the 4 most recent observed lead times to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period realizations (recent_N N=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across review+lead using all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this balances service (uses observed L) versus holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise. This also leaves detection of further lead-time drift to future periods.

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} \u2192 recent average ~1.67; use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent regime (avg \u22481.67) to guard against intermittent 1-period arrivals. Use default demand and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine uses full-sample demand stats adjusted for chosen L. This balances service level (protecting against lead-time variability) vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been low (last several periods: 10,3,2,3 units) after earlier high spikes. On-hand=86, in-transit=155 (one large in-transit from earlier). Observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (multiple confirmations of 2, some 1); use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level with holding cost given current moderate on-hand + sizable pipeline and no new sustained demand regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent observed demand has fallen from early high weeks (140, 99, 145, etc.) to a low, stable regime in the last ~8 weeks (Periods 9-16 demands = 31,66,19,10,3,2,3,68; recent mean ~25). On-hand=18, in-transit=155 but carry-over shows a lost P1 shipment and lead time confirmed as 2; use conservative promised lead time. To avoid excess holding given the sustained lower demand, forecast using the recent demand regime: set L to default (promised), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the OR engine on the last N=8 periods (captures the lower mean and volatility), which reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service given observed demand pattern.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} (avg=1.6) with variability; choose L by 'calculate' (use average observed lead time). Recent demand has shifted down from early spikes to lower steady weekly sales \u2014 last 8 periods demand mean \u224824; use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture current regime. Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Note on-hand=0 and pipeline shows 155 (likely the previously flagged lost P1 shipment); choosing recent lead-time estimate and recent demand stats reduces risk of overordering while preserving service level.

Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 average \u22481.6; use calculated average lead time to let backend blend observed LT variance.

Demand history (early 2019 samples and periods 1\u201319) shows no sustained recent regime shift requiring an adjusted mean/volatility override. Use calculate for L so backend infers average observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals and prior lost shipment signal.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.6); use recent average to capture this. To keep the OR engine responsive to the recent lower demand regime while respecting lead-time uncertainty, set L by recent_N (N=5). For demand and volatility use recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent demand regime (reduces influence of the high early-March spikes). These choices balance service (accounting for >1-period lead time) against holding cost given a sizable in-transit position and overall lower recent demand.

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=215. Recent weekly demand has been low but intermittent spikes (e.g., Period 16 demand=68, Period 21 demand=28). Historical concluded lead times show both 1 and 2 periods; using calculated average better captures that variability. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 to weight the most recent 7 demand periods (captures the current low-demand regime while allowing for recent spikes). I use sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run std; these choices balance service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) versus holding cost by focusing on recent demand and observed lead-time behavior.

Recent demand is volatile with a large spike at Period 22 (104). I choose L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures mix of 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the most recent regime (captures the recent spike and current volatility) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit/holding=$4/$1.

Observed concluded lead times include mostly 2-periods with occasional 1; use calculated average lead time to let backend weight observed variability. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine applies historical demand base-stock; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding aggressive explicit increases given recent volatility.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a clear uptick in demand since Period 21 (demands: 28,104,111,100) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=216. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times fluctuating 1\u20132 periods but overall consistent with promised 2; there is also evidence of a lost P1 shipment recorded earlier. To capture the new high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4 covering Periods 21\u201324). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times from concluded messages (captures 1\u20132 period variability). These choices raise the review+lead demand estimate to meet the recent surge while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility; this balances higher service needs against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent elevated demand rather than the long-run low mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21: avg demand for Periods 21\u201324 = 85.75 vs prior Periods 15\u201320 avg \u2248 16.67 (+414%), sustained for 4 periods

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 21: Periods 21\u201325 demands = [28,104,111,100,91] (avg \u2248 86). Pipeline shows 314 in-transit, on-hand 0; earlier shipments include one confirmed lost (P1) and mixed lead-times. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures observed 1\u20132 period variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the new high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201325). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect volatility in this recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting OR compute safety stock from observed lead-time behavior.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 21 (high demand sustained through Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average of observed lead times \u22481.6, so use calculated average lead time. For demand I use recent_N=6 (Periods 21\u201326) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing mu_hat and sigma_hat; this keeps service high while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand data. Using recent volatility for sigma_hat aligns safety stock with the new regime. These choices let the OR backend size replenishment to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the elevated demand while preventing excessive long-term holding given the large pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime (Periods 21\u201327) is elevated (avg \u224886/week) vs prior low-demand regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=225 (covers expected demand). Several concluded arrivals show lead_time\u22482 most recently. I use L=default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals consistently support the promised lead time and the OR engine expects promised L. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201327) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=7 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the sustained demand spike while letting the OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand regime (Periods 21\u201328) is elevated and sustained (many weeks ~85\u2013123). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (ample pipeline but arrivals unobserved until conclude). Lead time historically confirmed as 2 (carry-over evidence). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 2. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (periods 21\u201328) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 8 samples; this biases orders toward the new higher demand while letting OR backend apply service-level cap given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent sustained demand regime since Period 21 (avg \u224897/week) \u2014 use recent data to reflect higher baseline. Observed lead times vary (1\u20132), average ~1.67; use calculated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (sufficient buffer vs. forecast but kept in mind for ordering cap). Chosen L method = calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat recent_N with N=9 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201329 mean \u224897); sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to capture current volatility (~27.7). These settings bias base-stock toward the higher recent demand while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 21 (Periods 21\u201330 high demand) and variable observed lead times (observed leads: 2,1,2,1,2,2,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.875). Current inventory: on-hand=45, in-transit=216. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability, including a 3-period event). For demand, I use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201330) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent elevated samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices concentrate stock for the sustained higher-demand regime while modeling observed lead-time variability to avoid underordering given delayed arrivals and prior lost shipment patterns.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133), most commonly 2; last 5 observed lead times average ~2.2 so I use recent_N=5 to capture recent variability. Demand shifted up starting Period 21 (sustained high-demand regime through Period 31); use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the post-change regime (Periods 21\u201331). This raises target base stock to avoid stockouts given elevated demand while keeping sigma from older low-demand periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23. On-hand=10, in-transit=254. Historical concluded lead times are variable (1\u20133 periods) but recent arrivals (Periods 30\u201332) average ~2, and demand sharply increased starting Period 21 and has persisted. To capture the recent lead-time behavior I use recent_N with N=3 (reflecting the most recent lead-time samples averaging \u22482). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (the sustained high-demand regime from Period 21\u201332) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead window. These choices prioritize service during this sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by basing estimates on the observed recent regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=299. Historical concluded lead times (observed) = [2,1,2,1,2,2,3,2,1] \u2192 avg\u22481.78; lead times have varied around 2 with occasional 1\u20133 realizations and one confirmed lost shipment earlier. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 21 (sustained high demand); recent periods remain in the higher-demand regime. I set L using a recent_N average of all 9 observed lead times to capture current variability (recent behavior around 2). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201333, 13 samples) so the base stock reflects the sustained higher demand. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline and higher demand) against holding cost by calibrating forecast and variability to the high-demand regime rather than diluting with older low-demand data.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=56, in-transit=250 (total pipeline 306). Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133) so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand regime ramped up starting Period 21 and remains elevated/volatile; to capture recent higher demand I use a recent_N mu_hat (N=10) to bias forecast toward the latest regime while retaining some smoothing. Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from full history. These choices aim to raise base stock for higher recent demand while letting OR cap limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been in the higher regime that started Period 21 (sustained elevated weekly demand). On-hand=53, in-transit=250 (healthy pipeline) but lead times have varied historically (1\u20133 weeks). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20133 period variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (regime from Period 21\u201337 length=17) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the pipeline level reduces risk of stockouts and avoids excessive holding given holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=50, in-transit=250. Historical concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,3,3} \u2192 average = 2.0, so use calculate for L to reflect observed mean. Demand regime: confirmed spike starting Period 21 (Periods 21\u201324 avg=85.75) but more recent weeks show high variability and a downward drift in the last ~10 periods. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand level and volatility while smoothing older regime shifts. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent decline without overreacting to single low weeks. No new confirmed lost-shipment patterns since prior insights.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 21 (sustained higher weekly demand); current on-hand=57 + in-transit=240 => pipeline 297. Observed concluded lead times vary and recent arrivals skew longer (several 3-period arrivals). I set L via recent_N to emphasize recent longer lead-times (N=6 captures last 6 observed lead times, avg \u22482.5). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=19 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 21\u201339 (regime length=19), so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std will reflect the new demand level and its volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover the longer recent lead time and the sustained demand spike while the OR backend will convert them to a capped base-stock tradeoff between service and holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained rise in observed lead times (multiple 3-period arrivals) and a prior demand regime shift (Periods 21\u201324). Current inventory: on-hand=37, in-transit=240 (large pipeline \u2014 no immediate need to inflate demand forecast). I set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent uptick in realized lead time (so the OR engine will size orders for the longer effective pipeline). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full-sample demand moments scaled by (1+L) to avoid overreacting to short-term noise given the large in-transit stock. This balances service (accounting for longer lead times) against holding cost (large current pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P27 arrived P30 (LT=3); P32 arrived P35 (LT=3); P33 arrived P36 (LT=3); P36 arrived P39 (LT=3)).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=240. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Demand regime shifted starting Period 21 (sustained high weekly demand thereafter). To capture the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3 so the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (max sensible recent window capped at 20) so forecasts reflect the post-Period-21 higher mean and variance and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical conclude messages (Periods 30,35,36,39) and carry-over confirm actual lead time shifted to 3 periods. Recent demand is highly volatile with a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 21 and very large demands in the last 4 periods (Periods 39\u201342 = 3,20,135,308). To prioritize service and avoid stockouts given long LT and recent surge, set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the most recent short regime (last N=4 periods) so mu_hat captures the current spike; use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to protect against stockouts while reflecting higher short-term variability; in-transit (369) will be netted by OR engine.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been volatile and elevated (recent 5-period avg demand \u2248110.6 units/week), and concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P27-P36 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=703 (large pipeline). To protect service during sustained high demand and longer observed lead time I set L explicit=3. I set mu_hat explicit to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean = 4\xd7110.6 = 442.4 to align base-stock with current high-demand regime. I set sigma_hat explicit=219.0 (\u22482\xd7recent-period std adjusted for review+lead) to reflect elevated demand volatility; these choices bias the OR engine to maintain higher on-hand to avoid stockouts given observed LT=3 and recent demand spikes while recognizing holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-12-16. History shows confirmed longer lead time (multiple arrivals with LT=3) and recent demand surge (large demands in Periods 41\u201344). To protect service given observed LT=3 and recent high/volatile demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (Periods 39\u201344) so the OR backend raises target inventory for higher demand while reflecting recent variability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmations P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 21; most recent 4 concluded demands (P42\u2013P45) = [308, 87, 83, 115], indicating elevated short-term demand. Current on-hand 348 + in-transit 240 provides coverage, but with LT\u22483 we must plan for (1+L) review+lead horizon = 4 periods. I set L using recent observed lead times to reflect the LT=3 regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 demand samples to capture the current elevated demand and volatility, so the OR backend will size base stock to meet higher short-run demand while accounting for observed LT and limiting excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=316, in-transit=254. Recent history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Demand has been volatile with recent spikes (Nov\u2013Dec). To reflect recent lead-time regime I average the most recent observed lead times (recent_N, N=4). For demand I use the last 5 demand samples to capture the current high-volatility regime (recent_N, N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and safety stock to meet elevated recent demand while controlling holding costs given substantial on-hand inventory.
