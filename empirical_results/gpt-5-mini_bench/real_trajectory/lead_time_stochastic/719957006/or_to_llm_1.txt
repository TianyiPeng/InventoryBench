OR recommended 0 because its base-stock minus pipeline is \u22640. Risk check: historical lost-shipment evidence is limited to early Period1; no recent multi-period missing concludes, so do not assume loss. Holding cost vs profit: profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate service bias but pipeline already covers ~3 periods. Decision: place 0 units \u2014 rely on the 435 in-transit to meet the short-term elevated demand and avoid unnecessary holding cost.
