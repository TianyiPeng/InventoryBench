Historical weekly demand (Jan\u2013early Feb) ranged 21\u201353 with recent samples: 46,33,53,37,21. Current period demand observed = 47, indicating a Valentine-related spike this week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and supplier promised lead time=2 periods, so any order placed now will arrive in Period 3 and cannot satisfy this current (Valentine) demand. Forecast: post-Valentine weekly demand likely reverts toward historical mean ~38/week; to be conservative we target ~35\u201336 units/week. With lead time L=2 we should cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand in pipeline -> target inventory arrival \u2248 3\xd736 \u2248 108 units. Holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), so slight overstock is acceptable to avoid lost sales. No evidence of lead-time deviation or sustained regime change yet.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas) \u2014 necklaces are gift items and can spike around this date. Demand history: recent weeks show P43=10, P44=12, P45=73 (single large spike). Historical regime changes require 3+ periods to confirm; we have only one holiday-week spike so far. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised L=2 but observed arrivals vary 1\u20133 periods and some lost orders historically; currently In-transit=298 units (large pipeline). Inventory policy: with L=2, decision must cover current + next 2 periods demand; given large in-transit quantity (298) and uncertain arrival timing but substantial, placing new orders risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) and potential lost shipments. Trade-off: profit per unit is high ($19) but holding cost and existing pipeline dominate risk. Action: place no new order this period to avoid overstocking; monitor concl messages next periods to update lead-time/arrival evidence and react if pipeline arrivals fail to materialize.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday). Recent spikes in Periods 45-46 (73,70) likely holiday-driven but only two high weeks so not yet a sustained regime change. Demand history: prior steady low weeks in Nov\u2013early Dec (~10\u201316) then two-week spike (~70). Use conservative forecast of ~70 units/week short-term given recent evidence and holiday timing. Lead time & shipments: historical concluded arrivals show predominant lead_time \u22482 periods with occasional 1\u20133 period arrivals and some lost shipments; in-transit=298 likely includes outstanding shipments (no new conclude indicating loss). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=298 which covers (L+1)=3 weeks demand at forecast 70/week (required \u2248210). Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit $19/unit, so excess inventory is costly to hold. Final action: do not place new order this period because pipeline already sufficiently covers near-term demand and ordering risks extra holding cost.",
