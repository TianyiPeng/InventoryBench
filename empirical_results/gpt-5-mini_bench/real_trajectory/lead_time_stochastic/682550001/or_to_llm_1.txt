Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observation & lead-time inference: Concluded history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20132 periods) and two earlier lost orders (Periods 1 and 10) already recorded in carry-over. No new concluded arrivals indicate a systematic lead-time change. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 288. Recent demand regime (Periods 32\u201346) average \u2248 69 units/week; (L+1)=3 \u2192 expected demand over review+lead \u2248 69\xd73 \u2248 208 units. OR recommended 0 because it uses promised L and historical data; pipeline_inventory (288) already exceeds the needed ~208, giving ~80-unit buffer. Risk assessment: Past lost shipments exist but no recent evidence of additional lost shipments or prolonged nondelivery for the current in-transit volume. With profit=holding cost, over-ordering is costly. Decision: Do not order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost since in-transit comfortably covers (L+1) periods of expected demand and OR's cap is respected.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order\u2014in-transit 288 units exceeds expected (L+1) demand \u2248208 (3\xd7~69), so pipeline already covers the lead-time demand and ordering would raise holding cost.",
