  "rationale": "Lead-time: use only concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Recent concluded history shows no new late arrivals; several past orders were lost/delayed (notably Period1 lost). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=303. Demand: carry-over insights already document a sustained multistep downshift; recent weekly demand (Periods 43\u201346) remains very low (3,4,6,6). Profit/holding: profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8 (z\u22480.84) so OR would hold safety stock, but OR recommended 0 because pipeline + on-hand already exceed its base-stock. Risk: some in-transit units can be lost, but 303 units in-transit is large relative to current low demand (~<20/week). Policy: do not order now. Rationale: ordering would risk extra holding cost while in-transit pipeline already covers the (L+1)-period demand even under moderate uncertainty; demand regime is depressed and sustained per carry-over insights, so follow conservative posture and place 0 units.",
