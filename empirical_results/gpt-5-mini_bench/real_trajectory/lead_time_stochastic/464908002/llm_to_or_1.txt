Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 464908002: underwear low-season post-Jan samples (5 weeks mean=58.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised L=2 and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time change or demand shift. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to avoid overreacting to limited data while covering (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (5 weekly points from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show no sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=87 (order placed Period 1) \u2014 arrival by promised L=2 implies it should arrive during Period 3, so no late-shipment evidence yet. Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full sample mean) against holding cost given limited evidence of demand shift or lead-time disruption.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples mean=58.4 (samples: 83,59,64,50,36). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence to change lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=173 vs (1+L)*mean \u22483*58.4=175.2 (pipeline ~2.2 units short). Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps parameters anchored to historical baseline while acknowledging slight shortfall in pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (Jan 2019) average ~58.4/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=183 equals sum of orders (87+86+10). Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for the P1-P3 orders \u2014 a sign of delayed or lost shipments, but this is a single multi-period miss and NOT yet 3+ consecutive confirmed periods, so it's insufficient to conclusively change lead-time or demand regime. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)*mean forecast and sqrt(1+L)*std uncertainty. This balances service level while avoiding overreacting to a possibly transient shipping delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent on-hand=46, in-transit=97. Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean=58.4, but the last 4 decision-period demands (P1\u2013P4) average 38.5, a sustained lower-demand regime for 4 periods. One concluded arrival shows actual lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4), matching promised L=2. I therefore keep L at default (promised 2). To adapt to the recent lower demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the most recent 4 demand observations: 32,40,42,40). This reduces target base-stock and holding risk while preserving service given observed lead time and demand decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected (2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04): historical mean 58.4 vs recent 4-period mean 38.5 (\u221234%), sustained for 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has fallen vs historical (recent 4-period mean ~38.5 vs historical ~58.4 per provided insight). On-hand=22 + in-transit=97 -> ample pipeline but one earlier order (Period1) appears missing while Period2 confirmed with lead_time=2. Use calculated L (average observed lead times = 2) to reflect confirmed evidence; tighten mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to capture the sustained ~34% drop in demand and reduce overstock risk given holding cost >0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=100. Historical weekly mean=58.4 (Jan samples) but recent weeks show a sustained drop; recent 4-week demand is lower. One concluded arrival shows actual lead time=2 (order on P2 arrived P4). To be responsive to the recent lower demand while respecting observed lead time, set L to calculated average of observed lead times, and use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend reduces target base-stock to match the new regime and avoid excess holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has stepped down vs historical: last 4 concluded demands = [40,24,33,38] (4-period mean 33.75 vs historical mean 58.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=117; arrivals have been unreliable (multiple ordered batches never concluded), but one concluded lead time = 2 periods (Period2\u2192Period4). I therefore: set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (avg observed = 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the sustained lower regime (regime length=4), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering from legacy higher mean while retaining coverage over the review+lead horizon and accounting for observed lead time; they balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=97. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: arrivals in Period 4 (order P2) had LT=2; Period 8 had arrivals from P6 (LT=2) and P7 (LT=1) => observed LT samples = {2,2,1}, avg\u22481.67. Recent demand has shifted down vs historical (sustained drop across recent weeks). To reflect the observed LT variability I let the backend compute average observed LT (calculate). To respect the confirmed recent demand regime shift, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (last 4 demand periods) so forecasts reflect the lower recent mean and variance; this reduces over-ordering given substantial in-transit stock (97) and holding cost. These choices balance service (accounting for slightly >1.5 observed LT) and holding cost by basing demand on the recent lower regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=117. Recent demand (Periods 5-9) shows elevated weekly demand (24,33,38,44,49) vs the earlier downshift detected at Period 5; latest 5-week window suggests demand recovery. Observed concluded lead times: orders arriving give lead times [2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8)] \u2014 average ~1.67. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical average lead time (calculate) to reflect mixed evidence. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest regime (recovering demand) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 samples). I keep sigma_hat at default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) because volatility estimate is stable and backend uses full-history std for risk sizing. These choices balance service (raise target to meet recent higher demand) while keeping uncertainty handled by default sigma.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=115. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times: observed W = [2,2,1,1] (avg 1.5) indicating actual LT shorter than promised but variable. Recent demand shows a rising short-run mean (last 4 demands = 38,44,49,53) so I use recent_N to capture latest regime. Choose L by averaging last 4 observed lead times to reflect shorter/variable LT; choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 4 demand samples (captures current uptick and recent volatility). This keeps target base-stock responsive to faster arrivals and higher recent demand, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Recent demand has risen vs the earlier low-regime, but the rise is not yet a multi-period stable shift relative to the full historical sample. To be conservative: infer lead time from observed conclues (calculate average), and use default demand statistics (backend (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine leverages full historical sample while accounting for inferred L. This balances service level (use observed lead time) and holding cost (do not overreact to short-run spikes).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand regime since Period 5 is lower (recent 4\u2010period mean ~38.5 vs historical mean ~58.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=162 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; use backend-calculated average to let OR engine infer effective LT. Set L=calculate to average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower regime (1+L multiplied internally by backend). Use sigma recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to the confirmed lower-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders using its cap formula and the observed pipeline, reducing overstock risk given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=171 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have been inconsistent (observed lead times vary 1\u20132 periods). Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand has shown recent uptick (last 4 demands: 53, 60, 81, 43) so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 4 samples to capture the current regime. These choices balance service (capturing recent higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=188. Observed concluded lead times: {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1, P9->P10:1, P11->P13:2, P12->P14:2} (recent average ~1.67). Recent demand has risen vs earlier dip; last 4 concluded demands = [60,81,43,55], mean=59.75. To balance service and holding cost: set L to recent average to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals (recent_N N=6). Use recent 4 periods for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent uptick and variability rather than older lower-demand regime. This keeps base stock responsive to current higher demand while limiting excess inventory given significant in-transit stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

No new sustained demand regime change since prior insight. I choose L="calculate" to let backend use the average observed lead time; mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages the full history while the calculated L accounts for observed 1\u20132 period lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate order urgency.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 5 (mean fell ~34%) and multiple observed lead times (mostly 2, some 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=203 (sufficient pipeline coverage). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations). For demand I use recent_N to reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime and reduce forecast bias from older higher-demand samples; regime length \u2248 12 most recent periods, so N=12. I use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while the large in-transit quantity prevents stockouts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=188 (multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times mostly 2 with occasional 1; recent arrivals P15->P17, P12->P14, P11->P13 confirm frequent 2-period lead). Demand history shows recent higher demand with a large spike (last 5 period demands: 43,55,52,54,106) \u2014 I use a short recent window to capture current regime. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures the recent spike while smoothing slightly). This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and substantial in-transit) against holding cost by using recent estimates rather than long-run averages.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed but predominantly 2-period lead times; last 5 observed lead times average ~1.6 so I use recent_N=5. Demand has jumped in the last 4 periods (demands 52,54,106,139) \u2014 this is a new high-volatility regime, so I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the immediate demand level and variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=223 provides pipeline cover but recent high demand implies higher short-term forecast; these choices raise target base_stock to prioritize service while sigma_hat captures volatility to limit excessive holding.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=290 (sizable pipeline). Recent demand has jumped sharply in mid-June (Periods 16-19). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; average lead time estimated from observed history. To capture the recent demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 4 periods (Periods 16\u201319) so the OR backend targets stock for the current high-demand regime while L is estimated from all concluded lead times. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: recent avg (Periods 16-19) = 95.8 vs historical mean 58.4 (+64%), sustained for 4 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=340 (large pipeline but arrivals not yet concluded). Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1] => avg=1.625, so use calculate to capture realized variability vs promised=2. Recent demand regime (Periods 17-20) is elevated: demands = [106,139,84,98], recent mean \u2248106.75; use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to size (1+L)-period demand reflecting this sustained spike. Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect higher recent volatility. These settings help the OR backend increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts from the persistent high-demand regime while using observed lead time to avoid over-ordering given pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 17-21) elevated (\u2248107.8/week) vs historical mean 58.4 \u2014 carry-over insight from earlier periods confirmed a sustained regime shift around Period 16. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but recent arrivals imply average \u22481.6 periods. I set L via recent_N to capture current supplier behavior (use last 5 observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime (use last 5 demand observations: Periods 17-21). These choices increase target base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline and higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility so the backend can size safety stock appropriately.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has risen substantially: last 4 concluded demands (P19-P22) = 84, 98, 112, 114 (avg 102). On-hand=0, in-transit=305 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average observed lead time \u22481.67. To respond to the confirmed higher-demand regime (sustained ~4 periods) I set L to be inferred from observed history (calculate). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the elevated recent mean over the review+lead period. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock target on the new higher-demand regime while relying on the pipeline (305 units) to cover much of the short-term need, avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has risen and stabilized (Periods 20-23 demands = 98,112,114,107; recent mean \u2248107.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 \u2014 this roughly matches coverage for \u2248(1+L) periods at recent demand. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132), so I let backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I use the most recent 4 weeks (recent_N N=4) to capture the confirmed high-demand regime; same 4-week window for volatility (sigma) to reflect recent variability. These choices make mu_hat target the elevated recent demand and let the OR engine size orders so pipeline+on-hand covers the (1+L) review+lead horizon while capping exposure via the backend cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has been elevated since Period 16 (multiple weeks of 80\u2013140 units) vs earlier historical mean ~58. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude history) = {2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,2} \u2192 avg ~1.7. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 9 demand samples (Periods 16\u201324) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean; I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. For lead time I select calculate to let backend average observed lead times (closer to 1.7 vs promised 2), which helps avoid over-ordering given a slightly shorter realized lead time. This balances service (by sizing to the higher recent mean) against holding cost (by using the shorter averaged L and recent volatility).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 16 (avg \u224895.8) vs historical mean 58.4. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=334 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times in history are mostly 2 with occasional 1; recent sequence (most recent 6 observed lead times) averages ~1.83 \u2192 choose recent_N for L to reflect near-2 lead time while allowing shorter arrivals. For demand forecast, use recent_N over the last 10 periods (Periods 16-25) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma over same 10 periods to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base-stock sized for the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit position prevents over-ordering; recent_N lead time avoids underestimating arrival delays and reduces stockouts without excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical weekly mean = 58.4 (samples provided). Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 16 (carry-over notes: recent avg \u224895.8). Lead times observed historically vary (1\u20133); no sustained shift to a new lead time confirmed (single recent 3-period arrival only). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (robust to occasional 1\u20133 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the higher-demand regime since Period 16 ((1+L) multiplier applied by backend). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=11 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices raise target base stock to serve the elevated demand while using observed lead-time average to avoid over-committing when occasional long shipments appear.

Lead times observed in concluded history vary; use overall observed average to let backend reconcile promised vs observed delays. I choose L=calculate to reflect average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (covers review+lead demand). This raises target base-stock to improve service (reducing lost sales) while sigma_hat from recent volatility controls safety-stock to limit excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=323. Recent concluded lead times have varied (last observed lead_time=3) so I use a recent average to capture variability. Demand has been elevated vs early 2019; last 8 weeks (Periods 21-28) avg demand \u224886.4 which better reflects current regime than the long-run mean. Choices: set L as recent_N (N=5) to average the most recent lead-time observations, set mu_hat as recent_N (N=8) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand across the review+lead period, and set sigma_hat as recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. These params increase cover for higher recent demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid under/over-ordering given delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=323 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations (most recent arrivals): [.., Period22:2, Period23:2, Period26:3] \u2014 small uptick to 3 observed at P26. I choose L by averaging the most recent 5 observed lead times to capture this recent drift without over-weighting older data. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period16; recent weekly demands (most recent 5) are representative of the current regime, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current demand pattern. These parameters balance service (capture recent higher demand and slight lead-time increase) while the large in-transit stock will limit order sizes computed by the backend cap.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent demand (Periods 26-30) ~61 avg, pipeline high (312 in-transit) and on-hand 0. Recent concludes show some arrivals with lead_time=3 (orders P23->P26, P27->P30) suggesting upward lead-time risk; however evidence <3 periods so be cautious. Set L explicit=3 to protect against observed longer deliveries. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable ~60 demand regime in the last five periods and avoid overweighting older seasonal spikes. This keeps base-stock sized to cover (1+L) periods of the current regime while sigma based on recent volatility limits over-ordering given large pipeline.

Recent demand has moved through multiple regimes; I target the most recent behavior by using a recent_N forecast over the last 12 demand observations to reflect current weekly demand level while letting backend scale by (1+L). Sigma left as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample history given mixed past regimes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1,2,3 periods across history, including recent 3-period arrivals), so I estimate L from observed history rather than trusting promised. I select L='calculate' to average all observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine will scale safety stock appropriately given the inferred L; this conservatively leverages the large in-transit pipeline while accounting for variable actual lead time.

Recent concluded arrivals show lead times recently at 3 periods (arrivals in P26 and P30) but earlier values were 1-2; to be robust I set L using a short recent average of observed lead times. Demand has shifted historically (earlier carry-over insights) so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent weeks to capture current regime (last 4 demand observations). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent demand level while accounting for the slightly longer observed lead time and avoiding overreaction given large in-transit stock.

Historical concluded lead times (observed) = {1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,1,1} average \u22481.92 \u2192 use calculated lead time to reflect realized LT ~2. Recent demand (Periods 31-34) = [43,38,56,42], recent mean \u224844.75 which is below long-run mean (58.4) and reflects the current lower-demand regime; use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture current demand level across review+lead. Demand volatility also appears lower recently; use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to match recent variance. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to cover current short-term demand while acknowledging observed lead-time behavior and avoiding excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, In-transit=312 \u2014 large pipeline stock likely covers multiple weeks. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed lead times = {2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,3,3}, avg \u22481.92). No new sustained demand regime shift in recent weeks (last 4 weeks demand ~38\u201356). I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized variability rather than blind promised=2. For demand and volatility I keep defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); with large in-transit position this avoids over-ordering while letting the OR backend compute base stock and cap. This balances service (using observed lead time) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline arriving in future). Recent weekly demand (last 4 concluded periods) = [43,38,56,42,52,36] \u2014 last 4-week average ~46; earlier carry-over notes record past regime shifts so use short recent window to capture current moderate demand. Use promised lead time (default) because actual lead times have varied but pipeline is large and no new sustained lead-time change is confirmed. Set mu_hat with recent_N (N=4) to target (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime; keep sigma_hat default to let backend use full-sample volatility. This balances service (use recent demand to avoid stockouts when pipeline depletes) vs holding cost (large pipeline warns against inflating forecasts).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand (last 8 weeks) is moderate ~40\u201360 units/week after earlier spikes; on-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133 periods) with recent arrivals showing longer delays (two 3-period observations). To be responsive to recent lead-time drift I set L using recent lead-time observations. For demand I use recent 8-week samples to capture the current lower/steady regime (avoiding older high-spike periods). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to recent demand and longer effective lead time while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgency to overshoot orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent demand (Periods 31-38) shows lower sustained demand vs earlier spikes (recent 8-period mean ~45.8). Historical actual lead times have varied (1\u20133); recent arrivals suggest occasional 3-period delays. To reflect recent patterns I set L using recent observed lead times and forecast demand/volatility from the last 8 weeks to be responsive to the current lower-demand regime while accounting for occasional longer deliveries. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of recent demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed W in concluded arrivals: 1\u20133, average ~1.75) with several 2\u20133 period deliveries recently; no new arrivals in Period 39 conclude. To capture the observed variability I set L to calculate (use average of observed lead times). Demand forecasting uses default (all-sample mean scaled by (1+L)) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap with the inferred L and full-sample statistics. This balances service (capture longer observed lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit volume (312 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); avg of observed lead times ~1.75 so use calculated average to better reflect reality vs promised=2. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201340) shows a lower regime (~36 wkly avg) versus earlier high spikes; to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit stock, use a recent_N demand estimate (last 10 weeks) so mu_hat reflects the recent lower demand. Keep sigma_hat default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to give the OR engine a conservative volatility estimate. These choices reduce risk of excess holding given 312 units already in transit while modestly improving service by acknowledging slightly shorter actual lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last weeks) has been lower (~25\u201348) versus earlier spikes; to capture the recent regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the last 5 samples to focus the forecast on current lower-demand behavior. These parameters bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Historical concluded lead times (most recent: 2,2,3,3,1) show upward drift vs promised 2; I use recent lead-time average to reflect recent variability. Recent demand has been low in late Nov (Periods 39-42: 29,25,25,38); to avoid excess holding over the holiday window while preserving service vs pipeline uncertainty, I set demand forecast using the most recent 4 weeks and match volatility to those 4 weeks.

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); most recent observed lead times (Periods 23,26,30) average ~2.67 \u2192 use recent_N to capture recent delivery behavior. Demand has shifted to a lower, stable regime over the last several weeks, so use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility and keep inventory lean given holding cost >0. Methods chosen: L recent_N (N=3) to estimate current effective lead time; mu_hat recent_N (N=8) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to base forecast and uncertainty on the most recent low-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the OR engine.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concluded lead times observed = {1,2,3} with average \u22481.92 based on concluded arrivals; recent history shows variability and occasional 3-period delays. I choose L=calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. Demand forecast and uncertainty use default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples respectively; this leverages full historical sample set (stable multi-period regime shifts already recorded) and lets the OR engine compute base stock and cap using its profit/holding parameters. This balances service level (using observed lead time average) against holding cost without overreacting to short recent fluctuations or potentially lost shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 312 \u2014 large pipeline currently covers multiple weeks of expected demand. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed = 1\u20133, avg \u22482). Recent demand has been low since late Oct/Dec (no new sustained changepoint beyond previously recorded insights). To reflect observed variability in lead time I use calculate for L (avg of observed concluded lead times \u22482). Given the sizable in-transit stock and no new confirmed demand regime, use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids over-ordering while letting the backend cap orders using its cap formula and the large existing pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent demand (last 4 weeks: Periods 43-46) is low (10,15,36,29 \u2192 avg 22.5) after earlier mid-year spikes. Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,3,3], average \u22481.92 \u2192 use calculate to reflect observed mean lead time. To capture the current low-december demand regime I use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 4 weeks to avoid bias from mid-year spikes). This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost by sizing forecast to recent low demand rather than historical highs.
