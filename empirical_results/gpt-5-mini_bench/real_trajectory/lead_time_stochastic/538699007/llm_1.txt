Product is a women's V-neck strap top (light apparel) \u2014 modestly seasonal toward warmer months but can sell in indoor climates year-round. No explicit holiday-driven surge expected for this basic garment, though mid-Feb promotions could slightly boost demand. b) Demand analysis: historical weekly samples provided: 2019-01-07:46, 2019-01-14:56, 2019-01-21:43, 2019-01-28:44, 2019-02-04:76. Mean of these five = 53 units/week. Current period observation (Period 1) demand = 47, consistent with the recent mean range. c) Lead time & orders: Promised lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time yet. d) Inventory & pipeline: With lead time likely >=2, an order now must cover (L+1)=3 periods (current + 2 future periods) of expected demand because arrivals will occur during Period N+2 after decision and only be visible later. e) Order logic: Use recent mean demand = 53 units/week. Target coverage = 3 * 53 = 159 units. With zero on-hand and zero in-transit, place an order for 159 units to cover expected demand over the decision-relevant horizon while avoiding excessive multi-period overstock given high holding cost.",

Period 1 (2019-02-11) showed a large spike to 135 units\u2014one strong period but not yet evidence of a sustained regime change.

Order of 159 placed in P1 shows arrived=0 in P1 conclude and is in-transit=159 now; no conclude yet that it arrived, consistent with LT>=1. No concluded arrivals observed to contradict promised LT; no shipments confirmed lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=159.

In-transit 159 covers most of that, so place a small top-up order = 180-159 = 21 units to reach target coverage while avoiding excess holding (holding cost = profit).
