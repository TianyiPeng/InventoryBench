Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (5): 46,56,43,44,76 \u2014 no sustained regime shift (only one high week). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals to infer otherwise. Profit= $1, Holding=$1 \u2192 service quantile q=0.5 so z*=0, meaning base-stock equals forecast \u03bc\u0302. Use default statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap; this balances service level and holding cost given limited evidence of change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly mean demand = 53 (samples: 46,56,43,44,76). Period 1 showed a one-off spike (demand=135) but this is only a single high observation so not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=76 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals to infer a different actual lead time. I choose default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level using the long-run samples while avoiding overreacting to a single large demand spike; it also leaves the OR capped ordering rule to limit order size given pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded periods show orders placed in P1 and P2 have not arrived yet (arrived=0), and in-transit=200 units. Historical weekly mean demand \u224853 (samples: 46,56,43,44,76). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals yet to confirm a lead-time change (insufficient evidence to declare lost shipments or longer lead time). Using default lead time keeps backend aligned with contract; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat uses all samples ((1+L)*mean \u2248 3*53=159) and conservatively captures variability. With in-transit=200 > default mu_hat (\u2248159), no additional aggressive replenishment is required now\u2014this balances service level vs. holding cost while we wait for concluded arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent historical weekly demand samples: [46,56,43,44,76] (mean=53). On-hand=0, in-transit=236 (matches orders placed P1-P3: 76+124+36). Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for orders placed earlier; P1's order (Period1) should have concluded by now if actual lead time=promised 2, but it did not\u2014this is a single missing arrival signal (not yet sustained). Given only one missed conclusion, be conservative and keep promised lead time. Use default demand/variance aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost under standard assumptions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent conclude shows Period 2 order (124) arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2, matching promised L=2. On-hand 33 + in-transit 123 = 156 units; historical weekly mean = 53 (5 samples), so (1+L)*mean \u2248 159 \u2014 pipeline is slightly short of 3 weeks coverage. I set L by calculation (use observed lead times). I use default demand/std methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weeks show moderate weekly demand (historical samples mean=53). Carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=217 (covers upcoming demand under L=2). I set L to default (promised lead time = 2) consistent with observed confirmation. I choose mu_hat default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures full-scope forecast given limited history). I choose sigma_hat default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, reflecting observed variability. These settings balance service (avoid stockouts given 217 in transit and 3-period coverage) against holding cost equal to profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand 0, in-transit 152. Concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent realized demand history (Periods 1-6: 135,149,108,91,72,124) is more representative than the older 2019 samples, so use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility over the last 6 periods and scale by (1+L) internally. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and the uncertain mixed lead-time signal.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent weekly demand samples (historical mean \u224853/week) and volatile demand: recent concluded demands show 91,72,124,169 indicating higher recent demand but short sample. On-hand=0, in-transit=313 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrival timing has been inconsistent (observed lead_times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1). I select L.method="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed evidence without overreacting). For demand forecast I use mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples, balancing service-level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit volume and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has jumped vs. Jan baseline; on-hand=0, in-transit=123. Observed lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand forecast uses the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 4-8) to capture the new, higher regime. Volatility likewise estimated from the same 5 most recent samples. These choices ensure the base-stock reflects the sustained demand increase while letting the backend compute L from observed arrivals and scale safety stock to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from historical Jan mean 53 units/week to recent 5-period average 136.6 units/week (Periods 4-8: avg=136.6, previous sample avg=53; +158%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent demand has jumped (Periods 4-8 avg \u2248136.6 vs historical Jan mean 53) and this higher regime persisted 5 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (large pipeline but arrivals are delayed/unconfirmed for recent order). Observed lead times = {2,1,2,1} so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the sustained demand increase I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (uses the most recent 5 demand samples to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean). Volatility has clearly changed with the regime shift, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the new higher-demand regime while using recent variance to keep safety stock appropriate given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 4-8 avg ~136.6) and variable arrivals with observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods. Current on-hand=104, in-transit=213 (pipeline=317) which covers several weeks of elevated demand but some shipments have arrived faster than promised. I set L=calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor mu_hat to the recent high-demand regime (last 5 demand samples), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward serving the confirmed higher demand while letting the backend compute safety stock using the inferred lead time and recent demand variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=388. Recent demand has been elevated (Periods 7-11: 169,227,163,136,136). Observed lead times in concluded history = [2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.4. To capture the recent high-demand regime while letting backend compute lead-time, I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent sustained regime (last 5 periods). This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock will track mu_hat. The large in-transit (388) likely covers near-term demand but may include late/lost arrivals; using recent_N keeps orders responsive to actual recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further increased: Periods 7-11 average = 166.2 units/week (169,227,163,136,136), up from prior recent avg 136.6 (+21.6, +15.8%), sustained over 5 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has risen and stabilized above historical Jan mean: last 5 demand observations (P8-P12) = [227,163,136,136,131], recent avg \u2248158.6/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=499 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the newer, higher-demand regime and its volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the recent elevated demand while recognizing substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (Periods 7-11 avg=166.2/week) vs historical Jan mean ~53. Observed lead times from concluded messages = [2,1,2,1,1,2] \u2192 average 1.5. On-hand=78, in-transit=324 (ample pipeline). To reflect sustained higher demand while letting backend use observed lead-time history, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime (N=5 corresponds to the 5-period sustained shift), letting OR compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across those last 5 samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=76, in-transit=213. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 repeatedly; pipeline (213) plus on-hand (76) provides coverage but demand has softened from the prior peak: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14) = [136,136,131,97,113], recent 5-period avg = 122.6/wk. To adapt to the recent downward shift while keeping safety for variability, I set L to default (promised lead time=2). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples, capturing the recent lower regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk versus using the earlier elevated mean while still accounting for observed variability and the 2-period lead time; it balances service level vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average observed ~1.57. To let backend internal formulas use observed lead-time history, set L via calculate. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (this leverages full history while L reflects observed lead-time mix). This balances service (capture elevated mean through backend) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand remains elevated vs. the 2019 Jan historical mean: last 5 demands (Periods 12-16) = [131,97,113,137,157], mean=127 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=338 units \u2014 below (1+L)*recent_mean if L=2 (3*127=381), so pipeline alone likely insufficient. Observed concluded lead times have frequently been 2 and sometimes 1, and prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2; therefore use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 samples) to capture the current elevated regime while avoiding older low-demand data. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to target a base stock matching the recent higher demand (improves service) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost parity with profit ($1/$1).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=16, in-transit=256. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (1\u20132) but early confirmation exists for 2; recent demand has been elevated vs. Jan baseline but shows variability (Periods 13\u201317 demands = 97,113,137,157,109). I keep L at the promised lead time to remain conservative given mixed lead-time observations. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5-week demand regime (captures current higher-but-variable demand) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the freshest data. This balances service level (respond to recent higher demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=352 (large pipeline arriving in future). Concluded lead times (observed) average ~1.56 periods; I pick calculate so backend uses observed average rather than the promised 2. Recent demand has been elevated vs. historical; latest 5 concluded demands (Periods 14-18 = 113,137,157,109,83) show a more current mean, so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current regime. I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce the risk of over-ordering from old low-demand history while respecting the realized lead-time distribution and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has moderated from the earlier spike: last 5 demand samples (Periods 15-19) = [137,157,109,83,74], mean=112.0. On-hand=22 + in-transit=264 provides ample coverage vs. expected demand; no clear new lead-time change in concluded history (arrivals still show 1\u20132 periods). I choose L=default (use promised 2 periods) to avoid overreacting to intermittent 1-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent cooling from the earlier high regime while still reacting to the last 5 weeks. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings bias orders to match the recent mean demand over the (1+L) review+lead window and avoid excess holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has declined from the spring peak; latest 5 periods (P16-20) average demand \u224896.4/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (sufficient pipeline but arrival timing uncertain). Promised lead time=2 and historical concludes show mixed 1\u20132; I keep L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower summer regime (5 most recent samples P16-20). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce target base stock relative to spring peak, lowering holding cost while matching recent demand and the sizable in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Periods 16-20 avg=96.4/week vs prior Periods 7-11 avg=166.2/week (\u221269.8 units, \u221242.0%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent concluded history shows lead times have averaged ~1.5 periods with mixed 1\u20132 observations and several delayed arrivals; pipeline is large (314 units) while on-hand=0 and recent demand has declined since the mid-period spike (Periods 17\u201321 recent demands = 109,83,74,59,54). To be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime, set L to the empirically estimated average (calculate) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current lower mean and reduced volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the latest downshift while the OR backend retains promised lead-time handling.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been low since the Period 21 regime shift (last 5 demands avg=50/week). On-hand=0 + in-transit=264 provides cover vs near-term demand, but we must set parameters to reflect the recent lower demand and variable lead times (mostly 1-2). I set L using recent_N (N=5) to capture the short-term average lead time from the last 5 observed arrivals (mix of 1s and 2s). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std, which reduces order targets to match the recently lower demand and limits excess holding cost while keeping reasonable service given in-transit stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has fallen sharply since the Period 21 regime shift (Periods 16-20 avg=96.4, then weeks 20-24 demands = [59,54,29,34,24]). On-hand=0, in-transit=264. Observed concluded lead times vary (recent observations produce average ~1.6). To reflect the confirmed variability in lead time use recent_N over the last 10 observed lead-time samples. For demand I use a recent_N = 5 (most recent 5 weeks) to capture the low post-shift demand regime; sigma estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the low recent demand while accounting for lead-time variability; existing in-transit (264) should cover the (1+L)*recent mean but the backend cap will limit over-ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent demand has fallen sharply: Periods 22-25 = [29,34,24,15] (avg 25.5). Pipeline is 264 units, on-hand 0. Historical concluded lead times average ~1.55 periods; to reflect observed variability I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand forecast uses the most recent stable low-demand regime (Periods 22-25) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 (regime length=4). This keeps target inventory aligned to the new low demand while the OR backend will cap ordering; using recent data reduces overstock risk given high in-transit volume and equal profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Periods 22-25 avg=25.5/week vs prior Periods 16-20 avg=96.4/week (\u221270.9 units, \u221273.6%), sustained over 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=264. Historical concluded lead times (11 samples) average \u22481.545 \u2192 use calculated average to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. Recent demand has fallen to a low regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201326) = [29,34,24,15,13], recent mean \u224823.0. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to this low regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to current low demand while accounting for ~1.55 period lead time and the sizable in-transit pipeline (264) to avoid over-ordering given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead-times have been 1\u20132 but earlier confirmation exists for 2; no new sustained lead-time change. I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new low-demand regime (use last 6 observed samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect current lower variance. These choices keep orders aligned to the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock given large in-transit inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has fallen to low summer levels: last 5 demands = [24,15,13,20,25], recent mean \u224819.4/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times historically average 1.5 periods (mix of 1 and 2). To avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, use recent demand estimates (last 5) to reflect the sustained low regime and keep safety stock small. Chosen L method uses observed average lead time (calculate) so backend accounts for mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to focus on current low-demand regime and reduce orders against the large in-transit pipeline.

Observed lead times in concluded history vary (1\u20132), average ~1.55. To be conservative about irregular arrivals but let backend use observed average, set L via calculate (uses observed lead-time average). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current low-demand regime (last 5 samples), so base-stock and cap reflect reduced demand and limit holding costs given no on-hand inventory and substantial in-transit units.

No new sustained lead-time evidence since earlier confirmation of 2-period lead time. To avoid overstock given profit=holding cost, I forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low-demand regime and preserve the backend's safety-cap cap. Selected L=default to use promised lead time (2), mu_hat recent_N=5 to reflect (1+L)-period demand in the current low regime, and sigma_hat recent_N=5 for volatility from the same recent window. This balances service with holding-cost risk given sizable in-transit inventory.

Promised lead time is 2 and historical conclusions show mixed 1-2 but no new sustained lead-time change; use default promised L to keep alignment with supplier promise. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the clear low-demand regime (captures most recent five weeks). This keeps the base-stock small (reducing holding cost) while pipeline inventory covers upcoming demand; using recent_N prevents over-ordering given sustained low demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has been low for several weeks (Periods 28-32: 25,16,19,24,7). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (arrival not yet concluded). Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed series: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2 \u2192 avg ~1.55), so I use the calculated average lead time. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks (captures current downward shift) for both mean and volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock anchored to the recent lower demand to avoid excess holding cost while the L estimate accounts for observed lead-time variability and reduces stockout risk given the in-transit pipeline uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been low and stable since the regime shifts recorded in carry-over (Periods 22+). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (sufficient pipeline). Observed historical lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; I'll let backend compute the empirical average from concluded arrivals (method: calculate). Demand forecast should reflect the recent low-demand regime: I use a recent_N demand estimate covering the last 8 weeks (Periods 26\u201333) where demand averaged \u224817.8/wk to avoid overstocking. Volatility should match the same recent window (sigma recent_N, N=8). These choices align safety stock to current low demand and the averaged observed lead time, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has been low since Period 26 (recent 8-period avg \u224819.6/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 units. Use lead-time inference from concluded arrivals (mixed 1\u20132); set L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times. Forecast demand over review+lead (1+L) using recent data to reflect the persistent low-demand regime: choose recent_N with N=8 (Periods 27\u201334) which captures the most recent stable low-demand behavior. Use the same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current low demand and avoids overstock given high holding cost (holding=profit), while the sizable in-transit (264) will be reconciled by backend pipeline when computing final order.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 26 (avg ~25.5/week through Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=264; several prior shipments were delayed/lost historically but lead-time evidence is mixed (observed 1 and 2 periods). I retain promised lead time to avoid over-correcting for intermittent delays. For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N over the most recent 10 weeks (regime length ~10 weeks, N=10) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low demand and lower volatility, which reduces orders and holding cost while maintaining service for the current regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 22 (weekly demands: 29,34,24,15,13,20,25,16,19,24,7,18,8,15,14; mean\u224818.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 which comfortably covers (~3 periods) of expected demand. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concludes confirm 2-period arrivals earlier; I keep L=default. I use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (N=15 equals the available recent low-demand samples, within the 3\u201320 cap). This yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std for sigma_hat, keeping service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 33-37: 18,8,15,14,22; avg\u224815.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (sufficient pipeline for multiple weeks). Earlier periods confirmed lead time=2. To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost, I use recent demand estimates (5-week regime) and keep promised lead time. This balances service vs holding by sizing base stock to recent low demand and reflecting current pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=264. Promised lead time=2. Recent realized demands (Periods 34-38) are low (8,15,14,22,15 -> avg \u224814.8), so I forecast using the recent low-demand regime. No new sustained lead-time evidence beyond established history. I select L=default to use promised lead time, mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility and keeps orders small given holding cost = profit). This keeps base-stock and cap conservative while the in-transit 264 provides coverage against unexpected short-term spikes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 26 (weekly demands mostly 7\u201325); last 14 concluded weeks (P26\u2013P39) average ~15 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (sufficient to cover multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times historically alternate 1\u20132 but earlier confirmed as 2 (Period 5); no new sustained lead-time evidence, so use promised/default. Set L=default to keep backend lead-time assumption at promised 2. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to capture current reduced demand (N=14). Same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. This keeps mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the sustained low-demand regime and prevents over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and equal profit/holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been low and stable since the regime shifts recorded in carry-over (Periods 26+). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 which already covers multiple weeks given low current demand. No new evidence of lead-time change; keep promised lead time. I select L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 5 observed weeks average \u224814.6 units/week) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low variability. These choices prevent over-ordering given a large in-transit pipeline while maintaining service for observed low weekly demand and balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has fallen sharply and remained low over the past 5 weeks (Periods 37-41 avg \u224813/week). On-hand=0 but in-transit=264 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); use the observed-average to let backend adjust for variability. To avoid overstock given large pipeline and low recent demand, forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks. Chosen methods: L calculate (uses average observed lead times \u22481.55), mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to anchor to the low recent regime, sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This biases the OR engine toward small base stock (q=0.5 so z*=0) while respecting observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit balance.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 27 (weekly samples P27\u2013P42 avg ~15 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=264; promised lead time=2 but many in-transit units have not concluded recently (possible lost/delayed shipments). I retain L=default (use promised 2) because no new concluded arrivals to reliably revise lead time. To capture the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 16 concluded demand samples (Periods 27\u201342) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand regime and avoids overstocking against the lingering pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Periods 27-42 avg=15.0/week vs prior Periods 22-25 avg=25.5/week (\u221210.5 units, \u221241.2%), sustained over 16 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has settled into the low regime (Periods 27-43 avg \u224815/wk; last 5 weeks avg = 8.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 \u2014 pipeline already covers multiple review+lead periods (L+1=3). Promised lead time retained. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant for immediate replenishment) and avoid inflating forecast from older high-demand periods. This keeps the base stock low (reducing holding cost) while the large in-transit position preserves service.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 27 (avg \u224815/week through Period 44) while we currently have 0 on-hand and 264 units in-transit. Observed lead times vary (1 or 2 periods). To reflect the recent low-demand regime and recent lead-time behavior, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 27\u201344). This keeps target base-stock aligned to current low demand while the large in-transit position prevents aggressive replenishment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): recent demand is low (Periods 41-45 = 6,9,4,7,5 -> recent mean ~6.2/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mix of 1\u20132 with recent variability. To avoid ordering into an already-large pipeline and to reflect the clear low-demand regime confirmed since Period 43, I use recent_N=5 for lead time and demand stats so the backend computes L and (1+L)\xd7mean from the most recent 5 observed samples; sigma from the same recent window captures current low volatility. This balances service (small safety stock) against holding cost given high pipeline and low current demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=264 (no recent concludes showing arrivals). Recent demand has been low for 5 periods (P42-P46: 9,4,7,5,13; avg=7.6/week). Promised lead time remains 2 and no concluded evidence of a sustained change to actual lead time, so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To react to the clear recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5 weeks' mean and variability across the review+lead window). This reduces target base stock vs historical high-demand periods and limits holding cost exposure given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 47: Periods 42-46 avg=7.6/week vs prior Periods 27-42 avg=15.0/week (\u22127.4 units, \u221249.3%), sustained over 5 periods.
