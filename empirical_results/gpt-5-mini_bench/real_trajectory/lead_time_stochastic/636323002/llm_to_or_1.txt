Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) = [1,3,27,17,34], sample mean=16.4/week indicating recent high variability and elevated demand driven by late-Jan/early-Feb spikes. No concluded arrivals exist to infer lead-time deviations; use promised lead time. Use default forecasting so backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher mean due to recent spikes) against low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19). No evidence of lost shipments or sustained regime shift yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=90. Historical weekly samples (Jan): [1,3,27,17,34]; recent concluded demands: Period1=43, Period2=179 (sharp uptick). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer lead-time change; orders placed in P1/P2 may still be en route given promised L=2. To adapt to rapidly rising recent demand while remaining conservative about lead-time, keep L as promised (default) so backend uses promised lead time, use EWMA to tilt the demand forecast toward recent high observations (gamma=0.5), and keep sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. This balances higher service level for recent surge while avoiding over-committing to an unconfirmed sustained regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=299, historical weekly samples show low baseline (samples: 1,3,27,17,34). Three consecutive concluded periods (P1\u2013P3) show ordered units but arrived=0, so actual lead time is unresolved; do not override promised lead time yet. Use default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample mean/variance to compute base_stock; this is conservative given uncertain arrivals and limited sample size.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (41, 49, 209) have not concluded by Period 4 (arrived=0) \u2014 3 consecutive missed arrivals, suggesting lost shipments or actual lead time >2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded arrivals show Period2 order had lead_time=2 (arrived in P4); Periods1 and 3 orders remain unconfirmed (possible lost shipments). Recent realized demand (P1\u2013P4 = 43,179,136,67) is much higher than the older sample set, indicating a sustained upward regime since Period1. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher mean over the last four periods, and set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand regime while acknowledging current in-transit units and potential lost earlier shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized demand is elevated and volatile (Period1-5 demands: 43,179,136,67,35) with a recent downtrend but still above historical pre-period samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=497 \u2014 several earlier orders missed promised arrivals suggesting some shipments are lost or lead time has effectively lengthened. I set lead time explicitly to 3 to guard against further overdue arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N=3 window (Periods 3-5) to capture the current elevated regime while reacting to the recent decline. Sigma uses the same recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward higher coverage for the longer effective lead time and elevated recent demand, improving service at modest holding cost given profit/holding ($19/$1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weekly demand has been volatile but moderating (P2\u2013P6 demand: 179,136,67,35,52). Current on-hand=141 and in-transit=304 provide substantial coverage vs expected demand; however multiple earlier missed arrivals (Periods 1\u20133) and varying observed lead times (1 and 2 periods) motivate using observed lead-time average. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to let backend adapt to observed variability. For demand forecast, use recent_N (last 6 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent regime (captures recent spike then moderation) so the base-stock reflects current demand pattern while limiting exposure to older low-volume samples. These choices balance service level (profit>holding cost) against holding cost given strong pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has settled near ~40\u201370 units/week after an earlier spike (Periods 2\u20133). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival from P2) and 1 (P6 arrival from P5) \u2192 use averaged lead time. On-hand=100 and in-transit=304 give large pipeline coverage; still choose a recent-demand forecast to reflect the post-spike regime. Choices: L: calculate (average of observed lead times = 1.5) to let backend adjust review+lead period; mu_hat: recent_N N=4 using last 4 demand periods (Periods 4\u20137) to capture the stabilized mean (~49 units/week) scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat: recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce overstating demand from the earlier spike while accounting for current pipeline and fluctuating lead times, balancing service vs. holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been high and variable (last 5 period demands = 67,35,52,41,99; mean\u224858.8). Observed lead times are mixed (one observed =2, one =1) so I use the empirical average to let the backend infer typical lead time. I use a recent_N (N=5) demand estimate to capture the current elevated demand regime and the same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given high recent demand while letting the OR engine compute appropriate safety stock given profit/holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 showed order from P2 arrived with LT=2; Period6 showed order from P5 arrived with LT=1 -> mix of 2 and 1. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Recent realized demand (Periods 4\u20139 = 67,35,52,41,99,32) shows a higher regime than the small 2019-Jan samples, so use recent_N (last 6 concluded periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon. This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) while avoiding excessive holding by relying on recent variability estimates. No explicit correction for missing shipments here; in-transit=304 will be counted by backend when computing pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = 2 periods for P2->P4, 1 period for P5->P6), so I use a recent average to capture current mixed lead-time regime. Demand has increased recently (Periods 6\u201310 demands = 52,41,99,32,23); I use the last 5 periods to estimate mean and volatility so the OR backend builds a base stock that reflects the recent higher demand while the lead-time averaging tempers ordering given pipeline uncertainty. This also accounts for possible lost/delayed shipments by avoiding over-reliance on older samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Recent concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) => average ~1.5; some earlier orders were missing/lost but only concluded data is reliable. Recent demand (Periods 7-11) = [41,99,32,23,24], recent mean \u224843.8. To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit stock and evidence of shorter-than-promised arrivals at times, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times average). Use mu_hat recent_N on last 5 periods to capture the recent higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness; sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to current demand patterns while the L estimate accounts for observed variability in lead time and helps prevent excess holding given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand has been low-moderate (many zeros recently, last 8 periods demand: 52,41,99,32,23,24,22) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times: observed 2 periods (P2\u2192P4) and 1 period (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 therefore use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand moments by (1+L) from the entire sample set (conservative given mixed history and in-transit volume). This balances service (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=304; prior concludes show mixed actual lead times: observed arrivals imply lead times of 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6). Several early orders were delayed/lost but recent arrivals confirm shorter/variable lead time. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1 and 2 \u2192 ~1.5). Recent demand has declined from earlier peaks; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast/volatility on the latest five demand periods (reduces overstating demand and holding cost). This balances service level (accounting for variable lead time) while minimizing holding cost by using recent lower demand to set the base stock.

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times: 2 (order P2\u2192P4) and 1 (order P5\u2192P6) \u2014 variable but recent evidence favors a short lead time ~1\u20132. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P10\u2013P14) = [23,24,22,8,23], reflecting lower post-peak demand; use recent data to avoid overstocking. Set L using recent observed lead times (N=2) to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR backend targets a modest base-stock (balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while avoiding large replenishments given many units already in-transit or possibly lost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. History shows volatile/Delayed arrivals: observed lead times = {P2\u2192arrived P4:2, P5\u2192arrived P6:1} and multiple earlier missed arrivals (Periods 1\u20133), so actual lead time appears variable. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability between 1\u20132). Recent demand (Periods 7\u201315: 41,99,32,23,24,22,8,23,18) is lower and different from the initial training samples, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. These choices reduce overstock risk from older high-demand samples while preserving service by reflecting recent demand and observed lead-time variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=304 but history shows intermittent arrivals and several missed arrivals earlier (Periods 1\u20133 orders never concluded). Observed lead times from concluded messages: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) \u2014 variable lead time. Recent demand shows a spike in Period 16 (93) after a run of low demand (Periods 12\u201315: 22,8,23,18) indicating a potential recent uptick; to be responsive I average recent demand. Choices: set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability 1 and 2); set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to weight the last 5 demand periods (captures the recent spike while smoothing prior low demand); set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the recent higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders; calculating L from observations avoids trusting the promised value given missed arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows order on P2 lead_time=2; P6 shows order on P5 lead_time=1 \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent variability). Recent demand shows a regime with higher variability and a spike (last 5 demands = 8,23,18,93,69); use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current elevated mean and for sigma_hat to capture increased volatility. These choices aim to adapt base-stock to recent demand while letting OR backend combine with promised lead-time and caps to limit over-ordering given possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Extended missing arrivals: no arrivals during Periods 7\u201317 (11 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0) despite in-transit inventory reported; suggests lost shipments or actual lead time > promised (evidence: repeated arrived=0 P7\u2013P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. History shows many missed/non-concluding arrivals (P7\u2013P18 conclude: arrived=0) suggesting lost shipments, but the only CONCLUDED lead times are 2 (P4: order P2) and 1 (P6: order P5). I therefore use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (conservative, evidence-based). Recent demand has been elevated and variable; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201318 demand = 23,18,93,69,52 avg\u224851) so the backend scales (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std accordingly. This keeps orders responsive to the recent higher demand while the large in-transit (304) reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=304 but no concluded arrivals since Period 6 (sustained missed arrivals through Periods 7\u201319) \u2014 suggests lost/delayed shipments, however there is NO concluded arrival evidence to confidently revise actual lead time. I therefore keep L as promised (default). Recent observed demand (Periods 15\u201319 = 18,93,69,52,68) averages 60 units/week; to capture the current demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean based on recent demand. Demand volatility is similarly taken from the last 5 periods (recent_N N=5) for sigma_hat. These choices hedge service (use recent demand spike) while not overreacting to inconclusive lead-time signals and avoid accumulating excess inventory against potentially lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). History shows prolonged missing arrivals since Period 7 with large recent weekly demand (periods 16\u201320: 93,69,52,68,99) and on-hand=0 but in-transit=304. Promised L=2 appears unreliable; I choose explicit L=3 to modestly extend lead-time to cover observed delays without overreacting to potential lost shipments. Demand has clearly shifted up in recent weeks, so I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the five most recent demand observations) to let the backend compute (1+L)*mean over recent regime. Volatility is also elevated; I set sigma_hat recent_N=5 so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std over the same recent window. These choices prioritize satisfying high recent demand while accounting for longer effective lead time and keeping holding costs reasonable given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=369, long run of zero arrivals since Period 7 and recent order in Period 21 still not concluded. Historical demand samples mean=16.4/week (samples: 1,3,27,17,34). Multiple consecutive missed arrivals indicate actual lead time >> promised 2 or lost shipments. To protect service I set L explicit=15 (covers prolonged delay observed) so backend's (1+L)\xd7mean demand increases target inventory; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This raises replenishment coverage for the extended outage while the backend cap will limit extreme orders, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >> promised: no arrivals during Periods 7\u201321 (15 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0) despite in-transit inventory reported; suggests lost shipments or actual lead time >=15 periods (evidence: arrivals=0 P7\u2013P21).

To avoid under-ordering against long/unreliable pipeline, set L explicitly to 15. Demand has shifted upward and stabilized since Period 16 (P16\u2013P22 demands = 93,69,52,68,99,132,97); use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime volatility and mean over the last 7 periods.

Recent conclude (Period 23) showed arrivals for orders placed in Periods 21 (lead_time=2) and 22 (lead_time=1); earlier concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,1,2,1 -> average ~1.5. Past long run of arrived=0 suggests intermittent delays rather than permanent loss; using observed lead times average to let OR adapt. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2,1} (orders from P2,P5,P21,P22) -> average ~1.5, so actual lead time appears around 1\u20132 periods and not the extreme multi-period loss previously suspected. On-hand=0, in-transit=435 (large pipeline). Recent realized demand (use last 8 conclude demand samples P17\u2013P24 = [69,52,68,99,132,97,126,74], mean=89.625) reflects a higher demand regime than the sparse early-sample data. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest sustained demand regime (captures seasonal/sales spike). This balances service (higher mu_hat for recent elevated demand) while the OR cap will limit orders given large in-transit; using recent statistics avoids underordering into an active demand period and mitigates holding cost by relying on cap and observed pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

History shows mixed actual lead times: observed concluded lead_times = 2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P23 arrival from P21), 1 (P23 arrival from P22) \u2192 average ~1.5. Several long stretches of missed arrivals suggest some lost shipments, but recent concludes confirm actual lead time fluctuates around 1\u20132. Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of available demand samples; this balances service level vs. holding cost given uncertain/variable lead time and possible lost shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=37, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times (observed) = {2,1,2,1,3} \u2192 avg \u22481.8; recent arrivals show variable but finite lead-times after earlier long missing-arrival run. Demand has clearly shifted up in recent periods (sustained higher weekly demand since Period 7). To reflect variable/shorter observed lead time use calculated average; to capture the recent higher demand regime use recent_N on the most recent 20 demand samples. Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (raise base-stock to meet higher recent demand) while keeping holding cost in check by using observed lead-time average rather than the promised 2 when computing the pipeline horizon.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. History shows many prolonged zero-arrival concludes (P7\u2013P21) suggesting lost/delayed shipments, but recent concluded arrivals give observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,3} (avg\u22481.8). To balance service vs holding cost I let the backend infer L from observed lead times (calculate) so it captures recent variability, and use default demand/volatility scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so demand estimates leverage full sample history while accounting for chosen L. This keeps orders conservative given holding cost $1 vs profit $19 and large in-transit quantity.

On-hand=0, in-transit=310. Use L estimated from observed lead times (calculate) so backend accounts for realized variability. Demand has recently been high (recent concluded demand samples: 74,90,94,79,102); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand history shows intermittent high weekly demand spikes but overall sample mean is 16.4 (from provided historical samples). Observed concluded lead-times (from conclude messages): 2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P6 from P5), 2 (P23 from P21), 1 (P23 from P22), 3 (P26 from P23) \u2014 average \u22481.8\u22482. In-transit=310 units; on-hand=0 and many past missed arrivals suggest variability and some lost shipments, but concluded evidence supports average lead time \u22482. To be robust while keeping holding costs low, use calculated average lead time (backend will average observed lead times) and default demand sizing so the OR engine computes base stock using all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility. This balances service vs. holding cost given uncertain arrivals and observed lead-time variability.

Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,3,2} (avg \u22481.83) and long stretches of zero arrivals earlier, plus current on-hand=0 and in-transit=307. Because observed lead times vary and some shipments were delayed/lost, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect realized lead-time risk. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set\u2014this balances service level (using realized L) against holding cost without overfitting to recent volatile demand spikes.

Historical concluded lead times: 2,1,2,1,3,2 (avg\u22481.83) \u2014 variable but centered near 2; many earlier long stretches of arrived=0 indicate intermittent delays/lost shipments. Demand has shifted to a higher, more volatile regime since Period 7 (sustained weeks of high demand vs. initial Jan samples). To balance service vs holding given uncertain LT and recent high demand, I set L to be calculated from all observed lead times (lets backend infer avg LT \u22481.83). For demand and volatility I use recent_N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent variance, which raises base_stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=315. History shows variable actual lead times (observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,3,2,2,1], avg\u22481.75) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 23 (recent demands: P23\u2013P32 = [126,74,90,94,79,102,80,57,37,36], mean\u224877.5). Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent concluded arrivals confirm lead times around 1\u20133 with average <2. To balance service vs holding cost: set L by calculate to reflect observed average lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent elevated-demand regime (recent_N=10) so the base-stock targets cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under current demand; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent concluded lead-times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,2,1,3,2,2,1] -> average ~1.75, so I let the backend calculate L from observed lead-times to capture this variability. Demand has clearly shifted upward in recent months (Periods 26\u201333 demands = [94,79,102,80,57,37,36,40], recent mean \u224865.6). I choose recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the recent higher-demand regime. I also choose recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-demand samples. These choices balance service (capture elevated recent demand and observed lead-time variability) against holding cost by using recent statistics rather than inflating forecasts with older low-demand history.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with variable lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,3,2,2,1,3], avg \u22481.89) and several earlier prolonged stretches of arrived=0 suggesting shipment delays/losses. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures realized variability). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecast (and uncertainty) are computed from the full historical samples scaled by (1+L); this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/variable lead time and large in-transit quantity.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical conclude messages show variable but generally ~2-period lead times with several late/missed arrivals; recent evidence implies actual lead time close to but slightly under 2 on average. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (better reflects actual behavior vs promised). Demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use 'default' to leverage the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), providing a stable baseline given mixed demand history and many zero-arrival periods. This keeps orders responsive to observed lead-time behavior while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise; it also relies on the large in-transit position (304) to cover upcoming demand if those shipments conclude.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). SKU 636323002 has on-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but centered lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,2,1,3,2,2,1,3 \u2192 avg\u22481.89\u22482). Demand history shows intermittent high weekly demand (samples from 2019-01 show spikes). Several earlier periods had prolonged arrived=0 runs, but recent concludes include multiple arrivals with lead times around 2, so I treat lead time as the empirically observed average rather than the promised fixed value. I select L = calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability ~2). For demand I use mu_hat = default so the backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) which blends all historical demand but scales with the chosen L; sigma_hat = default to let backend scale overall volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using observed lead-time-adjusted forecast) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows intermittent concluded arrivals with observed lead times around 2 but many long gaps and past prolonged missing arrivals; average concluded lead time slightly under 2. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338) has been ~34,36,24,35,25 (mean ~30.8), indicating current regime mean ~31 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded shipments (method=calculate) and use a recent-window demand estimate (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast reflects the latest demand regime and volatility while avoiding stale early-sample bias. This also helps avoid over-ordering if some in-transit shipments are lost because the backend will cap orders using its cap calculation.

Many intermediate periods showed arrived=0 but there are multiple confirmed arrivals with lead times around 1\u20133; no new sustained shift detected. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (reflects empirical ~1.9 vs promised 2). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level with holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W = [2,1,2,1,3,2,2,1,3], avg \u22481.89) and many missed/late arrivals; therefore I let the backend compute an average observed lead time rather than trusting the promised 2. Demand history shows no sustained recent regime shift worth overriding the default demand estimator, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across samples. These settings balance service level (by using observed lead-time calc) vs holding cost (defaults avoid overreacting to censored/irregular arrivals).

Given mixed evidence of delays/losses but the observed lead-time samples average slightly below promised=2, set L using calculate (avg observed). Demand history is noisy due to stockouts; I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) to balance service level vs holding cost rather than overfitting recent zero-sales caused by stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=304 but conclude history shows prolonged missing/delayed arrivals (many consecutive arrived=0 since P7, earlier insights indicate lead time >> promised). I set L explicitly to 15 periods to reflect confirmed multi-period delays and avoid under-ordering. Demand has recently picked up (last 5 demands: 25,29,24,31,62; mean\u224834.2); I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean, capturing the elevated short-run demand over the extended review+lead horizon. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase order targets to cover the long effective lead time while using recent demand to balance holding cost vs service level given large in-transit uncertainty.

Use lead-time inference from concluded arrivals (average of observed lead times) to adapt to actual variability. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time from concluded messages. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the backend combine full historical demand with the inferred lead time; this balances service level (via increased L) against holding cost without overfitting to short recent spikes.

Concluded history shows prolonged missing arrivals (arrived=0 from P7\u2013P21) indicating actual lead time much longer than promised or lost shipments. To be conservative, set explicit lead time to 15 periods to force the OR engine to cover a long pipeline. Demand history is noisy due to extended stockouts; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples rather than relying on recent sparse sales. This increases supply coverage for the extended lead-time while letting the engine balance service vs holding cost using full-sample statistics.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand recovered from many zero-stock periods; last concluded demands (Periods 38\u201345) show active weekly demand (25,29,24,24,31,62,24,15,21). On-hand=40, in-transit=423\u2014pipeline large but prior history shows long/delayed arrivals; however most recent concludes (Periods 43\u219245) show arrivals consistent with promised L=2. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (use backend's knowledge) while relying on recent demand to capture the current active regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest 8 demand observations (captures current sales pattern and avoids diluting with long earlier zero-demand regime). This balances service level (using recent higher mean) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=29, in-transit=423 (large pipeline but many historical missed arrivals). Historical concluded lead-times (where arrivals observed) average \u22481.9 periods with variability (observed LT samples: 1\u20133). Demand history shows intermittent spikes and many zero-stock lost-sales; recent concluded arrivals (P45 from P43, LT=2) suggest supplier can deliver but past gaps indicate variability. I choose to let the backend infer average observed lead time (calculate) so L reflects empirical mean (~1.9). For demand scale and uncertainty I use the backend defaults (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the full sample history scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using observed LT average and full-sample demand) while avoiding overreacting to noisy intermittent arrivals and potential lost shipments.
