Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Observed demand samples show a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (36,100,215). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Use L=default (promised 2). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (mean of last 3 = 117 units per period, scaled by 1+L in backend). Volatility is also elevated; use recent_N N=3 so sigma reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed surge while letting the OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=0.5, recent mean (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=117 (+23,300%)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent sample mean = 117 (samples 2019-01-21,01-28,02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=267 (order placed P1) \u2014 with promised L=2, in-transit roughly covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand but arrival not yet concluded, so treat lead time as promised. Set L=default to keep backend using promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the new higher-demand regime (samples: 36,100,215) so base-stock responds to sustained uplift while avoiding dilution by the two earlier low samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and existing in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. Recent demand regime confirmed since 2019-01-21: last 3 samples = {36,100,215} mean=117 (much higher than earlier samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (sum of prior orders 267+215) which already covers ~3-period expected demand (3\xd7117=351), so no emergency uplifts. I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded messages so far show no confirmed longer lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21; mu_hat uses recent 3-period mean scaled by (1+L) to reflect review+lead coverage. Volatility also increased in the new regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect higher variability. These choices give the OR backend a base_stock anchored to the new higher mean while avoiding over-ordering because pipeline already suffices for the next (1+L) periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift from 2019-01-21 with recent high weekly demand (samples: 36,100,215). Period 1 order (ordered P1) failed to arrive by its expected conclude (arrived=0), indicating actual lead time may exceed the promised 2 periods; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the three high-demand samples) and sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher demand while capping risk given potential shipment delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime: last 4 period demands = {167,156,125,117} (mean=141.25). On-hand=98, in-transit=383; note some early orders did not arrive but we observed a confirmed arrival: order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (avg observed = 2). To capture the recent elevated demand regime I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 4 periods (3*141.25\u2248423.75). For variability I use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher base-stock for sustained higher demand) while relying on observed lead time to avoid over-ordering amid lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 with high weekly demand (recent mean \u2248117 over last 3 high-demand samples). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 383 (pipeline large but arrivals previously delayed; lead time has been confirmed at 2 periods). To protect service during the confirmed elevated-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding cost, I retain the promised/confirmed lead time and base mu_hat on the recent high-demand regime (most relevant N=3 weeks). I set sigma_hat using the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices yield a base-stock tuned to current high demand and volatility while the OR backend will cap orders to limit over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained weekly demands >> prior weeks). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 some early orders (Period1 order) appear overdue/missing despite later arrivals confirming lead_time=2. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (periods with concluded arrivals average to 2). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime; N=8 captures the most recent 8 demand samples to balance responsiveness and variance. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid overstocking against older low-demand data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent realized weekly demand has stabilized ~100-170 units (Period1-7 demands: 167,156,125,117,103,115,112). On-hand=0, in-transit=412 (outstanding orders: P1=267,P3=56,P4=60,P7=29). Previous concluded info confirms lead time = 2 periods. I therefore keep L aligned with promised/confirmed lead time and use recent_N forecasts to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 7 observed demand periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and safety stock to meet current weekly demand while limiting holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand regime since 2019-01-21 is higher (period demands: 125,117,103,115,112,57) so I use a recent-window forecast. On-hand=0 and in-transit=383 equals outstanding orders from Periods 1,3,4 (267+56+60). Several early orders are delayed beyond the promised 2-period lead time, but concluded messages show two observed lead times (2 from P2->P4 and 1 from P7->P8). To balance service vs holding cost: set L using the average of the two observed lead times (recent_N over last 2 observations) so backend accounts for actual variability; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 demand samples (regime length) to capture the new higher-demand regime while including the recent dip. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand without overcommitting given delayed arrivals in transit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand remains elevated vs pre-2019 but has softened in the last 2 weeks (periods 8-9: 57,72). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2192 use calculate to capture actual observed average lead time (1.5). To be responsive to the recent softening while still covering near-term demand, set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 demand samples) so the forecast reflects the most recent regime. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service level (use observed lead-time avg and recent demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Recent demand has moderated from the early spike; last 5 observed demands (Periods 6-10) = [115,112,57,72,63] (mean \u224883.8). Observed lead times are mixed but recent evidence shows 2 then 1 \u2192 use a short recent average to reflect variability. I set L using recent_N (N=2) to capture the last two observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime, limiting overreaction to early high outliers. These choices bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are variable (one 2-period, one 1-period). I use L='calculate' to average observed lead times (captures variability). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (balances service vs holding given large pipeline and equal profit/holding costs). This keeps order targets responsive to recent lower weekly demand while accounting for recent higher weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Recent demand has settled above pre-2019 levels; last 6 period demands = [112,57,72,63,98,110], so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Observed concluded lead times = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8); I average observed lead times rather than rely solely on promised. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained ~85 units/week demand while respecting observed lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent realized weekly demand (last 6 periods) = [57,72,63,98,110,89], so use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand level and volatility while (1+L) scaling will be applied by backend. This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory and some variability in lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. Recent demand (Periods 4\u201314) shows a stable high-demand regime (~57\u2013117, recent mean ~95) after the early-Jan jump; on-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have been 2 and 1 periods; promised lead time=2 and prior carry-over confirmed a 2-period arrival previously, so use default promised L to avoid overreacting to one faster arrival. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 4\u201314, 11 samples) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and captures current variability; this leverages the large in-transit to avoid excessive new orders while preserving service.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent weekly demand has been consistently elevated since 2019-01-21 (typical weekly demands ~90\u2013115). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (pipeline sufficient to cover multiple weeks but some earlier shipments showed variable actual lead times). I set L to calculate so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1 and 2 period observations). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained higher-regime mean across the last ~13 weeks; same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the confirmed higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed W=2 (P2\u2192P4) and W=1 (P7\u2192P8). Because evidence is limited and variable, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (average) so the OR backend adapts to recent realized lead-time mean. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full historical demand series (1+L scaling) while the pipeline (383) will be considered when computing order quantity. No new sustained demand/lead-time regime meets the 3+period significance rule, so no carry-over insight added.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 2 and 1), so I use the average of observed lead times. Demand since the early-Feb spike has settled at lower levels across many recent periods (many weeks of sub-120 demand and a downward drift to 45 most recently). To keep service while limiting holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1), I bias the forecast toward recent demand by using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times: observed 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2192 mixed; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand regime: sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21; recent realized weekly demand has moderated vs early spike. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent 8 concluded demand observations (Periods 11\u201318 mean ~88.4) so the OR engine targets stock for current demand level while the backend-calculated L reflects observed lead-time mix. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand) versus holding cost given zero on-hand and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24. Recent demand has settled lower vs the early spike: last 9 observed demands (Periods 11\u201319) = [98,110,89,108,99,60,45,38,34], avg \u2248 74. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with variable lead times (observed 2 and 1). I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times history. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (captures Periods 11\u201319). This biases orders to current demand and avoids overstock despite a large in-transit position; recent_N volatility helps the OR engine size safety stock appropriately.

Historical concluded lead times observed = {2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P7\u2192P8)}; demand regime shifted up in late Jan but since Period 4 demand has settled to much lower levels (most recent 16 periods show consistent lower weekly demand, trending 115\u219221). To balance service vs holding cost given large in-transit stock and lower recent demand, set lead time via observed average (calculate) and forecast demand using a recent-window to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime. Use the same recent window for volatility to capture current variability and avoid over-ordering against early high outliers.

On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand, so we should not inflate lead time; use promised lead time to let backend apply its cap. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N=8 to capture the current lower-demand regime and its volatility so orders will be sized conservatively given the large in-transit stock and equal profit/holding costs.

Use promised lead time (default=2) because concluded history supports L=2 and no sustained change confirmed. For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast on the post-spike regime (reduces influence of Feb surge). This keeps base-stock responsive to current lower demand and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29. Recent demand has settled well below the Jan peak; last 12 periods (P13\u2013P24) average demand \u224855.5/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods, so we can size safety around recent lower-demand regime. Lead time history shows mixed 2 and 1 period observations; use calculated average to let backend infer current effective L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (last 12 samples) to capture the sustained lower-demand pattern and avoid carrying excess inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand settled at much lower levels since the Feb spike; last 20 concluded weekly demands are representative. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent, lower-demand regime (covers review+lead period).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 ample pipeline supply arriving in future periods. Historic data shows an early large-demand regime (Jan) then a sustained lower-demand regime through Periods 6\u201326. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2; no new lead-time evidence. To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit and recent lower demand, set L=default (use promised 2). For demand, use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent steady regime (Periods 7\u201326) and reduce influence of the early high-Jan spike. Use sigma recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent variability. These parameters bias the OR engine toward stocking for the recent lower-demand regime while the large pipeline limits additional ordering, balancing service vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2); to be conservative I let the OR engine compute the average from observations (calculate) so it infers current realized lead time. Demand since late Feb/Mar is in a lower, stable regime versus the Jan spike; I use a recent_N window to focus the forecast on the most recent behavior (capture current mean/volatility). recent_N N=20 balances responsiveness and sample size given available history. These settings keep base_stock tied to recent demand while letting the backend compute L from observed leads, helping trade service vs holding cost given profit=holding. No explicit adjustments for possible lost shipments now (no sustained multi-period loss signal).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demand has settled well below the Jan spike: last ~20 periods show mean ~57/week vs. the earlier extreme Jan regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4) and 1 (P8) \u2014 mix suggests average lead time between 1\u20132. I choose: L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to focus forecasting on the current lower-demand regime (reduces target base-stock vs. using the Jan spike). This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit units and equal profit/holding ($1), balancing service level vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Recent concluded history shows mixed lead-time observations (observed = 2, 1 \u2192 average ~1.5) and no new sustained lead-time shift; demand has remained in the post-Jan-21 regime (lower, variable). I choose L by calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent regime (last ~20 weeks) so mu_hat reflects current lower-demand regime while still smoothing variability. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings keep base_stock responsive to the recent lower average demand and the observed lead-time behavior, while the large in-transit position will be considered by the OR engine when computing net orders to avoid over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Recent weekly demand (Periods 19-30) averages ~53 units/week with moderate variance; earlier large spike in Jan-Feb is a past regime already recorded. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 2 and 1), so use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent steady demand regime (~last 12 weeks). This balances service (cover ~1+L periods of current demand) vs holding cost given zero on-hand and substantial in-transit inventory; large in-transit suggests caution but no confirmed lost shipments in concluded messages, so do not inflate lead time explicitly.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weekly demand has settled well below the large early-2019 spike; last 8 weeks show moderate, variable demand (weeks 24\u201331). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 a large pipeline exists (likely covering near-term demand but some shipments may be overdue/lost historically). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (evidence: observed lead_times = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P7\u2192P8)). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent variability rather than the early spike; this focuses the base-stock toward recent demand and limits excess holding. These parameters balance service (use recent demand to avoid stockouts given large in-transit) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts with the early spike.

Demand has been in a stable post-Jan spike regime for many periods; to emphasize recent behavior I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (captures ~most recent seasons while capping at 20). These settings let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost using observed recent demand and observed lead-time average, while accounting for the large in-transit pipeline.

Demand elevated since 2019-01-21 (already recorded). I keep L as promised (default=2) to match contract guidance and avoid over-correcting for occasional 1-period arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=20) to capture the last ~20 weeks' regime (removes early low samples and focuses on current seasonality). Sigma left as default to let backend apply full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use recent demand to size base stock) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Date 2019-10-07. Recent weekly demand (Periods 9\u201334) averages moderate values (~40\u201390) after the early 2019 spike; no new sustained regime shift detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely covers several weeks of demand but earlier arrivals were intermittent (some orders took 1\u20132 periods; some concluded=0), so use an empirically inferred lead time. Set L to calculate (average of observed concluded lead times) to reflect observed 1 and 2 period arrivals. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent seasonal/regime behaviour (gives (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 20 samples) so the backend sizes base-stock to current demand patterns while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering and holding cost risk.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concluded lead-time observations: one 2-period (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period (P7\u2192P8), so recent average lead-time slightly below promised. Demand has been stable since the large early spike (regime shift around 2019-01-21); recent weekly demand (last 12 concluded weeks) averages near typical levels seen through summer/autumn. To balance service vs holding cost with profit=holding cost, I use a calculated lead-time to reflect observed data and recent_N demand/volatility to react to the current steady regime while keeping the OR engine's pipeline target responsive to in-transit stock (383 units). These choices help the backend set base-stock around recent demand \xd7 (1+L) while capturing recent variance.

Demand since early Feb showed a large spike then settled to a lower steady weekly demand; using a recent window captures current regime. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=20) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand samples, so the forecast reflects the post-spike lower demand. sigma_hat left as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize avoiding excess new orders given substantial in-transit stock while adapting mean demand to the recent lower-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple periods (with promised L=2 this gives pipeline >> (1+L)\xd7recent demand). Historical lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior periods. Demand since late Jan shifted down from the initial spike and has been stable in recent months (~40\u2013100/week). To avoid overstocking given holding cost equals profit, use the promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from recent data to reflect the current lower regime. I choose recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent ~20 weeks of demand (reduces influence of the early spike) so the OR backend sizes orders to match current demand while the large in-transit quantity prevents immediate replenishment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers many weeks so avoid increasing target. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 (order P2 arrived P4) = 2, Period8 (order P7 arrived P8) = 1 \u2192 mix of 1\u20132. Demand has trended lower through autumn; recent 8 weeks (Periods 34\u201341 demands = [57,45,40,50,46,41,34,29], mean ~43.5) represent the current regime. I set L to the average observed lead time (calculate) to let backend reconcile promised vs. observed. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking given high pipeline inventory. These parameters bias the OR engine toward lower replenishment while preserving service given current in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. Recent demand (Periods 5\u201342) has been a lower, stable regime after the early large spike in Jan\u2013Feb. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 there is significant pipeline already. Observed concluded lead times: 2 periods (Period2\u2192Period4) and 1 period (Period7\u2192Period8); evidence mixed so use calculated average lead time. For demand I use the most recent stable regime (last ~38 periods); to capture current mean/variance while respecting caps I request recent_N with N=20 (per rules: cap at 20). This balances service (capture recent demand level) versus holding cost (we already have large pipeline) and lets the OR backend compute base_stock and capped order quantity accordingly.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concludes show mixed observed lead times (W=2 in P4, W=1 in P8); recent evidence limited so use a short recent average. Demand since mid-2019 settled to a lower regime (many weeks with demand ~20\u201365); use a recent-window forecast to capture current lower mean/volatility. Choices: L as recent_N (N=2) to average the two observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N (N=12) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the most recent 12 demand samples (captures current lower-demand regime); sigma_hat recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the OR backend responsive to the confirmed lower-demand regime and the mixed lead-time evidence, limiting excess ordering while protecting service given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent observed weekly demand has been moderate and stable (weeks after the early 2019 spike average ~40\u201365). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple (1+L)=3 weeks of demand. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 in earlier evidence; promised lead time is 2. To keep orders conservative given a large in-transit position but adapt to the recent steady regime, use default lead time (promised=2) and recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the most recent ~20 weeks of realized demand and dampen influence of the early spike. This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost (large pipeline already present).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical demand shows an earlier large upward regime in Feb\u2013Mar but the last many weeks (Periods 36\u201345) show much lower steady weekly demand (~29\u201363). Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded evidence confirmed LT=2. Pipeline (383) already comfortably covers multiple weeks of recent demand. Set L to default (use promised LT=2). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 36\u201345). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. With profit=holding, service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock \u2248 mu_hat; recent-based mu/sigma keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service for current low-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weekly demand has been moderate (mostly 18\u201397 after the large Jan spike); on-hand=0, in-transit=383 (sufficient pipeline). Observed lead times have varied (1 and 2 periods). I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the backend infer actual mean lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L): this keeps orders conservative given the sizable in-transit inventory and avoids overstock while preserving service given uncertain lead-time behavior.
