Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "History shows highly variable actual lead times (observed W=1\u20133) and past lost/delayed shipments, so we remain cautious. Current state: on-hand=0 but in-transit=457 units (large pipeline). Recent demand spikes (Periods 31\u201336 and 45\u201346) are real, but the pipeline (457) already materially exceeds a multi-period demand forecast (even using elevated recent means). Placing additional order now risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) that reduces reward more than marginal incremental profit ($4/unit) given long/uncertain lead times. OR recommended 0 units; I accept that recommendation because pipeline coverage is ample and lead-time uncertainty argues against topping up. Therefore order 0 to avoid overstock and large holding costs while awaiting confirmation of arrivals in subsequent conclude messages.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Accepted OR's 0: large in-transit pipeline (457 units) already covers upcoming demand despite past lead-time variability; avoid extra ordering to prevent costly holding.",
