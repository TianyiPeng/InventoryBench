Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show rising demand (0,0,11,17,38) but only 5 points and insufficient sustained evidence for a regime change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to cover the review+lead horizon (3 periods) while avoiding overcommitment given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show low-to-moderate weekly demand (samples: 0,0,11,17,38). On-hand=0, in-transit=39 (order placed Period 1) but arrival not yet confirmed in any conclude message, so do not assume lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Choose default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which yields a modest replenishment level covering the review+lead period while keeping holding cost sensitivity equal to profit (profit=holding cost). This balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent observed demand (P1=54, P2=100) is well above historical sample mean (0,0,11,17,38), but there are only two high-demand periods \u2014 not enough to declare a sustained regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=60 (orders from P1/P2), and those arrivals have not concluded (possible delay/loss), so keep promised lead time assumption. Choose L=default to retain promised 2-period lead time while awaiting concluded arrivals. Use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to bias the forecast toward recent higher demand without overfitting two points. Keep sigma_hat=default (use all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) because volatility evidence is limited. These settings raise expected target stock to respond to the recent spike while preserving conservative lead-time handling given unconfirmed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand is high and rising (Period1-3 demands = 54, 100, 113). All three recent orders (P1:39, P2:21, P3:130) have concluded as arrived=0 despite promised L=2, indicating shipments are delayed or lost for multiple periods. Conservative response: increase assumed lead time to avoid underordering, and size forecast from the last 3 demand observations which reflect the new higher regime. Chosen methods: L explicit=3 to hedge against observed multi-period delays (one period longer than promised); mu_hat recent_N N=3 to base (1+L)-period demand on the three most recent high-demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service given missing inflows while keeping sigma based on recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (39, 21, 130) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude; evidence of sustained delivery delays or lost shipments over 3 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand regime is high (period demands: 54,100,113,88) vs older low seasonality (historic samples 0,0,11,17,38). On-hand=0, in-transit=309 (some earlier orders remain overdue but Period 2 order arrival confirms lead time behavior). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed average rather than default promised. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (use the four most recent realized demands) to capture the current higher-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. For volatility I also use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters prioritize meeting high current demand while the OR engine\u2019s cap will limit excessive orders given holding cost parity with profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=309. History shows large uptick in demand since early Feb (period demands: P1-5 = 54,100,113,88,56) and evidence of missing/delayed shipments earlier; one concluded arrival confirms lead time = 2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period lead). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) because a clear regime change began in Feb \u2014 using the last 5 periods (P1\u2013P5) captures the new higher mean while limiting dilution from older low-Jan samples. Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping variance estimate local to recent periods to avoid overstock from older low-demand data.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand has been high (Periods 1-6 demands: 54,100,113,88,56,71) versus earlier low historical samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=309 (several earlier orders outstanding). Observed concluded lead time evidence (Period 4 conclude: P2 order arrived P4) supports using observed lead-time average rather than default. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets reflect the last 6 periods of demand and recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent weekly demand has been volatile but elevated: last 4 observed demands (Periods 4-7) = [88,56,71,114], mean=82.25. On-hand=0, in-transit=309 (large pipeline; some earlier orders from Periods 1-3 failed to arrive but a Period 2 order confirmed lead_time=2). I retain lead time estimate based on observed arrivals (average observed = 2). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding cost), I target coverage for the (1+L) review+lead window using recent demand: set L by calculation from observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4-demand regime to react to current elevated/volatile demand while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap rule.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (~56\u2013114); last 6 periods (P3\u2013P8) avg demand = 91.5 units/week, so using a recent_N=6 forecast ((1+L)\xd7mean) captures current demand. On-hand 0 + in-transit 309 covers roughly 3 periods at this recent mean (309 \u2248 3\xd7103), so maintain promised lead time. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (2) while mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to respond to the regime shift and elevated variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime: last 6 periods demands = [88,56,71,114,107,122], mean=93. On-hand=0, in-transit=309 units (covers several future periods). Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) though earlier shipments were delayed/lost; no additional confirmed lead-time shifts. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed lead-time average (uses concluded arrivals) which reflects the confirmed 2-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 6 weeks). For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices focus ordering on the recent realized demand pattern while relying on concluded lead-time evidence; given heavy in-transit inventory, this avoids over-ordering while preserving service against the elevated recent demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=309. Historical conclues show one observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and multiple earlier missing/delayed arrivals; therefore use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. I choose L='calculate' (average of observed lead times = 2). Demand exhibits recent high weekly values but no sustained confirmed regime change (only 10 periods of demand with upward noise), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances using confirmed lead-time evidence while letting the backend use full-sample demand stats given limited sustained changepoint evidence; it also avoids overreacting to recent volatility while acknowledging in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weeks show sustained high demand (weeks 5\u201311: 56,71,114,107,122,133,164) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=309. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and earlier missing shipments were observed but no new confirmed lead-time change. I select L=default to trust promised lead time (2) as recently confirmed. Demand/volatility have elevated versus the very sparse early samples but no clear changepoint requiring truncation; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This also keeps policy responsive while the in-transit 309 provides buffer against immediate stockouts.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=309. Historical concludes confirm at least one actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4); multiple earlier orders (P1\u2013P3) were delayed but P2 arrival confirms promised = 2 is plausible. Demand has risen and stabilized in recent weeks (periods 8\u201312: 107,122,133,164,150). I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the latest higher-demand regime (avoids dilution by very early low values). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting elevated recent demand while recognizing in-transit stock; they help the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances service level (profit=holding cost so critical to cover demand) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/05/13. On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: one confirmed observation (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) -> lead time = 2. Several earlier orders remained missing for multiple periods but we have at least one confirmed LT=2, so use observed LT. Demand history shows sustained higher weekly demand since late Feb (many weeks >100); to capture full variability and current higher mean, use default demand estimates (all samples) with L set from observed data. These parameters keep the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time while letting it compute (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has shifted upwards recently; last 7 weeks (Periods 8\u201314) show consistently higher demand (107,122,133,164,150,118,122) so I use recent data to capture current regime. Set L by calculate (uses observed lead times) to reflect confirmed LT=2. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent sustained regime, balancing higher service need against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=406; earlier orders (P1-3) were missing but Period 4 confirmed a 2-period lead time. I keep L as promised (default=2) because observed conclues confirm lead time=2 and lost-shipment evidence is historical (no new sustained change). Recent demand (Periods 6-15) is substantially higher than the very early samples, indicating a regime shift to elevated weekly demand; to reflect current demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=10 (captures the last 10 concluded demands) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new higher mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock; keeping L=default avoids over-correcting for past missing shipments which are in-transit or lost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=406; historical conclude messages confirm at least one observed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and multiple missing/delayed arrivals earlier. To be conservative about lead time uncertainty but grounded in observed data, set L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). Demand has risen and recent periods (Periods 7\u201316) show consistently high weekly demand (~107\u2013164); use recent_N=10 to focus mu_hat and sigma_hat on this recent regime so the OR base-stock targets enough inventory to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand samples. Using recent_N for volatility captures current variability and avoids underestimating safety stock given past lost shipments.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 (matches outstanding orders from P1,P3,P4,P13). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Recent demand shows a higher, stable regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13-17) = [118,122,153,147,123], mean \u2248132.6. To target service while limiting holding cost given profit=holding ($1), I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 2) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances filling upcoming 3-period demand (review+lead) against holding costs and accounts for prior delayed shipments by using actual observed lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Historical demand shifted up after Period 3 (early Feb small samples then sustained ~56\u2013164 from Period 5\u201318). There is confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 2\u2192Period 4). Multiple orders remain missing but only one concluded lead-time observation exists, so use observed lead time average. I set L to calculate to let backend average observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 14 demand samples (Periods 5\u201318) to capture the new, higher-demand regime and avoid contamination from the very early low-demand weeks. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=14 to measure recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to serve the sustained higher demand while keeping volatility and lead-time estimation grounded in concluded evidence; they also help the OR engine offset late/lost shipments by sizing orders to recent demand and observed lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Promised L=2 and prior concluded evidence (Period 4 & 5) supports lead time ~2; however there were earlier missing shipments but current pipeline (406) is large vs recent demand. I choose L=default to let backend use promised lead time. Demand recently elevated and variable since Period 13 (118,122,153,147,123,82,127); I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the latest regime (7 most recent demand samples) so the forecast reflects current higher mean. For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=7) to capture recent volatility. These choices lean the base-stock toward meeting current observed demand while using recent variability to temper service-level z. They also avoid overreacting to earlier lost shipments because in-transit inventory is substantial.

Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained weeks of 100+ demand). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time=2. I use recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201320 \u2248 14 samples), so the OR backend will size base-stock to cover the current high-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large ongoing demand) against holding cost given zero on-hand and sizeable in-transit volume.

On-hand=0, in-transit=406 (pipeline sizable but several past orders were delayed/lost earlier\u2014monitoring but lead time was previously confirmed as 2). To capture the recent high-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent 10-week samples so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean; use recent 10-week volatility for sigma_hat. Keep L as default (promised lead time=2) so OR backend uses contractual lead time while we rely on recent demand stats to cover risk from past delays.

Recent demand (many consecutive weeks of nonzero demand, higher than early Jan samples) suggests using a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. I set L by calculate to use observed lead times (2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the latest 20 demand observations, which balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> z*=0). This helps the OR backend produce a base_stock aligned with recent demand while respecting pipeline.

There is evidence of earlier missing/delayed shipments but recent concluded data supports L=2. Demand history since Feb\u2013July shows sustained weekly demand mostly in the 80\u2013160 range. I use default methods so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages the full sample history while respecting the confirmed lead time and lets the capped ordering cap moderate order size given pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concludes show sustained missing arrivals earlier but lead time has a confirmed observation of 2 periods (Period 2\u2192Period 4). Given no new concluded evidence of changed lead time and many demand samples across periods, use promised/confirmed lead time and aggregate-demand defaults so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance over (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (use observed lead time=2) vs holding cost by not inflating forecasts based on unsettled/possibly lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has been consistently ~80\u2013164 units (many weeks ~100\u2013150). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 \u2014 large pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks, but historical history shows past missing shipments; however Period 4 conclude confirmed a 2-period lead time for at least one order. Given no sustained, recent change in demand regime and the large in-transit balance, use the promised lead time and population-wide demand statistics so the OR backend applies its default base-stock calculation. This balances service (use existing pipeline) against holding cost by not inflating the forecast or safety stock absent strong evidence of a new regime or confirmed prolonged delays beyond already noted issues.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, In-transit=406 (these are outstanding orders from Periods 1,3,4,13: 39+130+140+97=406) \u2014 many shipments remain unarrived long past promised lead time. Concluded evidence shows one clear lead-time observation: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2. No sustained, multi-period confirmed shift above 2 (missing shipments likely lost/delayed rather than a new stable lead-time). I therefore set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed lead-time data (average observed = 2). Demand and volatility are set to 'default' so the backend uses the full sample history ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and large in-transit uncertainty.

Date 2019-08-19. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) despite earlier missing shipments; current on-hand=0, in-transit=406 (large pipeline). Given confirmed LT=2 and no recent sustained demand regime shift, use defaults so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This leverages full sample history while the large in-transit volume will cap ordering via the backend cap to avoid excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms L=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and earlier missing shipments were episodic; keep promised/default lead time. Use demand estimate based on the most recent stable regime (recent ~20 weeks of demand since March show consistent ~70\u2013150 weekly demand) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to capture current mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (covers ~L+1 periods of current weekly demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) so we avoid excessive safety stock while the large in-transit amount (406) already provides coverage.

Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concludes show earlier missing shipments (Periods 1-3) but Period 4/5 evidence confirmed actual lead time = 2 for at least one order. Given confirmed lead time and large in-transit quantity that likely covers (1+L) demand, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap from full sample history. This is conservative: defaults leverage all historical demand to balance service vs holding cost while avoiding over-adjusting for sporadic lost shipments.

To be conservative I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) and use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples for (1+L)-period demand and volatility. This avoids overfitting short recent noise while the large in-transit pipeline will be accounted for by the engine.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weekly demand has been low-to-moderate (last 10 weeks: 83\u219269\u219275\u219264\u219253\u219237) after earlier spring peaks. On-hand=0, in-transit=406 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but prior history shows multiple missing/delayed shipments (Periods 1-3) and one confirmed observed lead_time=2 (Period 2\u21924). Use calculated lead time to reflect observed arrivals (avg observed LT=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages full sample history while the calculated L makes the review+lead coverage explicit given the mixed arrival history. No change ordering beyond backend rules to avoid overreacting to potentially lost shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand has declined from summer peaks to ~53,37,29 over the last 3 weeks; on-hand=0, in-transit=406 (many prior orders delayed). Earlier concluded history confirmed lead time=2 and several lost/delayed shipments, but no new sustained regime change in demand beyond the recent downward trend. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (matches confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to place weight on the latest weeks and capture the recent downward regime while meeting the (1+L) coverage requirement. Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep targets responsive to the recent lower demand while the OR backend caps orders using its cap parameter to limit over-ordering against delayed pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes confirm at least one actual lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and many earlier missing arrivals but recent concludes show no new permanent shift. Demand has trended down in recent weeks (Period30-33: 53,37,29,45) \u2014 I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current lower-demand regime. I keep L as promised (default) because concluded evidence supports lead time=2 and no sustained change beyond that. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the latest regime (N=8 covers the most recent 8 demands), which reduces overstating demand and limits holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Several earlier orders (Periods1-3) failed to arrive and suggest past lost/delayed shipments but no new sustained pattern since Period 5 confirmation. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 2-period lead time). For demand forecasting use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages full history while the calculated L accounts for realized lead time and the large in-transit volume (406) will be balanced by the backend's capped ordering logic to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14. Recent demand has fallen sharply since early Sep (Periods 30-35: 53,37,29,45,24,16) \u2014 a sustained lower-demand regime of ~6 weeks. Concluded lead-time evidence (Period 4 conclude) confirms lead time = 2 historically; no new arrivals contradict that. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand (N=6) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the most recent consistent samples. L set via 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to reflect confirmed lead time=2. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given holding cost equals profit.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, In-transit=406. History shows earlier missing shipments but lead time was confirmed as 2 periods; current pipeline is large (406) so avoid inflating forecasts. Recent weekly demand has trended down since early Sep (Periods ~30+). I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N to capture the recent lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering; N=8 (last 8 weeks) captures the post-September decline. I use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward lower base-stock and lower cap given the large in-transit, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service for recent demand levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-10-28. On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Concluded history shows lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and no sustained new lead-time shift; several earlier shipments were delayed but most recent evidence supports promised lead time. Demand has trended down through Sep\u2013Oct; I use a recent-sample forecast to reflect the lower recent weekly demand (reduce risk of overstock given profit=holding cost). Set L=default so backend uses promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 (captures the most recent ~3 months of weekly demand to reflect the current lower regime). This balances service vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand and observed variability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods earlier; promised lead time = 2, so use default L. Demand has declined since mid-year; recent regime (Periods 30-38) shows consistently lower weekly demand (range ~12\u201353, recent 9 periods mostly 12\u201345). I choose recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): recent demand has fallen to low weekly levels (Periods 30-39 average low teens). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 \u2014 several earlier orders failed to conclude (Periods 1-3) indicating lost/delayed shipments, but concluded evidence shows actual observed lead_time=2 (Period 2\u2192Period 4). To be conservative I use computed average lead time (calculate) so backend uses observed lead times; for demand I focus on the recent low-demand regime (last 10 weeks) using recent_N N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and volatility. This keeps base-stock aligned to current weak demand while the lead-time estimate reflects confirmed observations, reducing risk of over-ordering given possible missing arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Recent weekly demand has fallen to low levels (last months mainly single- to low-double digits). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 units \u2014 sufficient to cover (1+L)=3 periods at current low demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm promised lead time of 2 earlier; no new sustained lead-time change. To adapt to the clear downward demand regime, keep L as default (promised=2) and use recent_N for demand estimates so the OR engine bases replenishment on the most recent low-demand weeks. I choose N=20 to capture the recent seasonal/regime drop while smoothing short noise; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service while avoiding excess holding cost given Profit=Holding, so we prioritize tighter, recent-based forecasts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-11-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (orders from P2 arrived in P4) and multiple earlier missing shipments were observed but a large pipeline now exists. Demand has trended down through Nov (recent weeks low). To avoid overfitting to short recent volatility while respecting confirmed lead time and the large pipeline, use default lead time (promised 2) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full history. This keeps ordering conservative given equal profit and holding cost and lets the capped policy limit order quantity against the current in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Promised lead time=2. Recent weekly demand has trended much lower since late summer; using a recent-window forecast best captures current regime. I choose L=default to trust promised LT (OR engine expects promised LT=2) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 20 weeks of demand (captures the downward seasonal regime and current volatility). With in-transit=406 and (1+L)=3, pipeline covers several weeks of demand; the chosen parameters will let the backend compute a base-stock aligned to current demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 (many older orders outstanding; historical conclude messages show at least one confirmed lead time=2). Recent demand has fallen substantially vs. spring/summer peak (last ~10 weeks: low teens). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed lead_time=2 (use average of observed concludes). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (this yields a smaller mu_hat so orders won't overstock given holding cost = profit). Sigma set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding holding cost from large overdue pipeline while still provisioning for near-term low demand.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and earlier multi-period missing shipments were observed but current pipeline is large. To avoid over-reacting to past lost shipments while letting the OR engine use its promised-lead-time model, I keep L at the promised default and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (given substantial in-transit units) against holding cost and avoids artificially inflating forecasts from transient missing-shipment noise.

Pipeline (406) substantially exceeds typical (1+L)-period demand, so use default estimators to let OR engine apply its historical statistics with promised lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand (Periods ~27-46) is much lower than early-year peaks; historical concluded lead-time evidence shows L=2 is confirmed. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time, I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts over (1+L) periods using the most recent 20 demand samples. L uses default (promised) = 2 which matches concluded evidence. This reduces excess inventory risk while keeping service for current demand levels.
