Historical demand shows a regime shift: recent 3-period average \u224862.3 units/week (carry-over insight). Requirement: order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

OR recommends 125 using promised lead time and historical data. Decision: do not place a new order (order=0). Rationale: current pipeline (187) roughly equals expected demand over the decision-relevant horizon (3 periods), so additional ordering risks increased holding cost if pipeline arrives. Given evidence of delayed/lost arrivals, placing more now risks adding to in-transit that may also be delayed/lost; better to wait one period to observe whether the existing 187 arrives before committing more. Final strategy vs OR: override OR's capped recommendation of 125 down to 0 because pipeline already covers the (L+1)-period demand estimate and because of suspected shipment delays/losses \u2014 we prioritize avoiding excess holding cost and clarifying lead-time through observation.",
