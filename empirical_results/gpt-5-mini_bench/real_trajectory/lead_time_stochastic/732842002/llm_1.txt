Demand analysis: recent stabilized low-demand regime \u2014 last 4 observed weekly demands (P41\u2013P44) = 33, 62, 23, 31 \u2192 avg \u224837/wk. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2; historical actual LT varies 1\u20133 and some shipments were lost earlier, but current system shows In-transit=700. Inventory decision: with (L+1)=3 periods of exposure, expected demand \u22483\xd737\u2248111 units. Carrying cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit) favors avoiding excess stock since large in-transit position (700) likely covers near-term demand even if partially delayed. Action: place no new order this period to avoid high holding cost and to observe whether in-transit shipments conclude.",
