Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand shows a clear rising trend (6,13,32,49,62) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0 with no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. No sustained evidence of lost shipments or lead-time shift. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so the OR backend captures the observed rising mean across all samples while keeping volatility estimate broad.

On-hand=0, in-transit=72 (ordered in P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot confirm actual lead time. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: set L to default (promised=2) so backend accounts for review+lead horizon; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to provide a stable forecast and service-level calculation given limited history, while avoiding overreacting to a single recent high demand period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=141 (orders from P1+P2). Orders placed in P1 should arrive during Period 3 arrival resolution but arrivals are only visible in Period 4 conclude\u2014cannot conclude lead time or lost shipments yet. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show a clear upward trend; use recent_N for mu_hat to capture this regime. Keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded arrivals do not yet contradict the promise. Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). These choices raise the target base stock to cover the recent higher demand while avoiding premature lead-time adjustments given insufficient arrival confirmations. 

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand trend 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04: demand rose from 6 to 62 (+933%); 5-period mean=32.4 (5 samples).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 Period 4. Demand history shows a sustained upward regime (5-sample mean=32.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=223 (many outstanding orders). Three consecutive 'Period conclude' messages show orders placed in Periods 1-3 with arrived=0 (ordered:72,69,82) \u2014 shipments overdue vs promised lead time=2. To avoid stockouts given rising demand and likely longer actual lead time, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility to capture the recent upward regime (5 available samples). These choices raise target base_stock to cover an extra period of delayed arrivals while using recent data to reflect higher demand, balancing service level against holding cost (holding cost is low $1 vs profit $19 so favor higher service).

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears longer than promised: orders placed P1-P3 (72,69,82) all arrived=0 by their expected arrival -> evidence actual lead time >=3 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime (5-sample mean=32.4). On-hand=39, in-transit=194. Orders from P1 and P3 remain missing but P2 arrived in P4 (ordered P2 -> arrived P4, lead_time=2). Given the confirmed observed lead_time=2 and the clear upward demand, use calculated lead time from observations and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean across the full sample set and default volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) while avoiding overreaction to possibly lost individual shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order placed on Period 2 arrived on Period 4, observed lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows a sustained upward demand regime (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04; 5-sample mean=32.4) and lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). On-hand=2, in-transit=194. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 2-period lead time. For demand I choose mu_hat=default so the backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) which captures the elevated recent mean while scaling for review+lead period. sigma_hat=default lets the backend compute sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed variability. These conservative defaults leverage the confirmed lead time and the clear upward demand trend while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise or risking undersupply given large in-transit volume.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=194. Historical base (2019-01-07..02-04) mean=32.4 but recent realized customer demand over the last 6 weeks (Periods 1-6) is higher: [38,73,52,30,37,39], mean=44.83. Lead time was confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). I keep L at the default (promised=2) because conclude messages confirm LT=2. To capture the recent, sustained higher demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; this raises target base-stock to meet current demand while the large in-transit pipeline (194) prevents immediate stockouts. This balances service (using recent demand) vs holding cost by relying on confirmed LT and recent demand-driven \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 rather than older low-January samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent 6-period mean=44.83 vs prior 5-sample mean=32.4 (+38%), sustained over 6 weeks (Periods 1-6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has shifted up and stabilized: Periods 1-6 weekly demand = [38,73,52,30,37,39], 6-period mean=44.83. On-hand=0, in-transit=194 (covers ~3 periods of demand: (1+L)*mean \u2248 134.5). Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (observed: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). I set L via calculate to let the backend confirm observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances raising the base-stock to meet higher demand while relying on ample in-transit inventory to limit extra ordering and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=194 which covers multiple future periods. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (Period 4 showed P2 order arrived with lead_time=2) and recent sustained demand uplift (recent 6-period mean=44.83 vs prior 5-sample mean=32.4, +38%). To reflect the sustained higher demand regime I set L to default (promised=2) and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, capturing the new regime while the large in-transit pipeline prevents immediate stockouts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (recent 6-period mean ~44.83 vs earlier 32.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=194 (sizable pipeline arriving per confirmed lead time). Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed P2->P4). To reflect the recent sustained higher demand, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the 6-period elevated regime). Use default lead time (promised 2, consistent with observed confirmations). Use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while sigma reflects recent variability; using recent samples balances service-level needs vs low holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=194. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 periods (P2\u2192P4). Recent demand has shifted up (recent 6-period mean elevated vs earlier mean). To capture the recent higher demand, set L to promised/default (2), use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 6 observations, and use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level from increased demand while keeping holding cost in mind given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=194. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4). Demand has been higher recently (Periods 6-11 mean \u224850.2 vs earlier 5-sample mean 32.4), indicating a sustained upward regime since ~Period 7. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (confirmed=2) and use recent_N forecasting to capture the new higher-demand regime: use the last 6 periods to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the elevated demand while the capped order cap limits excessive single-period buys and holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 Period 13. On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead time includes confirmed 2-period arrival (P2\u2192P4), so use promised/default lead time=2. Recent demand shows a higher regime; use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 7\u201312 demands: 24,38,31,76,93,53; mean=52.5) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=3*52.5 to cover review+lead demand. Use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while capping orders (backend cap applies) to limit excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=235. Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows actual lead time =2 (P2\u2192arrived P4), so use observed lead-time averaging. Demand has sustained higher regime since early periods (recent 6-period mean \u224844.8 vs prior mean \u224832.4); use recent_N=6 to capture the elevated demand for the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility. The large in-transit pipeline plus elevated recent demand argues for forecasting based on recent samples so OR backend sets base stock to cover the higher demand while cap limits excessive ordering.

Demand has shifted upward vs initial 5-sample baseline; recent sustained higher demand (recent 6-period mean ~44.8 per prior insight). To balance service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost $1, I set L by averaging observed lead times and use recent 6-period demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current higher-demand regime while limiting excess inventory given long pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=236. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 periods (orders: P2->P4, P12->P14), so I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times. Demand has stayed in a higher regime since early periods; recent 6-period demand (Periods 10-15 = 76,93,53,39,39,38) shows mean=56.33, so I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current elevated demand and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These parameters aim to raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding exposure limited by using only recent data. I flag no overdue/lost shipments now (in-transit=236 likely covers upcoming arrivals given observed lead time=2).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand has stepped up and become volatile (recent high weeks: 76,93,86). On-hand=0, in-transit=236 which provides pipeline cover but may not arrive until promised lead time. I use L=default (promised 2) because concluded history repeatedly shows 2-period arrivals; no strong evidence to override. For demand I focus on the recent regime: use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and higher variance over the last 6 demand observations, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=209. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (multiple orders: P2->P4, P12->P14, P15->P17). Demand has shifted upward recently (notably large spikes in Periods 16-17). To reflect the recent higher demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 12-17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the elevated mean and volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded messages corroborate LT=2. The in-transit 209 units provides coverage across (1+L) periods vs expected demand; the recent_N-based base stock will let the OR backend increase target stock to balance the high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has shifted up (recent 6-period mean ~44.83 vs earlier 32.4). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods (consistent: P2\u2192P4, P12\u2192P14, P15\u2192P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=374 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed lead time and the recent higher demand regime I set L to a calculated value (avg observed lead times =2). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 so variability is estimated from the same recent window. These settings prioritize matching replenishment to the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit quantity will be accounted for by the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=271. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead_times: 2,2,2,1 over the last 4 concluded arrivals), so I use a recent average to capture current variability. Demand has shifted sharply upward in recent weeks (Periods 15-19: demands = 38,86,180,141,187; 5-period mean=126.4) versus earlier regime (~44.83). To make the OR backend responsive to the recent high-demand regime while accounting for variable lead time and pipeline, I set: L via recent_N on the last 4 observed lead times; mu_hat via recent_N on the last 5 demand samples (captures the new high-demand level across the review+lead period); sigma_hat via recent_N on the last 5 samples to reflect increased volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to serve the current higher demand while the recent_N lead-time estimate helps avoid under-ordering if lead time shortens; using recent demand/volatility avoids being anchored to much lower early-season means.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg demand increased from prior recent avg 44.83 to 126.4 (+182%), sustained over P17-P19 (3+ periods).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=503 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2,2,2,1 (avg 1.75). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 17-20). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to capture volatility in this recent high regime. These choices bias stock towards meeting the new higher demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to prevent excessive new orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand remains on the higher regime established at Period 17 (periods 17-22 demands = 180,141,187,147,167,103; recent 6-mean \u2248154). On-hand=129 + in-transit=326 gives substantial pipeline cover, but promised lead time=2 has occasionally produced 1-period arrivals; concluded lead times mostly 2 in recent history. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses measured average (captures occasional 1-period arrival). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 17; sigma_hat also recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility and observed lead time to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime (recent 6-week mean ~137 units/week) after the jump in mid-June. On-hand=108, in-transit=367 gives ample coverage vs (1+L) review+lead demand. Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,2,1,2,2] \u2192 average ~1.83; use calculate so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=6 to capture the elevated regime (reduces dilution from earlier low-demand weeks). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) so uncertainty reflects recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tuned to the new, sustained higher demand while recognizing observed lead-time behavior and the current large pipeline to avoid overordering and excess holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Recent demand remains elevated vs early-periods (recent 5 demands: 147,167,103,76,188 \u2192 mean=136.2) and a sustained regime shift was observed around Period 17. Recent arrivals consistently show lead time \u22482 in concluded history. I keep L at promised (default) but use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility so mu_hat reflects the high recent mean over the review+lead horizon and sigma_hat captures recent variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (Periods 17-25 shows sustained large weekly demand ~100-187). On-hand=0, in-transit=540 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,2,1,2,2} (avg ~1.83). To reflect observed variability I set L by 'calculate' (uses observed average). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (focus on most recent 6 demand observations) so the OR engine targets a base-stock aligned with the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand remains high vs early periods\u2014last 5 demands (P22-P26) = [103,76,188,107,78], recent mean=110.4. Concluded lead times are variable but recent 5 observed lead times (most recent arrivals) average ~2. To balance service (high recent demand) vs low holding cost, I use recent data window of 5 for demand mean/volatility and a recent-5 average for lead time so the OR backend increases base stock to meet elevated demand while capturing recent lead-time variability. This also guards against intermittent delayed arrivals by using recent observations rather than all-time averages.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime that began around Period 17 (sustained high weekly sales P17\u2013P27). Lead times in concluded history vary (observed W = 2 mostly, occasional 1 and 3); use average observed lead time to capture this variability. To keep the forecast focused on the current high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent history (last 11 concluded demand samples, P17\u2013P27). This ensures the OR engine builds base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while L=calculate lets the backend average observed lead times (mitigating occasional 1\u20133 period swings). On-hand=59 and in-transit=324 provide ample pipeline coverage; these parameters avoid overreacting to short delays or single lost shipments while maintaining service during sustained high demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed values: 2,2,2,1,2,2,3,2...) so I let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Recent demand has been elevated vs early history; last 7 concluded demand samples (P22\u2013P28 = 103,76,188,107,78,79,65) average ~99.4. I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7) so mu_hat reflects the current higher regime across the review+lead period. Volatility has also increased, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=7) to capture current std. These choices balance service level (capture higher recent mean and observed LT variability) while keeping holding cost penalty in mind given substantial in-transit inventory (466 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=466. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times but average \u22482 over last 5 arrivals (lead_times: 2,3,2,2,1) so I set L by recent_N=5. Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime; last 6 demands (Periods 24-29) average ~96.3, so I forecast using recent 6-sample mean for review+lead (mu_hat recent_N N=6). Volatility also reflects the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=6). These choices align the OR base-stock calculation to recent demand and observed lead-time behavior while the large in-transit stock will limit orders via the backend cap.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=80, in-transit=324. Historical concluded lead times average 2.0 (observed arrivals show mostly 2-period fills with occasional 1\u20133). Demand has been elevated vs early history; recent weeks (last ~6 periods) show moderate-high demand. I set L by calculate to use the average of observed lead times (2). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher recent demand regime while limiting influence of early low-demand weeks. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for recent demand levels (raising service) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost=$1/unit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=324. Historical concluded lead times (most recent observed): [2,2,3,2,1,2] \u2192 evidence of variable LT averaging 2. Demand recent 6-periods (Periods 26-31) = [78,79,65,61,62,107], recent mean \u224875.33; demand regime elevated vs early-sample, and prior large spike (Periods 17-19) is already recorded. To be robust to observed LT variability and recent demand, I set L using recent_N (N=6) to capture recent actual lead time behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, limiting over/under-ordering given in-transit inventory and occasional delayed shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent observed lead times (from concluded messages) average 2.0 periods (samples: 2,2,2,1,2,2,3,2,2) so I set L by calculate to reflect observed reality rather than promised blind default. Demand has been elevated since the regime shift around Period 17 but shows variability; to capture the current operating regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7 demand observations (Periods 26-32) to adapt to current mean/volatility while avoiding overreaction to a single spike. This balances service (higher mu_hat reflecting elevated recent demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from our recent volatility estimate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=324. Recent demand has been elevated vs early history; recent 6-week mean ~75.3. Lead-time observations in concludes show variability but recent realized lead_times = [1,2,2,3,2,2] (Periods 19,22,23,26,27,30) => average \u22482. I select L by averaging the last 6 observed lead times to capture recent variability while downweighting early anomalies. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use the most recent 6 demand samples (Periods 28-33) so the (1+L) aggregation reflects the current higher-demand regime. This balances service (using recent higher mean) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline; using recent_N avoids overreacting to older low-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=324 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times cluster at 2 periods (with occasional 1 or 3); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 29-36) shows a lower, stable regime (~62 units/week mean); to focus the forecast on the latest regime I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers the most recent 8 demand observations: P29-P36). This keeps target inventory (1+L periods) aligned to current demand while the large in-transit position reduces need for aggressive ordering.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand (Periods 32-37) averaged ~55 units/week with moderate variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=324 which already covers multiple weeks of demand. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average ~2.0 periods, so use calculated average lead time. To keep forecast responsive to the recent regime and current weekly pattern, I use a recent_N demand estimate based on the last 6 weeks (Periods 32-37). Sigma is also estimated from the same 6-week window to capture current variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate to recent demand while recognizing substantial pipeline stock, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): recent weekly demand has settled lower than mid-year peaks\u2014last 6 concluded demands (Periods 33-38) average ~49.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=324 (sizable pipeline). Observed historical actual lead times vary (1\u20133) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the most recent demand regime I use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the last 6 weeks rather than the inflated mid-year peak. This balances service (using recent demand mean) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=324. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but centered lead times (observed lead_times = [2,2,2,1,2,2,3,2,2], avg=2.0). Demand history shows multiple regime shifts earlier; no new sustained demand change since Period 20 insight. Given confirmed average lead time =2 and no new recent demand changepoint, I set L by calculation (use observed average). For demand and volatility I use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which leverages full history and the computed lead time. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost while not overreacting to short-term noise or isolated delayed arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=344. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1\u20133; average lead time used to align ordering cadence and because promised=2. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201340) averages ~51.6/week with moderate variability; use recent_N=10 to capture the current demand regime and variance while avoiding older high-volatility spikes. These choices (calculate L; recent_N for mu and sigma) give the OR backend a forecast tuned to the latest observed demand and realistic lead-time estimate so orders plus pipeline will cover (1+L) periods of demand without excessive holding given low holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=344. Recent weekly demand (Periods 36-41) = [35,63,41,21,15,32], recent 6-week mean \u2248 34.5, which is materially lower than the mid-year spike regime and appears to be the current demand regime. Concluded history shows mixed lead-time observations (1\u20133) but no new sustained shift since earlier confirmations; use promised lead time. To keep pipeline aligned with the current lower-demand regime while protecting service, set L to default (promised = 2). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (N=6 chosen because a clear recent regime of ~6 weeks is visible and N is within allowable bounds). This focuses the OR backend on satisfying (1+L) periods of the recently observed lower demand, reducing excess holding given holding cost=1 and unit profit=19.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods, average \u22482.1) and recent weekly demand has moderated (last 5 demands: 21,15,32,27,12). To hedge lead-time variability use the backend's calculated average lead time (calculate). To reflect the recent lower/seasonal demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples (recent_N, N=5) so the base-stock and safety stock focus on current demand behavior while the calculated L captures observed lead-time drift; this balances service vs holding given high pipeline inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=324. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed lead_times = [2,2,2,1,2,2,3,2,2,3], avg \u22482.1) so I use the calculated average lead time rather than trusting a single promised value. Recent demand (last 6 concluded periods: P39-P44 = 21,15,32,27,12,12) is much lower than earlier peaks, so I forecast using the recent 6-sample mean and recent volatility to capture the current low-demand regime. These choices keep the OR backend's base_stock responsive to the lowered demand while the calculated lead time accounts for modest variability around the promised 2 periods and helps avoid overstock given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=324 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no on-hand stock for immediate demand. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed avg \u22482.11 periods) so I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the observed-average lead time. Demand has fallen recently (last 7 weeks mean \u224819 units/week) compared with earlier regimes, so I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime. These settings aim to match actual lead-time experience while limiting overstocks given low recent demand; high profit/low holding cost implies a high service target, but recent demand reduction argues for a conservative, recent-data-based forecast.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand (Periods 41-46) is low/moderate (32,27,12,12,20,16; recent mean \u224819.8) after mid-year spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=324 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary historically (1\u20133); use calculated average lead time to let backend incorporate all concluded lead-time observations. For demand I choose recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 6 weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to avoid overstock despite large in-transit volume while maintaining service for current demand levels.
