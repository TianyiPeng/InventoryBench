Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples through 2019-02-04) shows no sustained regime change; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need coverage for review+lead periods. Promised lead time is 2 and no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). This gives the OR engine a stable baseline (covers (L+1) periods of expected demand) while avoiding premature adjustments given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). No concluded arrivals yet for the Period 1 order (ordered=161, arrived=0 in P1 conclude) so there is no evidence lead time has changed or shipments lost. Use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples: [126,120,128,113,161] (mean=129.6). With promised L=2, default forecasting (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) balances service vs holding given profit $19 and holding $1. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=161 covers some future demand but arrival will only be visible after promised lead time; defaults keep parameters aligned with backend assumptions while avoiding overreacting to a single non-arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples (historical seed) show mean ~129.6 units/week (samples: 126,120,128,113,161). On-hand=0, in-transit=347 \u2014 pipeline currently large relative to typical weekly demand. Both Period1 and Period2 orders (161,186) have not concluded yet; this is an early sign of delayed arrivals but not a sustained lead-time change (only 2 missing conclusions). I therefore keep L at the promised default to avoid overreacting to potential transient delays. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) \u2014 this leverages the available demand seed while the large in-transit position will cap orders via the pipeline subtraction and the engine's cap. This balances service (meeting expected demand) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and uncertain lead-time evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): on-hand=0, in-transit=489, historical weekly demand samples mean=129.6. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded as arrived by Period 4 conclude, suggesting actual lead time is longer than promised 2 or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 4 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, reflecting the longer review+lead horizon and preserving statistical stability given limited data. This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts given missing arrivals while acknowledging holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained missing arrivals: orders placed P1(161), P2(186), P3(142) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude \u2192 evidence of lead time >2 or lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1694.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history: P2 order (186) arrived in Period 4 => observed lead_time=2. On-hand=92, in-transit=481 (pipeline large vs on-hand). P1 and P3 orders remain unconfirmed (possible lost/delayed) but we have at least one confirmed lead-time=2. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (reflects confirmed 2-period lead time). For demand I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples (stable 5-sample history: 126,120,128,113,161). This balances service (use confirmed L=2) while keeping demand forecast conservative given limited data and some missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4: ordered=186, arrived=186; observed lead_time=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has fallen steadily across Periods 1-5 (186,134,111,94,82) and on-hand is low (10) with large in-transit (481). Period 4/5 conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 and previous late arrivals resolved; therefore use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent downward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses Periods 1-5 demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and vol; this avoids overstocking while accounting for current variability and the large pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent weekly demand history average = 129.6 units; product is non-seasonal basic denim jeggings. On-hand=0, in-transit=481 (multiple past orders outstanding; Periods 1-3 orders were delayed but Period 2 arrival confirmed lead_time=2). Given confirmed lead time=2 and no sustained demand regime change, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates to let the OR engine apply its base-stock formula. This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) against holding cost while acknowledging some past shipments may have been lost/delayed (we do not change L without additional concluded lead-time samples).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: Period 4 conclude shows an arrival for order placed in P2 with lead_time=2; earlier missing arrivals indicate possible lost/delayed shipments but a confirmed observation supports L\u22482. Recent demand (most recent 5 periods: 111,94,82,97,258) shows elevated variability with one large spike (258) but not a sustained new regime; use a recent_N demand estimate to capture short-run shifts while avoiding overreacting to a single spike. Set L by 'calculate' (use observed lead times average). Set mu_hat as recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand pattern over the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat as recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices provide the OR backend with updated lead-time estimate and a short-window forecast that balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=594. Recent demand volatile (weekly sales: 186,134,111,94,82,97,258,174) with a single large spike (258) but otherwise lower levels. Promised LT=2 was recently confirmed (Period2 order arrived in Period4 -> LT=2). Use lead time averaging to lock in LT=2. To balance service vs holding given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, use an EWMA demand forecast (gamma=0.5) to emphasize recent weeks while smoothing the 258 spike; keep sigma at default to reflect full-sample variability. This setup aims to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while avoiding overreaction to the single spike. No new lost-shipment signal beyond earlier resolved evidence.

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=663. History shows one confirmed observed lead time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4) and earlier missing arrivals; use average observed lead time to reflect confirmed 2. Demand has recently increased with volatile peaks (last 5 demands = 82,97,258,174,104; mean=143), so use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture current regime. These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N=5, sigma_hat recent_N=5) let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scaled std to balance service level vs holding cost given the high in-transit volume and recent demand spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has risen sharply (periods 6-10 demands = 97,258,174,104,89) indicating a higher recent mean than earlier samples. On-hand=93, in-transit=481 (pipeline strong). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 in multiple instances (e.g., P2->P4, P8->P10). I will use the promised/default lead time to keep alignment with supplier promise, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (uses last 5 demand observations). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while sigma from recent volatility supports safety stock; this balances higher service level during the demand uptick against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=546. Historical concluded lead-time observations: orders with observed lead_times = 2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P8\u2192P10), 1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2014 average ~1.67. Given mixed but majority-2 observations and promised lead time=2, use calculated average lead time to let backend blend observed variability. Demand history shows no new sustained regime shift; use default demand mean/volatility scaled by (1+L) so backend computes base_stock and cap consistently. This balances service (captures observed ~2-period delays) versus holding cost by letting OR engine set safety stock from data-driven mu/sigma.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=546 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {2,2,1} (avg \u22481.67) and earlier missing arrivals appear resolved; therefore set L by calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time. Demand sample history (five weekly samples mean=129.6) shows no sustained new regime (sporadic spikes but not 3+ periods), so use default demand/volatility which lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This yields a base_stock that accounts for the estimated lead time while the large in-transit volume will cap orders via the OR cap, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=481. Recent concluded history shows arrivals consistent with promised lead time=2 (multiple P->P+2 arrivals), and earlier missing arrivals appear resolved. To let the OR engine use full sample history and the promised lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent volatility, I select default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use full-data mean) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 2019/5/20. On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals give observed lead_times = {2,2,1,2} (avg=1.75) with most observations at 2. To reflect actual observed variability while letting OR backend use promised-L logic, set L by calculate (average observed). Demand forecast and volatility use all historical samples (no clear sustained demand regime shift): use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat, letting backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This balances service (capture ~L\u22482 behavior) vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Pipeline is large (509) so avoid overstating demand; use averaged observed lead time to capture mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. Set L using calculated average of observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses (1+L)*historical mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level (profit>>holding cost) against holding cost given large pipeline and some lost/delayed signals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2 (multiple periods) and occasional 1; overall evidence supports using the average observed lead time rather than the promised value to capture variability and possible delayed shipments. I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to leverage all historical weekly demand data given limited sustained regime shifts; sigma uses default to reflect overall observed volatility. These choices balance service (account for longer/mixed lead times) and holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base_stock and cap using overall demand stats.

On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (pipeline large enough to cover future demand). Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand stats so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance over review+lead period; this balances service level given large pipeline while avoiding extra safety stock from short-lived demand blips.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent weekly demand samples show high variability (historic samples 126,120,128,113,161 plus subsequent observed demands up to 258 then varied weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 \u2014 substantial pipeline available but several earlier orders were delayed before (evidence of intermittent late arrivals). Period-conclude messages show observed lead times of 2,2,1,2 \u2192 average ~1.75. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical average lead time to reflect observed variability and to use default demand moments (all samples) so the OR engine builds base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full history. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time ~2 periods (multiple P2/P8/P11 observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (large pipeline). Demand has declined recently; last 5 demands = [128,132,66,81,44], so use a recent window to capture current lower demand. Set L by calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime, limiting overstock while preserving service given sizable in-transit pipeline.

Concluded lead-time observations: 2,2,1,2 \u2192 average 1.75. Because we have multiple concluded lead-time observations, set L to the calculated average to reflect realized lead-time behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a baseline that balances service level (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline.

Recent observed demand has been low and variable (Periods 17-21: 66,81,44,29,34) after earlier peaks; prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 2. Pipeline (509) is large relative to recent weekly demand, so use default lead time and aggregate-demand estimates letting OR backend compute base stock and cap from full sample history. This avoids overfitting to recent volatility while preventing unnecessary additional ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrival observed in Period 4). Several earlier delayed orders were resolved, so I will use the promised/confirmed lead time. Use default demand estimates so the OR backend applies full historical mean/variance (no strong, sustained demand regime change detected). This keeps ordering aligned with long-run mean while the large in-transit pipeline (509) prevents aggressive new orders and limits holding cost risk.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in multiple episodes; no sustained evidence of longer lead time now. Demand has moved to a lower regime starting Period 17 (see carry-over). To avoid overstocking given much lower recent demand, keep L as default (promised=2) but base forecast on recent demand. Set mu_hat using recent_N of the last 7 periods (Period 17-23) to capture the new lower mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service for current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg demand before P17 = 129.9 units (Periods 1-16), recent avg Periods 17-23 = 49.1 units (\u221262%), sustained for 7 periods.

To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and nonzero in-transit, set lead-time estimate from observed history and forecast demand from the recent low-demand regime. Chosen: L=calculate to reflect averaged observed lead times (evidence: multiple concluded orders with LT=2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to base (1+L)-period demand on the 8-period low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201324), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock to match the lower demand and limits holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline covers near-term demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 17 (avg ~49.1) for 9+ periods; lead time observations repeatedly show 2 periods (confirmed at Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating demand forecast from old high-demand samples. Set L to use promised lead time (2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime to capture the sustained drop: N=9 (Periods 17-25). This keeps the (1+L)\xd7mean demand low to avoid excess ending inventory given high pipeline and low holding cost sensitivity (profit $19 vs hold $1).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 17 (avg ~49.1) vs prior ~129.9. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default L=2. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=509 units \u2014 pipeline is already very large relative to recent demand, so forecast should be driven by the recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the last 10 periods (Periods 17\u201326), which captures the sustained lower regime while smoothing short noise. This keeps orders modest given high pipeline, balancing high service target (q\u22480.95) against holding cost and avoids over-ordering against the current low-demand environment.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (multiple orders: P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10, P11\u2192P13). Demand has a sustained downward regime starting Period 17 (recent lower demand). To align ordering with the lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding given low holding cost ($1) but finite profit, use the promised lead time and compute demand forecast from the recent post-change samples. Set L to promised (2) so OR backend uses correct review+lead horizon; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 (Periods 17\u201327) to capture the new lower mean and recent volatility, improving service while limiting overstock given the large in-transit quantity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 17 (avg Periods 17-23 = 49.1; sustained 7+ periods and continuing through P28). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded arrivals support LT=2; use default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with supplier promise. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 17-28) to capture the new low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=12 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock sized to current lower demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces need for aggressive ordering, balancing service vs holding costs.

Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2} (avg ~1.75) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (recent low-demand regime). To avoid overstocking given the ~62% drop since P17, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend infers ~1.75; set demand forecasts using the recent low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201329) with N=13 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower mean and volatility and keep orders conservative relative to earlier high-demand periods. This balances service level against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Promised lead time remains 2; no sustained new lead-time evidence. Set L=default to keep backend assumption of promised LT=2. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201330, length=14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained drop and reduce excess ordering given the large in-transit quantity. This balances service vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff and prevents overstocking against the 509 units already inbound.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical conclues show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (mean before P17 \u2248129.9 \u2192 recent mean \u224849.1, sustained 7+ periods). Lead-time observations include multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals and one 1-period arrival; some earlier orders were delayed but later concluded. To reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime and recent lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and I set demand parameters using recent data after the changepoint. Specifically: L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times; mu_hat="recent_N" with N=15 to use periods 17\u201331 (the post-shift regime) for (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=15 to capture post-shift volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand while letting the backend account for service-level tradeoffs; using recent samples also avoids overstock from pre-shift high demand. The policy also recognizes the sizeable in-transit stock (509) when computing final order.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand since Period 17 dropped from historical avg ~129.9 (P1-16) to a new lower regime; last 16 periods (P17-32) avg \u2248 67.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 \u2014 pipeline already large relative to (1+L)\xd7recent demand. Promised lead time=2 has been confirmed previously; no new sustained lead-time shift. I set L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (use the most recent 16-sample regime average and volatility). This keeps the backend forecast focused on the new lower mean while letting the large in-transit buffer prevent excessive ordering.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded lead times confirm promised L=2 (observed P2\u2192P4). Demand sharply shifted down starting Period 17 (avg P1-16=129.9 vs avg P17-33\u224849.1) and this low regime has persisted through Period 33 (17 periods). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals match L=2 and there is no new evidence of further lead-time drift. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 17 samples). For volatility I use recent_N N=17 to reflect recent variability. These parameters focus orders on the new lower-demand regime, avoid overstock given holding cost $1 vs profit $19, and let the backend compute safety stock based on profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical data shows an earlier sustained demand drop (Periods 17\u201323) but more recent weeks (Periods 30\u201334) are volatile with high spikes; lead time has been confirmed as 2 in earlier conclude messages. Given large in-transit pipeline and unclear persistent recent regime change, use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies full-sample statistics and the capped order cap will limit excessive ordering despite pipeline. This avoids overreacting to recent volatility while acknowledging confirmed L=2 in history.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded lead times observed are predominantly 2 periods (several P?_to_P? concludes show lead_time=2, occasional 1). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 17: recent lower-demand regime spans Periods 17\u201335. Therefore: set L by averaging observed concluded lead times (calculate) to let backend capture the empirical lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the post-change regime (Periods 17\u201335) to reflect the sustained lower mean and volatility (N=19 chosen as regime_length capped at 20). This balances service level (matches observed lead time) and reduces forecasted demand/holding given the persistent drop in demand; it also avoids over-ordering against a large in-transit backlog.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: 509 units currently in-transit with no recent conclude confirmations (sustained lack of arrivals observed in recent periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 with sustained missing/undelivered confirmations in recent periods; prior concludes confirm actual lead time=2 in earlier windows but many shipments remain unconfirmed. I keep L=default (use promised 2) because concluded lead-time observations are mixed and backend expects promised LT; to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime since Period 17 I use recent_N for demand (N=20 covering Periods 17-36) so mu_hat reflects the recent ~20-period lower mean. I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility including a few spikes. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower demand while relying on the promised lead time the OR engine expects, helping avoid excess holding given large in-transit volume and $1 holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=509 with history showing earlier lead times centered on 2 periods (no sustained, conclusive shift beyond promised). Recent demand (Periods 29-37) average \u2248145 units/week with high variability and several large spikes (266, 233). To balance service level vs holding cost: keep L as default (promised 2), set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the latest higher-demand regime (N=9 covers Periods 29-37), and set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N to reflect current volatility so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately while capping orders via its cap rule.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=614 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times have repeatedly been 2 (confirmed) so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been nonstationary with a low-demand regime from P17\u2013P23 (~49 avg) but large volatile spikes recently (P33\u2013P38: 266,143,125,81,233,234). To capture the most recent demand regime and volatility, I use recent_N over the last 8 samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher/volatile weekly demand while L stays as promised to let OR engine plan for the two-period arrival window. This balances service (keeping pipeline coverage) against holding cost given many units already in-transit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=691. Historical concludes show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.75) but there have been sustained missing arrivals earlier and large in-transit volume; demand regime dropped starting Period 17 (sustained lower demand). To be conservative on lead time inference use calculate (backend avg of observed lead times). For demand, use recent_N reflecting the post-change regime (Periods 17+): choose N=20 to capture the most recent 20 weeks of demand for (1+L)-period forecast. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward recent lower demand while letting the backend compute lead-time-adjusted safety stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=691 (many past missing arrivals flagged). Concluded history shows actual confirmed lead_time=2 (no sustained evidence to override promised lead time). Demand regime shifted down starting Period 17 (recent lower-demand regime); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=20 (regime length >20, cap at 20). L kept as promised to match concluded evidence and avoid over-correcting for missing shipments. recent_N choices for mu_hat and sigma_hat focus the OR base-stock on the recent lower mean and volatility, reducing excess ordering while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=614. Historical concludes show actual lead time commonly 2 (Period 2\u21924, Period 39\u219241); promised lead time=2 is appropriate. Demand since Period 33 shows a return to higher and volatile weekly demand (Periods 34-41: 143,125,81,233,234,145,127,103) after the low-demand regime earlier (P17-23). To capture the recent higher/volatile regime while the lead time remains 2, I use a recent-N forecast over the most recent 8 weeks (Periods 34-41). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent elevated demand and volatility so the OR backend raises base stock to avoid stockouts during promised lead time while capping order size via the backend cap to limit excess holding costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2-period arrivals with a single 1-period outlier; average observed lead-time ~1.8 \u2192 use calculated average to let backend infer actual recent mean lead time. Demand shows variability and recent spikes (e.g. P42=371) \u2014 use recent_N to capture current demand regime and volatility using the last 20 samples so forecasts reflect latest pattern rather than long-ago winter/spring averages. This balances service (capture recent higher demand/volatility) against holding cost by using recent data rather than inflating with long-term historical means.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=636. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 in multiple periods but there have been intermittent missing/delayed arrivals; demand shows a prior sustained low regime (P17-P23) but subsequent volatility with intermittent spikes. Given mixed recent demand and confirmed lead time=2, use the promised/default estimators so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance with L=promised to produce a balanced base-stock vs holding-cost tradeoff while accounting for pipeline inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16): on-hand=0, in-transit=636. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2-period arrivals (several P?_to_? events) with occasional 1-period; some shipments previously delayed/lost. Demand history shows a sustained lower regime since P17 (mean ~49) but with intermittent spikes (e.g., holiday weeks). To balance service and holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1, use calculated lead time (captures observed average, robust to occasional 1-period arrivals) and let backend compute base-stock and caps from full-sample stats: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This leverages all data while allowing the OR engine to target the profit-weighted service level; explicit shorter/longer L would risk over/under-stocking given mixed arrival evidence and large in-transit volume.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=614. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior observations; promised lead time is 2. Demand shows elevated late-Nov/Dec spikes (Periods 42 and 45 large). To capture the recent holiday demand pattern while relying on confirmed lead time, set L to default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 weeks (captures recent spike and variance). This provides a short-term responsive forecast to raise base stock for holiday demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety buffer for variability; the OR backend will then compute z* from profit/holding to balance service level vs holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 4,10,13,41,45) consistently show actual lead time = 2; earlier missing arrivals occurred but recent confirmations re-establish L=2. Demand shows no new sustained regime shift since last recorded insight. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised operations and recent evidence, use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit volume and confirmed LT=2.
