OR used all samples to produce 354 (matches OR's cap computation: single-period mean \u2248118.2, cap \u2248353). Why adjust: OR equally weights old zero-demand weeks; recent two weeks (216,319) show a materially higher regime (recent mean=267.5/week). Using recent mean as a short-term anchor gives \u03bc\u0302=(1+L)*267.5=802.5 over the 3-period review+lead.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history shows actual lead time \u22482 (Period2\u21924, Period30\u219232, Period39\u219241) with occasional 1\u20133 variation and a known lost shipment (Period1, 436 units) already recorded. Current visible state: on-hand=0, in-transit=791 units. Demand outlook: recent confirmed regime shifts show a large autumn spike (Periods 30\u201336) followed by a drop; most recent weeks (Periods 43\u201344) demand = 30 and 54, consistent with the low-demand regime observed earlier (Periods 15\u201329). OR recommends 0 units using promised L and historical data. Decision: follow OR and order 0. Reasoning: the substantial in-transit quantity (791) is sufficient to cover several upcoming weeks even if some arrivals are delayed or some in-transit are lost; placing new orders risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit per unit ($19) does not justify stocking ahead given current low observed demand and lead-time uncertainty. Operationally, monitor concluded arrivals over the next 2\u20133 periods to confirm how much of the 791 actually arrives (to detect additional losses or delays); only if concluded arrivals are much lower than expected or demand rises sustainably should we increase ordering.
