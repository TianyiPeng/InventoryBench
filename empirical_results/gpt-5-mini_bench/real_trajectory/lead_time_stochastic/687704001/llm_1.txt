Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is week of 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) \u2014 apparel demand can spike short-term. Demand analysis: recent weeks demand = Periods 42\u201345: 227, 30, 54, 59 (volatile; single large spike at P42 not sustained). On-hand+pipeline: on-hand=278, in-transit=1602 => total supply=1880 units, which materially exceeds plausible one- to two-week demand even with a holiday uplift. Lead time / reliability: lead time has been variable historically (1\u20133 periods observed) but recent order (P43\u2192P45) arrived with LT=2, so some in-transit likely to arrive soon; treat in-transit as available for planning but remain conservative on future orders. Inventory cost tradeoff: Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 with large pipeline, ordering risks large holding cost with limited upside. Action: place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost and use existing pipeline to meet potential holiday demand.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, typically depressed demand for apparel early Jan). Product: women's denim\u2014seasonal but no immediate calendar spike expected now. Demand analysis: recent concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) average \u224851/week (30,54,59,60) \u2014 substantially below earlier spikes; previous carry-over already notes recent lower-demand regime. Lead time & pipeline: history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) but recent orders have been arriving; current system reports In-transit=1602 units. Inventory assessment: On-hand=218 plus large in-transit (1602) gives ample coverage for multiple weeks even under higher-demand scenarios; holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit \u2014 avoid unnecessary holding. Risk: some historical lost shipments occurred early, but recent deliveries have been consistent; nevertheless pipeline quantity is large enough that we need not replenish. Action: place no order to avoid incurring holding cost while meeting demand from existing stock.",
