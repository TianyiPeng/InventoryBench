Product: womens blouse (seasonal gift/holiday purchases) \u2014 expect at least baseline weekly demand with possible uplift. Demand history (recent concluded weeks): P45=193, P44 sold constrained to 133 (stockout), P43=177 \u2014 baseline ~180/week; occasional spikes (P42=722 earlier). Pipeline reliability: prior carry-over notes show many long-delayed/lost shipments; in-transit=4001 should be treated as unreliable unless confirmed by a conclude. Inventory math: on-hand=407 only reliable stock. With promised lead time=2, decision must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Using a conservative forecast of ~200 units/week (allowing modest holiday uplift) => 3-period coverage \u2248600 units. Subtract reliable on-hand 407 => order \u2248193. Round to a safe, simple quantity given integer constraints and profit vs holding ($4 vs $1): order 200 units to protect service while limiting exposure to lost shipments and holding cost.",
