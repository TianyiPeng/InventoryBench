Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed. Historical weekly samples (5): [172,178,181,109,165] show no sustained regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This respects high service (profit/total=0.8) while avoiding speculative explicit adjustments given limited data and no shipment evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=210 (ordered in Period 1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 (no concluded arrivals yet). Promised lead time=2 and no evidence to revise it. Use default demand estimates based on full historical samples (2019-01 weekly data) scaled by (1+L) to cover review+lead period; keep default volatility. This keeps the OR backend anchored to historical mean/variance while covering 3 periods of demand given promised L=2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=414 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet for P1 (would appear in P3 conclude) so cannot confirm lead-time change or lost shipments. Historical sample mean=161 units/week (5 samples). I use default lead time to keep the model aligned with contract (L=promised=2). Demand forecast uses default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to reflect full review+lead coverage and avoid overreacting to two periods of zero on-hand sales caused by unseen arrivals. Volatility set to default to reflect historical variability across the full sample. These settings prioritize service (meeting expected demand across the 3-period window) while the OR backend will cap orders to limit overordering given pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) = [143,194,156] (mean=164.33). All orders placed in P1-P3 (total 532 units in-transit) have not concluded by Period 4, which indicates actual lead time is longer than the promised 2 periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to account for observed multi-period delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (current month demand ~164/wk) and scale by (1+L). Volatility also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability. These choices raise the inventory target to protect service given delayed arrivals while using only 3 recent samples to avoid overweighting older Jan samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended: orders from Periods 1-3 (total 532 units) remain unarrived by Period 4, implying actual lead time >=3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $521.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concludes show Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2, but orders from Periods 1-3 (total 532 units) remained unarrived by Period4, indicating extended/unstable lead time and potential lost/delayed shipments. On-hand=59, in-transit=498. To be conservative against missing arrivals I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover slower arrivals. Demand history mean =161/week; using (1+L)=4 gives mu_hat=644 to cover four-period demand. Sigma left to backend default (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) so variability scales with chosen L. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given delayed arrivals while accepting higher holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended to >=3 periods: orders from Periods 1-3 (total 532 units) remained unarrived by Period 4, indicating slowed or lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=628. Concluded history shows one confirmed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Earlier orders were delayed, but evidence is not yet a sustained change across 3+ consecutive concluded periods. I therefore use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period observation) and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) versus holding cost given uncertain delayed arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6); earlier orders showed delayed/uncertain arrivals and in-transit=498 vs on-hand=12, so lead time is variable. I choose L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (captures recent 2 and 1). For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given limited data and variable arrivals. This balances service (by increasing effective review+lead coverage via calculated L) against holding cost while acknowledging possible lost/slow shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=498 (matches outstanding orders: P1=210, P3=118, P4=170), showing sustained shipment delays. Observed concluded lead times: P2\u21922, P5\u21921, but multiple earlier orders remain unarrived \u2192 actual lead time appears longer than promised. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative against delayed/lost shipments. Base demand samples mean = 161 (samples:172,178,181,109,165). With (1+L)=4, mu_hat = 4 * 161 = 644 (explicit) to cover review+lead demand. Sample std \u224826.57; sigma_hat = sqrt(4)*26.57 \u2248 53.14 (explicit) to reflect observed volatility and extend safety stock under longer lead times. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service level given overdue pipeline while balancing holding cost by not overshooting beyond observed demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as >=3 periods: orders from Periods 1,3,4 (total 498 units) remain in-transit as of Period 8, indicating sustained delayed shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=689; recent arrivals show inconsistent lead times and many past orders delayed, so explicitly assume longer lead time to cover delayed shipments. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed >=3-period delays (Periods 1-3 orders still in-transit). For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 (captures latest 5 demand observations 145,117,118,105,203) to adapt to recent variability and the late spike; sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This increases pipeline-covering base_stock while keeping variability estimate responsive, balancing service level vs holding cost given high in-transit and delayed arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=689; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2) and multiple overdue/lost shipments in earlier periods. I treat lead time as explicitly longer to hedge against delayed shipments and preserve service. Demand has shifted recently (periods 5\u20139: 117,118,105,203,135) so I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to capture the current regime. With L explicit=3, (1+L)=4 covering review+lead horizon and reducing stockouts versus using promised L=2. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility (including the 203 spike).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=109, in-transit=498 (large pipeline; several prior orders delayed but some have concluded with LT=1\u20132). Demand recent week series (Periods 6\u201310) = [118,105,203,135,82], recent mean \u2248128.6. I keep L as default (promised 2) because only concluded messages support LT=1\u20132; missing arrivals are unresolved and the backend expects promised LT. To align supply with the most recent demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the last 5 demand periods and reduce bias from earlier data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward recent demand while relying on the promised lead time the OR engine expects, helping balance service level (capture recent demand spikes) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=13, in-transit=498. Historical concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) = 2, P6 (order P5) = 1, P10 (order P8) = 2 \u2192 recent average ~1.67. Demand historical samples (5 weeks) used as baseline. Given three observed lead-time samples, set L to calculated average to let backend adjust (reduces overordering vs assuming >=3). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level from elevated pipeline while avoiding excess holding cost on current visible in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time average \u22481.67 periods (observed: P4 arrival from P2 lead_time=2; P6 arrival from P5 lead_time=1; P10 arrival from P8 lead_time=2).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=498. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P10) -> average \u22481.67. Several past shipments were delayed but recent evidence indicates lead time ~1.7 rather than promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given moderate lead-time reduction and existing large in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=498. History shows inconsistent but frequently extended lead times (many orders unarrived through Periods 4-8) and confirmed arrivals with lead times 1\u20132 later (avg \u22481.67 at Period12). Given large outstanding in-transit volume and prior multi-period delays, I choose a conservative explicit lead-time estimate of 3 periods to ensure pipeline coverage. Demand historical mean across provided samples = 161 units/week; with (1+L)=4 this implies mu_hat = 644 units for the review+lead period, so I supply that explicitly. Volatility: population std of samples \u224826.57, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 gives sigma_hat \u224853.14, provided explicitly. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to cover the extended/uncertain pipeline while keeping sigma moderate to avoid excessive cap inflation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=689. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P4:2 (ordered P2), P6:1 (ordered P5), P10:2 (ordered P8)} \u2192 average observed lead time \u22481.67. There is a history of prolonged delays earlier, but recent concluded arrivals support a shorter average than the promised 2. I select L via "calculate" so the backend uses the empirical average lead time (captures mixed 1\u20132 period realizations). Demand forecasting uses dataset-wide defaults: mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative given limited sample set and avoids overreacting to intermittent outages. These settings aim to replenish pipeline to cover (1+L) periods of demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to control inventory given holding cost (Profit=$4, Holding=$1).

Use L.method="calculate" to let backend set L to the average observed lead time. Demand shows no sustained regime change vs historical samples, so use mu_hat.method="default" ((1+L)*mean of all samples) and sigma_hat.method="default" (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). These choices align the OR base-stock computation with observed lead-time evidence while avoiding overreacting to recent noise; they balance service (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2} \u2192 average \u22481.67, so use calculated average lead time rather than promised 2. Demand has declined from spring peak; recent 5-week demand (Periods 13-17 = 104,113,81,74,67) averages ~88. To keep the base-stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for shorter observed lead-time, use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. This balances service (covers (1+L) review+lead demand) vs holding cost by shrinking forecasts to recent demand levels and using observed lead-time estimate.

Given observed lead-time variability use calculated average lead time. Use recent demand (last 4 periods) to adapt mu_hat and sigma_hat to the lower current demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=689 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 showed 2 (order P2), P6 showed 1 (order P5), P10 showed 2 (order P8) \u2192 average \u22481.67. Recent demand has declined from ~100+ to ~50s over Periods 13\u201319; I therefore forecast using the recent regime to avoid overstocking the large in-transit pipeline. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect realized supply speed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7, Periods 13\u201319) to capture the lower recent mean and volatility; this reduces ordering compared with using all-sample averages and mitigates holding cost given current pipeline.

To reflect observed realized lead times I let the backend compute the average observed LT (method=calculate). For demand mean/variance I use the backend defaults (all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat = default, allowing (1+L) scaling consistent with the chosen L while leveraging full sample history and avoiding overfitting to recent noisy zero-inventory periods. This balances service level (capture observed LT) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Many earlier shipments were delayed but recent concluded evidence supports a shorter effective lead time than prolonged outages. To balance service vs holding cost, set L to be estimated from observed lead times (backend will average observed values). Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) and default sigma to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using full sample stats; this avoids overfitting to recent zero-sales weeks while accounting for estimated lead time. This keeps target inventory sufficient to cover (1+L) periods of demand given current in-transit pipeline while controlling holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times are mixed (observed arrivals: P4 from P2 LT=2; P6 from P5 LT=1; P10 from P8 LT=2) with prior periods showing long outstanding in-transit volumes\u2014so use a data-driven average lead time. Recent demand has been lower and more stable than the early high peaks (recent 5 periods show a lower regime), so compute forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current lower-demand regime. These choices (calculate L from observed lead times; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5) steer the OR backend toward a base-stock sized for the current lower demand while reflecting the empirical lead-time behavior and avoiding excess holding cost given Holding=$1 and Profit=$4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=689. History shows multiple prolonged delivery delays (periods 1-8 evidence) and then sparse arrivals; recent many periods with no arrivals despite large in-transit, so shipment delays/loss risk persists. To be conservative I set lead time explicit=3 to cover observed extended delays. Use default demand forecast and volatility so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to historical sample mean while the larger L raises coverage). This balances higher service level (covers delayed arrivals) against holding cost by relying on historical demand rather than inflating demand estimate.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 2 (P8\u2192P10)} \u2192 avg \u22481.67. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=689 (large pipeline but arrivals have been intermittent). I set L to "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1.67 signal from concluded arrivals). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to "default" so the backend computes demand over the (1+L) review+lead window using all historical samples (stable historical mean/variance from provided samples) \u2014 this balances service level against holding cost while relying on observed lead-time evidence rather than optimistic promised lead time. This approach is conservative about lost/delayed shipments because L is inferred from concluded arrivals rather than the promised value.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=689. Historical conclude messages show intermittent arrivals with several long delays and periods where many orders remained unarrived (evidence of shipments delayed >=3 periods earlier, though some later arrivals had lead_time 1\u20132). Given large in-transit volume (689) and persistent uncertainty about actual lead time, I conservatively set L explicitly to 3 to cover delayed arrivals and avoid stockouts during the review+lead period. Demand has been drifting lower since spring; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current lower regime using the most recent 10 demand observations (stabilizes estimate without over-weighting older high-demand weeks). I match sigma_hat to recent variability (last 10 periods) to reflect current volatilities and avoid overstating safety stock. These choices bias toward service (prevent lost sales from delayed supply) while keeping holding exposure limited by using recent demand stats rather than the long-run higher mean.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=689. Historical concluded lead times (observed arrivals) average \u22481.67 (observed lead_times: 2,1,2), so I use the backend's calculate method to let it set L from observed lead-time history. Demand history is mixed with many zero-stock periods but no clear, persistent recent regime shift; I therefore use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set. This balances service level (by using observed lead-time data) against holding cost (by not inflating demand estimates without stronger evidence).

LLM Rationale:

Lead-time history has mixed observations (some 1, some 2), so use calculated average lead time from observed conclues. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and higher recent variance, helping the OR backend size base-stock for near-term demand while avoiding excessive long-run holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Concluded lead-time observations: P4 (order P2) LT=2, P6 (order P5) LT=1, P10 (order P8) LT=2 \u2192 average observed LT \u22481.67. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of observed lead times. Demand and variability methods set to 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreacting to recent noise given many zero-arrival periods and uncertain lost shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=689. Concluded lead-time observations (P4,P6,P10) average \u22481.67; earlier multi-period delays were intermittent but later evidence points to shorter average. Recent demand shows a sharp spike at Period 33 (451) with elevated recent weekly means. To balance service vs holding cost: set L by calculating average observed lead times (uses concluded data); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the recent upward demand regime and increased volatility (N=5 covers Periods 29\u201333). This increases forecasted review+lead demand and reflects higher short-term variability while keeping parameters responsive to recent data. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments since concluded arrivals suggest average lead \u22481.67.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=825 units. Recent concluded lead-time observations: P4 (order P2) LT=2, P6 (order P5) LT=1, P10 (order P8) LT=2 \u2192 average \u22481.67. Demand shows a sustained uptick starting Period 31 (four high weeks). To capture actual lead-time behavior use calculated average lead time. To respond to the recent demand regime shift, forecast demand using the most recent 4 periods (Periods 31-34) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility, helping the OR backend raise the base stock while capping order size via its cap formula. This balances higher service level for the spike against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31: avg demand in Periods 31-34 = 269 units vs prior 4-period avg (P27-30)=95.25 (+183%).

History shows several delayed/variable arrivals but recent concluded lead times are 1\u20132 periods; use overall observed average to let backend smooth sporadic delays. Demand has a clear regime shift starting Period 31 with much higher weekly demand; use a recent_N forecast using the most recent 5 periods from the new regime to capture elevated mean/volatility. Methods chosen: L='calculate' to reflect average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; mu_hat='recent_N' (N=5) to target the new higher-demand regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and avoid understocking the spike while the OR engine applies service-level z*. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain arrivals.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 31 (periods 31-36 show substantially higher demand vs earlier history). On-hand=0, in-transit=825 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P10:2, P36:1} \u2192 average \u22481.5. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand forecast, I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 31\u201336) to capture the confirmed high-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent samples. For risk (sigma_hat) I use recent_N N=6 to reflect volatility in the new regime (not dilute with older low-demand periods). These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while relying on calculated L to reflect the faster observed arrivals; using recent samples reduces stockouts in the new regime while the large existing in-transit volume (825) will cap net ordering by the OR backend.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=880 \u2014 substantial pipeline but past history shows variable lead times and a sustained demand increase starting Period 31. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed concluded lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 (Periods 31\u201337) to anchor forecast to the new higher-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 so variability reflects the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed demand spike while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and the capped order quantity given observed lead-time evidence and pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=825. Historical concludes show mixed lead times (observed lead_times = 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg 1.4) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 31 (higher demand since P31). I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent faster-than-promised arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 31-38) because the carry-over insight documents a clear regime shift beginning Period 31; N=8 matches the recent high-demand regime length and yields (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples. For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the base-stock toward servicing the new, higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid overstocking given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=872. Recent concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods (observed leads: 2,1,2,1,1) so use average lead time inferred from observations. Demand shifted up starting Period 31 (sustained higher demand through Periods 31\u201339); base-stock should use recent demand to reflect the new regime and avoid stockouts. Set L to the calculated average of observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (N=9, Periods 31\u201339) so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the new higher mean and volatility while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 31 (much higher demand). I infer a shorter recent lead time than the promised 2 based on the last three observed arrivals (lead times = 2,1,1 \u2192 recent average ~1.33). To capture the recent high-demand regime, I base demand estimates on the most recent 10 demand samples. Choices: set L using recent_N to reflect observed recent lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the confirmed demand increase from Period 31 onward and avoid diluting with older low-demand data. This balances service (higher target stock for the new higher demand) while limiting excess holding by using a recent-window volatility estimate.

======================================================================

Recent concluded lead times (from history) are mixed but average shorter than earlier multi-period delays\u2014use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current realized mean. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 31; therefore forecast and volatility should be based on the recent high-demand regime (Periods 31-41). Parameters chosen: L by calculate to reflect observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 31-41) so base-stock and caps reflect the new higher demand while acknowledging current pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows volatile but elevated demand since Period 31 (regime shift) and a one-off extreme spike in Period 42 (722). On-hand=0, in-transit=825 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2] (most recent 6). I set L by averaging the last 6 observed lead times to capture the recent variability/delay pattern. For demand I use recent_N over the last 12 demand samples (covers the post-Period-31 higher-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility while avoiding overfitting to the single-period spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=1033. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed arrivals with lead_times mostly 1\u20132; prior prolonged delays occurred earlier). Recent demand since Period 31 is in a higher regime (sustained elevated weekly demand). I set L="calculate" so backend averages observed concluded lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20132 day leads while accounting for past variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 31\u201343 regime length \u224813) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 13 demand samples, which reflects the new high-demand regime and avoids dilution by older low-demand history. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=13 to capture volatility in the recent high-demand period. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff and the averaged lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 31 (many weeks with elevated demand including a 722 spike in P42); on-hand=0, in-transit=1033. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1,2} (avg ~1.5). To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. For demand I use recent_N=14 (the detected high-demand regime from P31\u2013P44, 14 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and volatility and avoid dilution by older low-demand data. This keeps base stock responsive to the new regime while the OR backend applies its capped ordering.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=15, in-transit=825. Recent concluded lead times show variability (observed W={2,1,2,1,1,2,2}, avg\u22481.57) so I let backend compute the empirical average lead time (calculate) rather than assume promised=2. Demand has shifted up since Period 31 (sustained higher weekly demand); to capture the new regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to weight recent high demand weeks (N=15 covers the post-changepoint window). Using recent data reduces stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals while avoiding excessive long-term holding cost by relying on empirical L and recent demand stats.

These choices (calculate L; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 covering Periods 31\u201346) let the OR engine size base-stock for the elevated demand while using recent variance to set safety stock, and they account for the observed shorter-than-promised effective lead times without overcommitting inventory given holding cost.
