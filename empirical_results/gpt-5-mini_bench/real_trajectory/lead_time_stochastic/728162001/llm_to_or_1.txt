Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples: [51,30,35,39,25], mean \u2248 36. No evidence of a sustained regime change or delayed arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend sets base-stock from full-sample mean and std.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=53 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples mean=36 units. Using default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead period and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std to reflect aggregated uncertainty. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=111. Historical weekly demand samples (early 2019) show mean \u224836.0/week. Two concluded periods show orders placed but zero arrivals \u2014 not yet enough to confirm lost shipments or a lead-time shift (promised L=2). I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting to two non-conclusions. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (using historical mean demand over review+lead window) against holding cost while respecting the pipeline (111 units) already in transit. If future conclude messages confirm delayed/lost arrivals, I'll escalate to an explicit/recent lead-time estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive orders (P1:53, P2:58, P3:29) with arrived=0 and in-transit=140 \u2192 strong evidence shipments are delayed/lost; therefore I set lead time explicitly longer to cover delayed arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to cover an extra period of delay. Demand historical samples (51,30,35,39,25) have mean 36; with (1+L)=4 this yields mu_hat explicit=144 to cover review+lead demand. I keep sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase pipeline cover to avoid stockouts given missing arrivals while letting the OR engine cap orders to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments observed P1-P3: ordered 53,58,29 with arrived=0 across three consecutive conclude messages; in-transit=140 suggests delayed or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $58.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=0, in-transit=86. History shows Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (ordered P2, arrived P4) so observed lead time evidence exists. Periods 1 and 3 orders did not conclude (suggesting lost/delayed shipments) but one confirmed arrival yields lead_time=2. I choose L by "calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed lead_time=2). Demand history (2019 weekly samples) is stable with mean ~36; I select mu_hat "default" to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, keeping the forecast conservative and leveraging full-sample stability. Volatility has no clear recent regime shift, so sigma_hat="default" (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices keep base-stock aligned with observed lead time while not overreacting to missing/one-off lost shipments, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=177. Historical concluded lead time evidence confirms L=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Recent demand has jumped (Periods 3-5: 83,121,270) suggesting a new high-demand regime; signal is recent but meets the minimum 3-period threshold for cautious adaptation. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the latest regime (captures periods 3-5). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the same window. These choices increase target base_stock to improve service during the apparent demand surge while keeping variance estimates aligned to recent volatility; this balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff given short lead time and observed demand spike.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has jumped (P4-6: 121,270,266) vs earlier samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 but history shows delayed/lost shipments P1-P3; arrivals observed with variable lead times (2 then 1). To balance service vs holding cost I estimate lead time from the two concluded lead-time observations (use recent average) and forecast demand from the most recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods) to cover review+lead demand; use recent volatility (last 3) for safety.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=657 but history shows mixed arrivals and several missing/delayed shipments earlier; confirmed observed lead times = {2,1}. To capture actual lead-time variability I use calculate (avg observed lead times). Demand has jumped recently (recent demands: 83,121,270,266,233) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new high-demand regime and higher variability. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the (review+lead) demand under current elevated demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and delayed arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 4 (demands: 121,270,266,233,136) versus much lower Jan samples\u2014use recent data. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8(P6):2, P8(P7):1} -> average lead time to-date = 1.5, so let backend calculate average from observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 4\u20138, 5 samples) to capture the elevated mean and volatility; N=5. Current on-hand 435 + in-transit 86 = 521 covers several periods, but recent high demand justifies sizing forecast from recent regime to balance service vs holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. SKU 728162001 on-hand=268, in-transit=181. Historical concluded lead-times show mix of 1 and 2 but prior insight confirmed lead time=2; there were earlier missing/delayed shipments but recent arrivals consistent. Profit and holding cost equal ($1 each) imply q=0.5 (service vs. cost balanced), so use default demand & uncertainty calculations and promised lead time to let the OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample stats. This avoids overreacting to transient delays and leverages all historical demand samples for stability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=168, in-transit=86; pipeline provides coverage but some earlier orders were delayed/lost. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time (captures the ~1.4 periods seen in concluded arrivals). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical demand samples (leveraging available sample mean=36) \u2014 this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) and the uncertain lead time, while avoiding overfitting to recent volatile large spikes.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has clearly shifted up from the January baseline (historical samples mean=36) \u2014 the last 9 concluded periods show much higher weekly demand (121,270,266,233,136,167,195,147,79). Observed lead times in concluded arrivals = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg=1.4). To reflect the confirmed higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 demand samples. For lead time, use a recent_N average of the last 5 observed lead times to capture the 1\u20132 period variability (avg ~1.4). These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping volatility estimated from recent data to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Historical concluded lead times: 2,1,2,1,1,2 \u2192 average ~1.5 periods; earlier missing arrivals (P1-P3) flagged but later concludes confirm mixed 1\u20132 period reality. Demand historical samples (2019 Jan) mean ~36/wk. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (captures mixture of 1\u20132 periods). For demand and volatility I use 'default' (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a conservative base-stock that balances service (accounting for longer observed avg lead time) versus holding cost while acknowledging past missing shipments via L inference.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Promised lead time=2; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times fluctuating 1\u20132 but no new sustained shift. On-hand=106, in-transit=280 (total pipeline=386) which covers several periods at current demand. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (2). Demand appears higher recently than the early 2019 samples, so I set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 demand observations) to capture the elevated regime (periods 11\u201315). I also set sigma_hat recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR engine raise base stock to meet higher recent demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock and avoid excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows actual lead times oscillating between 1\u20132 periods with confirmed 2-period instances; multiple earlier missing shipments were observed but recent arrivals resumed. Current inventory: on-hand=50, in-transit=280 (sufficient pipeline). Promised lead time is 2. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (2). Demand forecast and volatility will use all historical samples (mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history; this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while relying on the backend cap to limit overshoot given ample in-transit stock. This approach is conservative given resumed arrivals and avoids overreacting to transient spikes or missing-shipment noise.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10. On-hand=0, in-transit=280. Historical concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); some earlier missing shipments noted but recent concludes show arrivals with 1\u20132 period latency. To reflect observed variability I set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) so the backend infers the empirical lead time. Demand history is mixed without a clear sustained shift, so use default demand/statistics (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep the base-stock grounded in full history and avoid overreacting to recent noise. This balances service (captures observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given profit=holding, letting the OR engine compute safety stock via q=0.5.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=321 with several past missing/delayed arrivals (Periods 1-3 missing; later arrivals confirm lead times of 1\u20132). Recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 average ~1.67, so I use recent_N on the last 6 observed lead-times. Demand has shifted up recently (period demands last 5 observed: 50,60,56,116,151) \u2014 I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher recent mean and volatility. These choices raise the (1+L) demand forecast and estimated variability to increase target base-stock and protect service while avoiding excessive long-term holding since holding cost equals profit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has been elevated but no sustained 3+ period shift meeting significance, so use default demand sizing based on all samples to avoid overreacting. Using L='calculate' lets the OR engine average observed lead times (handles variability); mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' produce (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given mixed lead-time evidence and substantial in-transit inventory (280 units) that already covers multiple periods of demand.

Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (several outstanding arrivals; recent conclude history shows mixed lead times 1\u20132 periods with average ~1.5). Recent demand is elevated (last 5 demands: P16\u2013P20 = 56,116,151,140,98; mean \u2248112). To capture the recent higher demand regime while letting the OR backend infer lead time from observed data, set L using the average of observed lead times, and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to reflect the elevated mean/volatility. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of high demand) against holding cost by avoiding reliance on older low-demand samples.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent realized demand is much higher and more volatile than the small-Jan sample set (recent demands P17-P21 = 116,151,140,98,173; mean \u2248 136). Observed lead times in concluded history alternate 1\u20132 periods (several confirmed 2-period arrivals and several 1-period). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (use the last 5 concluded demand observations). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit = holding cost) while limiting excess holding by focusing on the most recent regime and using calculated lead time from observed arrivals.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=357 (sizable pipeline). Lead-time history contains both 1 and 2 period observations; use averaged observed lead time. To keep the OR engine responsive to the recent demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent sustained pattern and variance). These choices balance service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given a large pipeline: averaging recent demand raises the base stock to meet current high demand while using recent volatility keeps safety stock aligned with recent variability.

On-hand=0, in-transit=306 (pipeline present but past shipments showed delays/loss risk). Lead times observed historically are mixed (1 or 2); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use N=19 covering Periods 5\u201323). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated, sustained demand while letting the backend compute safety stock given estimated lead time and profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has jumped and remained high (multiple weeks of 200+ units in Periods 20-24, most recent demands: 140,98,173,227,221,246) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=447. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods; to let the backend infer the central tendency I use calculate for L. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to use recent_N with N=6 (covers the most recent 6 observed demand periods) so the base-stock and cap reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility and avoid understocking given the outstanding in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=553. Historical concludes show mixed actual lead times (1 and 2) but overall recent evidence supports an average lead time differing from the promised 2 at times; using calculated average lead time lets backend incorporate observed variability. Demand historical samples (provided) are limited to early 2019; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale by 1+L) to avoid overfitting to transient spikes. This balances service level (by using observed L) against holding cost (default safety stock from historical volatility).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=527 which is a large pipeline position. Observed concluded lead times vary (recent arrivals show 1,2 and a 3-period instance at Period 26), so I estimate a slightly above-promised lead time. I set L using recent_N (N=5) to average the last five observed lead times (captures the recent 3-period event plus other 1\u20132 period observations). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this leverages the full demand history while the adjusted L increases protection for delayed arrivals. This balances service (covering possible longer lead times) vs. holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=22, in-transit=421. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (1\u20133) but recent concludes cluster around 2; several earlier missing shipments noted but no new sustained loss pattern since Period 4\u20136 evidence. I choose to have the backend compute an empirical lead time average from observed concludes (method=calculate) so L reflects realized variability. For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level given profit=holding cost and leverages the full sample set rather than overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=421. Concluded arrivals show variable lead-times recently (1\u20133), with a recent cluster averaging ~2. To be responsive to the most recent dynamics and the apparent return to ~2-period lead time while capturing recent demand regime (higher weekly demand in Jul\u2013Aug), I use recent_N=5 for lead time and demand estimates. This uses the last 5 observed lead times (avg \u22482) and the last 5 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to cover the review+lead window and the empirical variability. This balances service (profit lost if stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) by targeting a moderate safety stock derived from recent volatility.

Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2; avg=1.69) and intermittent missing/delayed shipments earlier. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the observed-average (calculate) so the OR engine upsizes pipeline to cover occasional >2 delays. Demand estimates use default (all-sample) mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses full history for (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility, avoiding overreacting to single outliers while the calculated L accounts for delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent concluded arrivals show variable but recently centering around 2 periods (recent arrivals: W=3,2,2,1,2). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (large pipeline from prior orders); promised L=2. I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent realized lead-time regime (N=5 -> avg \u22482). Demand has been elevated in recent weeks (last 5 demands: 157,84,89,133,170; mean\u2248126.6). To match the short review+lead horizon and recent demand regime I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 (backend will compute (1+L)*mean). Volatility appears driven by recent weeks so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices align the base-stock to recent realized lead time and demand, while relying on the large existing in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (pipeline large but many past periods showed delayed/zero arrivals). Given mixed observed lead-times (1\u20133) and prior confirmation of a 2-period mode, let backend infer an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method: calculate). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed as (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all respectively \u2014 this leverages full history while letting L adjust the review+lead demand window. This balances service (raising base stock when average LT > promised) against holding cost using backend's profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 with history showing intermittent arrivals and past missing shipments; recent demand has been high (many 100+ weekly demands since Period 24). I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages (captures realized variability between 1\u20133). For demand I use recent_N N=8 to focus the (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime of elevated weekly demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings bias orders toward recent higher demand while letting the backend account for observed lead-time variability; they also avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples while acknowledging delayed/lost shipments via the L calculation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been low-moderate (last observed demands: ..., 46,49,10,90) but historically volatile with many zero-stock lost sales earlier in the year. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=421 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed concluded lead times \u22481.8. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded messages (captures variability instead of blindly using promised 2). Given large in-transit inventory and historical demand samples, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical data and lets the OR engine cap orders using its cap formula, avoiding extra ordering while pipeline is large. These choices balance service level (by reflecting empirical lead time) against holding cost (by not inflating demand forecast explicitly).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=0, in-transit=421. Recent demand (Periods 33-37) shows a lower, more stable regime vs earlier large spikes (demands: 140,46,49,90,83). Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded lead-times are mixed but no new sustained shift confirmed. To reflect recent demand levels and avoid overstock given high holding cost, set L to default (promised=2) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory based on the last 5 weeks of demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple weeks but history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and some lost/delayed shipments. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1\u20133 variability). Demand appears lower in recent weeks versus peak summer; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent 6 demands (periods 33\u201338) so base stock reflects current lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=421. Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms promised L=2. In-transit (421) already provides substantial pipeline covering (1+L) periods of demand; no recent sustained demand regime change identified from available samples. Use default lead time to respect supplier promise and let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat keep estimation stable and avoid overreacting to intermittent missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=421. Historical concluded messages show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and some delayed/lost shipments earlier; pipeline is large but uncertain. I choose L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given demand variability and large in-transit volume. This balances service level vs holding cost without overfitting recent noisy periods.

Use promised/default lead time to keep alignment with confirmed behavior. Demand shows a lower recent regime; I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 concluded demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current demand level and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead period.

Historical concluded lead-times frequently equal 2 and Period 5 previously confirmed lead_time=2; some earlier missing shipments noted but later arrivals confirm promised L=2. Pipeline (421) already covers multiple future periods of demand so keep modeling aligned with promised lead time. Use default L to trust promised lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full historical samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and large visible pipeline. No explicit adjustment made for missing shipments because arrivals since show L=2 is valid.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand history is variable but no new sustained regime change detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=421 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demands, so risk of holding cost is present. Past conclude messages (Periods 1-43) show actual lead times around 1-3 but promised lead time is 2; use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Use calculated L to capture realized lead-time average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent weekly demand has fallen versus mid-year peaks; last 5 demands = [64,134,25,14,21] showing low mean but high relative volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (pipeline large). Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Period 5) confirms actual LT \u2248 2; promised LT=2. To avoid overstocking given large pipeline and equal profit/holding ($1/$1) I keep L = promised (default) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current low-demand regime. I choose mu_hat recent_N (N=5) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This down-weights earlier high-summer demand and prevents ordering excessive stock while the large in-transit quantity is still expected to arrive.

Given large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time, use default lead time (promised) so backend assumes L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from available demand history; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting the OR engine cap orders based on pipeline.
