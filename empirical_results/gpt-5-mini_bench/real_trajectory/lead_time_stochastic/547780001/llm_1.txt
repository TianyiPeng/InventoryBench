Five-week average = ~75 units/week; the 121 value appears as an isolated high. Current regime estimate ~75/week. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 2 periods. No concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time; in-transit=0 and on-hand=0 so assume supplier will deliver per promise but treat uncertainty conservatively. d) Inventory assessment: Need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after ordering). 3 * 75 = 225 units to cover three weeks with no pipeline. Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs. profit $19/unit favors serving demand rather than stockouts. e) Order decision: Order 225 units to cover the current + next two periods (balances service and holding risk).",

Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we would normally replenish to avoid stockouts, however the sizable in-transit and evidence of lost shipments argues against placing additional orders now (to avoid excess holding cost if delayed shipments arrive).
