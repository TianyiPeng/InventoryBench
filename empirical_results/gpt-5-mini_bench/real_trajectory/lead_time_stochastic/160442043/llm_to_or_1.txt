Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; historical weekly demand sample mean = 35.6 (5 samples). Promised lead time used (default) because no observed lead-time evidence or lost shipments. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (order from P1 showed arrived=0 in P1 conclude). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand mean=35.6 (samples: 29,32,42,38,37). I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock target aligned with long-run demand and avoids overreacting to a single delayed arrival while covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly mean demand ~35.6 (samples 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). Recent concluded demands include a single large spike (114 in Period 2) but this is only one period of elevated demand\u2014insufficient to declare a regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=92 units; (1+promised L)=3 periods demand \u2248106.8, so pipeline currently below the coverage target. Promised lead time retained and demand estimates left to defaults so the OR backend will compute base_stock and capped order using full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This is conservative given limited evidence of a sustained demand shift and possible delayed/lost arrivals in history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=189. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean \u224835.6/week. No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (all arrived=0), so actual lead time cannot be confirmed from concluded messages. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std consistently with its model. This keeps the policy conservative given current in-transit stock while letting the backend cap orders appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (45, 47, 97) have not concluded as arrived by Period 4 despite promised L=2 \u2014 sustained 3-period absence suggests shipments are delayed or lost; treat actual lead time as uncertain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $893.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=190; one concluded arrival shows actual observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). However orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unconcluded suggesting some shipments delayed/lost; to be conservative use empirically observed lead time. Demand has clearly increased vs. older samples (recent demands: P1-P4 = 44,114,75,50) \u2014 a sustained higher regime across 4 periods. Therefore: set L by calculating average observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 demand periods to capture the new higher mean and volatility, so the OR backend raises base stock to improve service while capping order sizes per its cap constraint.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand has been volatile (recent concludes: 44,114,75,50,50) with no confirmed sustained downward shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 pipeline is large but contains delayed/unconfirmed arrivals (several orders not concluding); one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2. I choose L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals evidence) given mixed arrival behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 5 demand samples (captures the recent surge and subsequent drop without overreacting to a short 2-period dip). These choices balance service (capture recent higher variance) versus holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline and uncertain shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=48, in-transit=190. Recent conclude messages show mixed lead times: order on P2 arrived with LT=2 (arrived P4), order on P5 arrived with LT=1 (arrived P6) \u2192 recent average LT ~1.5. Several early orders (P1-P3) were delayed/missing but later partial arrivals observed; treat lead time as uncertain so use recent average of observed lead times. Demand has shifted above the older 5-sample baseline (historical mean ~35.6) \u2014 recent demand (Periods 2\u20136 = 114,75,50,50,65) average ~70.8, indicating a higher recent regime. To balance service level vs holding cost: set L based on the last 2 observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last 5 demand samples to reflect the elevated recent demand and volatility so the OR backend will size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while capping orders via its cap rule.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, In-transit=240. Historical concluded lead times: order on P2 arrived in P4 (LT=2); order on P5 arrived in P6 (LT=1) \u2192 recent observed LT average ~1.5. Recent demand history shows elevated weekly demand (concluded demands: 44,114,75,50,50,65,78) versus earlier sample mean 35.6. Many in-transit units exist but several earlier orders were delayed/lost, so I prefer letting backend compute an empirical L (calculate) from observed lead times. Use default demand/statistics (all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with chosen L; this balances higher service level from observed elevated demand while relying on the backend's capped ordering to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,1} (orders placed P2,P5,P7), suggesting actual L \u2248 1.33 vs promised 2; I'll use recent average of last 3 observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138 = 50,50,65,78,77) is materially higher than the older Jan samples, so forecast (1+L)\xd7mean should use recent demand: choose recent_N (N=5). Volatility likewise should reflect recent variability: use recent_N (N=5). Current on-hand 0 + in-transit 190 likely covers some future periods but contains delayed arrivals\u2014using recent short-window estimates keeps safety stock responsive while limiting holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times: P4 arrival (ordered P2) LT=2, P6 arrival (ordered P5) LT=1, P8 arrival (ordered P7) LT=1. On-hand=0, in-transit=232. Historical weekly demand samples mean=35.6 (samples: 29,32,42,38,37). Given mixed observed lead times, use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt L; use default demand/volatility aggregation so base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost while letting the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time average.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times across concluded arrivals: P4 (order P2) LT=2; P6 (order P5) LT=1; P8 (order P7) LT=1 \u2014 average observed lead time \u22481.33 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=200. Historical concluded lead times: P4(order P2)=2, P6(order P5)=1, P8(order P7)=1, P10(order P9)=1 => observed avg LT \u22481.25, showing faster-than-promised deliveries but earlier periods had multi-period absences so uncertainty exists. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures 1.25 signal). Demand has clearly shifted upward versus the Jan samples (recent weeks showing ~70s demand); use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect the recent high-demand regime ((1+L) scaling applied by backend). Volatility also appears elevated recently, so use recent_N N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect recent std. These choices bias orders toward higher service (capture increased demand) while letting backend compute safety stock from profit/holding cost tradeoff and observed lead-time average.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=271 (large pipeline). History shows concluded observed lead times of 2,1,1,1 \u2192 actual average shorter than promised but variable. Several earlier periods showed delayed/non-concluded arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders missing then later arrivals), so use backend's calculated average lead time (robust to mixed observations). Demand has recently stabilized higher than the early-sample mean (last 5 concluded demands: P7\u2013P11 = 78,77,77,78,65 \u2192 avg \u224875). To balance service vs holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the recent higher demand while sigma uses recent variation. This keeps orders responsive to the current higher-demand regime and avoids overreacting to older low-demand samples or transient missing shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=271 (multiple earlier orders outstanding; several earlier placements (P1-3) were delayed but recent concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period lead times). Recent demand has shifted up from historical Jan mean (~35.6) to ~65-78 in Periods 4-12. I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times so the backend will use the empirical average (captures recent LT \u22481\u20131.3). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201312). Sigma uses recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base_stock to cover the higher realized demand while letting the OR engine adjust safety stock for the empirically observed lead time; this balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent concluded lead times show mostly 1 with occasional 2 (observed LT samples: 2,1,1,1,2) so I estimate lead time from observed history rather than promised value. Demand has been higher recently than the older 2019-Jan samples; I use the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime. Thus: set L by calculating the average of observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the current demand level and volatility. These parameters prioritize service (reduce stockouts given short/variable LT) while keeping holding cost in check by using a recent demand estimate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent weekly demand (most recent 6 concluded periods) is much higher (~65-70s) than the early-sample mean (~30s); on-hand=0, in-transit=204. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1 or 2); I let backend calculate average observed lead time from concluded history. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 samples (N=6) so the base-stock reflects current demand and volatility while the OR engine caps orders via its cap rule. This balances higher service-level need from elevated demand against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=247 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show recent variability but average ~1.33 (recent observed Ls: 2,1,1). Recent demand has risen and become more variable (last 5 demands: 65,58,38,82,127; mean\u224874). To account for shorter observed lead times while reacting to recent demand regime and variability, I set L to the recent average (recent_N) using last 3 observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples (recent_N=5) so the OR engine targets service for the current higher-demand regime while the large in-transit buffer mitigates risk from delayed/lost shipments.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed Ls = {2,1,1,1,2} (avg\u22481.4) and several earlier multi-period absences\u2014shipments are variable but recent concluded evidence supports a shorter average than the promised L=2. I select L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period pattern). Demand parameters use default (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) because no confirmed sustained demand regime change (samples are limited and noisy); this balances service level (using inferred shorter L) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Demand has surged in recent weeks (Periods 13-17 demands = 38,82,127,114,97) so I bias forecasts to the most recent regime. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples: periods 13-17). This balances higher service-level need against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=353. History shows earlier 3-period absence of arrivals but multiple concluded arrivals across periods give observed lead times = [2,1,1,1,2,2,1] (avg \u22481.43). I therefore let the backend calculate L from observed lead times (captures recent mixture of 1\u20132 period Ls). Demand forecast and volatility use all historical samples (default) so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively; this balances service (using observed L) against holding cost without overfitting to recent noisy spikes.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Demand history shows volatile weekly demand with multiple concluded lead-times: observed Ls = {2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1} (avg \u22481.38). Current inventory: on-hand=25, in-transit=204 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand so no immediate shortage risk, but earlier multi-period non-conclusions justify using observed lead-time data rather than the promised L=2. I set L to be calculated from concluded arrivals (average observed LT) so the backend uses empirical lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine applies the full-sample demand estimate while adjusting for the inferred lead time; this balances service level (using observed shorter LT) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 \u2014 sizable pipeline but past periods showed variable/shorter actual lead times and some earlier missing arrivals. Recent observed lead times average ~1\u20131.5 periods, so I use a recent-average for L to reflect the empiric faster arrivals vs promised L=2. Demand has recently stabilized at a higher level (most recent 5 demands: 114,97,108,124,108; mean\u2248110), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples to capture the current regime. These choices (recent L, recent demand mean and std) instruct the OR engine to target a base stock tuned to the current faster lead-time and elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Observed concluded lead times vary (mixture of 1\u20132 periods; historical average \u22481.33) and some early multi-period absences suggest occasional delays/losses; to be conservative use the backend's calculated average lead time. Set L via calculate to let observed concluded lead times drive L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current higher-demand regime (captures recent mean \u2248105 and volatility).

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=222. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent average \u22481.3\u20131.6) indicating actual LT often < promised=2 but variable; several earlier multi-period absences suggested delayed/lost shipments but more recent concludes confirm shorter L on average. I select L='calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. Demand history is limited to weekly samples; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost while accounting for the inferred average lead time. This approach is conservative given large in-transit volume (222) and variability in observed LT.

Earlier multi-period absences signaled possible lost/delayed shipments, but recent concluded data supports a shorter average. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend use the empirical average. Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=315. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) with average \u22481.33 previously; some early multi-period non-conclusions suggest intermittent delays but recent arrivals show 1\u20132 period behavior. I let the backend infer L from observed concluded lead times (method=calculate). Demand has risen recently (last 5 demand observations: 91, 86, 128, 82, 78; recent mean \u224893), so I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. These choices keep the OR engine responsive to the empirically observed lead time while increasing target inventory to protect service levels given recent demand, balanced by the low holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent realized demand is high versus the small Jan samples; last 5 observed demands (P22-P26 = 86,128,82,78,43) average ~83.4/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (ample pipeline but past shipments have shown variable lead times including occasional 3-period delays). Use recent observed lead times to adapt L and recent demand window to capture current high-demand regime. Chosen methods: L by recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent realized lead-time pattern (weights recent 1\u20133 period variability); mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand capturing the current high-volume regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings make the backend compute a base-stock that balances high service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost while accounting for the recent variable lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=337. Concluded arrivals show variable but predominantly short lead times (observed Ls = {2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,3}; avg \u22481.64). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand; to reflect observed variability in recent demand I use a recent demand estimate while letting backend infer lead time from concluded history. Chosen L method uses calculated average observed lead time to capture actual variability; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to weight recent higher-demand periods; sigma_hat left as default so backend scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to keep service (covering review+lead demand) while avoiding excess holding given large in-transit and modest holding cost.

Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=362. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods); several multi-period delays and some lost-looking shipments earlier. I choose to let backend infer an empirical lead time average from concluded arrivals (method: calculate) so L reflects observed variability. For demand I use default aggregation (method: default) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default to capture historical volatility. This balances service (using observed lead time) versus holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=362. Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed Ls include 1,2,3) with recent arrivals tending longer than early-period 1s. Recent demand (Periods 25-29) = [78,43,76,68,64], mean=65.8. To be conservative given delayed/lost shipments earlier and recent longer L observations, I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent realized lead-time behavior; demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N on the last 5 demand samples to respond to the current lower-demand regime. These choices raise the review+lead demand estimate to cover (1+L) periods of demand while keeping variability sized to recent volatility, helping the OR engine produce orders that reduce stockouts from delayed shipments without excessive overstock given holding cost=$1/unit. 

Carry-over insight: Lead time increased: recent average of the last 5 observed lead-times = 2.0 (recent observed Ls incl. P17=2, P19=1, P22=2, P23=2, P26=3) \u2014 treat lead time as ~2 in short term.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 \u2014 substantial pipeline but prior periods show volatile/lengthening lead times (recent observed Ls: P17=2,P19=1,P22=2,P23=2,P26=3 \u2192 recent avg\u22482). Several multi-period delayed/lost arrivals earlier require conservative lead-time treatment. I choose to set L using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time regime (~2). Demand has recently averaged ~66 units/week over the last 5 weeks (Periods 26-30: 43,76,68,64,78) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Demand volatility also appears from these same 5 recent samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat. These choices make the OR backend size base-stock to cover the short-term ~2-period lead-time regime while using current demand level/volatility to balance service level versus holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent concluded arrivals show lead times have risen and the last 5 observed Ls average 2.0; pipeline (in-transit=319, on-hand=0) currently exceeds projected demand for (1+L) periods. I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=5) to capture the recent LT regime. Demand has trended ~70 units/week over the last 5 periods (Periods 27-31); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std). This keeps orders conservative given delayed arrivals while avoiding excess overstock since pipeline already covers ~3 periods of demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=319; historical concluded lead-times show recent increase and variability (recent 5 observed Ls avg \u22482.0). Recent demand in the last several weeks is materially higher than the small Jan baseline samples, so I use recent-window estimates for both lead time and demand. Set L as recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest observed lead-time regime (~2). Set mu_hat as recent_N (N=5) to scale demand to (1+L)\xd7recent mean and reflect current higher weekly demand. Set sigma_hat as recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize matching the OR engine's base-stock to observed current demand and the elevated recent lead time, while the large in-transit quantity will limit order sizes through the backend cap.

Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost, so I prefer a short-term lead-time based on recent observed Ls. Set L using recent_N=5 to reflect current ~2-period reality. Demand in the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 30-34 demands = 78,67,62,101,64; mean \u224874.4) defines the (1+L)-period demand forecast, so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat. Volatility also appears driven by these recent samples (includes a spike 101), so use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat. These choices make the OR backend target safety stock appropriate for a ~2-period lead time and recent demand regime while avoiding overreacting to older data and addressing prior missing/delayed shipments.

Historical concluded lead-times are variable but recent evidence (Periods up through 30) supports a short-term lead time \u22482 and multiple delayed shipments have occurred; maintain L=2 to be conservative. Use default demand estimates based on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap while accounting for the chosen lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): on-hand=0, in-transit=319. Historical concluded lead-times recently average ~2 periods and multiple multi-period delivery gaps/late arrivals suggest treating lead time as 2. I set L explicit=2 to reflect observed short-term reality and avoid underordering given delayed arrivals. Demand baseline: early-2019 weekly mean \u224835.6; (1+L)=3 \u21d2 forecast \u2248106.8, rounded to 108 units as mu_hat explicit to cover the review+lead window while avoiding extreme overstock. Volatility estimated from early samples (std\u22485.13) scaled by sqrt(1+L)\u22481.732 \u2192 sigma_hat \u22489 (explicit) to size safety stock modestly. These parameters bias orders toward service (reduce stockouts) given sustained delivery uncertainty while keeping holding cost moderate (holding=$1, profit=$19).

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=319. History shows variable observed lead times (1\u20133 periods) with recent average \u22482; several earlier orders were delayed but many later orders concluded. I choose to let backend compute a lead-time estimate from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (use observed LT) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=319. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (recent evidence around Period 30 suggested LT\u22482) and some lost/delayed shipments earlier; no new sustained demand regime change. I let the backend compute an empirical lead time from observed concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so L reflects recent observed LT history. Demand signals are not newly sustained, so use default demand estimates based on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (use observed LT) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past orders have not concluded recently. Promised L=2; recent concluded lead-time evidence (Periods up to 30) suggests ~2 in short term. I keep L as default (promised=2) to align with contract and OR backend expectations. Demand has trended lower in recent weeks; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures weeks P35\u2013P39 demands: 51,46,58,50,30) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, avoiding overweighting early-year higher demands. This balances service (use existing large in-transit) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand to size replenishment.

Carry-over insight: No concluded arrivals from Period 31 through Period 39 (9 consecutive periods) despite in-transit pipeline \u2014 sustained missing arrivals; treat some earlier shipments as potentially lost or severely delayed (in-transit=319).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 with a 9-period run (P31\u2013P39) of no concluded arrivals and earlier multi-period delays\u2014evidence of prolonged shipment delays or losses and a recent short-term upward shift in observed lead times. To be conservative and cover uncertainty in arrivals I set lead time explicit=3 (longer than promised 2) so the OR backend will plan for a larger pipeline. Demand estimates use default sample aggregation (no clear sustained demand regime shift in the sales history beyond normal variability), so mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively. This balances higher service against holding cost given high in-transit uncertainty.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=372 with many recent periods showing no concluded arrivals (sustained missing arrivals). Historical concluded lead-times show variability but recent evidence (Period 30 summary) indicates short-term lead time \u22482. To account for observed shift in lead time while letting the OR engine use historical demand, set L by averaging the most recent observed lead-times (recent_N, N=5). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand over review+lead using all samples (conservative given sparse visible arrivals). This balances service (longer recent L) against holding cost by not inflating demand forecast explicitly here\u2014we rely on OR base-stock calculation with updated L.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=372, recent concluded arrivals absent since P30 with many missing arrivals earlier \u2014 evidence of unstable shipments but recent observed lead-times averaged ~2 (see history). I set L explicit=2 to reflect the most-recent reliable short-term lead-time estimate and to avoid under-ordering given prolonged missing arrivals. Demand has been lower in recent weeks (Periods 38-42 demands: 50,30,28,22,45); I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast to current demand levels and the same recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This raises target pipeline to cover (1+L) periods of demand (improved service) while using recent data to limit excess holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=24, in-transit=319; historical concluded lead-times show recent upward drift with last-5 observed Ls averaging ~2. Demand in the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 39-43) averaged 30.8 units/week. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the short-term observed lead-time regime (~2). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7recent mean (captures current lower weekly demand). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to current demand while the cap limits excessive orders given the large in-transit pipeline and past missing arrivals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=6, in-transit=319, recent concluded lead-time evidence clustered around 1\u20133 with recent short-term average \u22482 and multiple prolonged missing arrivals earlier. To be conservative use explicit L=2 (matches promised and recent short-term avg) so pipeline coverage aligns with observed arrivals. Demand baseline (Jan samples mean\u224835.6) but recent observed weekly demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 28,22,45,29,18) is lower; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce overstating replenishment. This balances service (cover ~L+1 periods) vs holding cost given high in-transit volume and potential lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 with a history of prolonged missing arrivals and variable observed lead times; recent concluded lead-times cluster around ~2 but are noisy. Demand has settled lower in recent weeks (Periods 42-46 demands = 45,29,18,20,23). To be responsive to the current low-demand regime while accounting for recent lead-time variability, I use recent_N (N=5) for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L) demand and volatility from the most recent 5 observed samples. This keeps orders aligned with the recent demand level while letting the backend compute safety stock using the short-run lead-time estimate.
