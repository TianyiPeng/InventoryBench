History shows arrivals can be 1\u20132 periods but also gaps and some shipments arriving late or not at all; recent concludes (Periods 18\u201320) show no arrivals despite a large in-transit pipeline, so some uncertainty/loss risk exists. Given that many past in-transit batches eventually arrived (e.g., Periods 4,6,8,10,14,17), the 475 in-transit is likely to produce arrivals over the next 1\u20133 periods, so we should avoid adding inventory that increases holding cost unnecessarily.\n2) Demand outlook: Historical weekly samples (provided) give mean \u2248180.2. Recent realized demand has declined sharply (Periods 17\u201320: 99,127,83,41), indicating current demand is well below historical and OR's \u03bc\u0302-based forecast. No evidence of an immediate upcoming spike (calendar date 2019/7/1 \u2014 summer, not a tights peak).\n3) OR recommendation critique: OR suggests 123 units using promised L=2 and historical data; it cannot see the large in-transit or the recent fall in demand. Ordering per OR would add holding cost risk because in-transit stock (475) likely covers several weeks of current demand.\n4) Decision: Order 0 units. Rationale: avoid increasing ending inventory and holding cost given (a) large in-transit pipeline likely to arrive, (b) recent demand is low and declining, and (c) uncertainty about lost/late shipments argues for waiting to observe which in-transit batches actually conclude before placing replenishment.\n5) Operational note: Monitor concluded arrivals next 1\u20132 periods to confirm which in-transit units actually arrive; if arrivals are fewer than expected and demand recovers, reorder then.",
