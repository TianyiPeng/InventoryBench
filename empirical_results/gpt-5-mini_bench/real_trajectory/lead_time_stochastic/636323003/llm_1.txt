  "rationale": "Date 2019-02-11 (mid-Feb). SKU is ladies ankle denim \u2014 seasonal demand rising entering spring; historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend from 19 -> 46 -> 48 -> 62 -> 85 (through 2019-02-04). With supplier promised lead time 2 periods, orders placed now will arrive in Period 3; therefore we must plan for (L+1)=3 future periods of demand. Using recent trend and last observed week=85, I forecast ~80 units/week (conservative rounding of recent trend) and target coverage of 3 periods => 80*3 = 240 units. To balance holding cost vs. lost sales and avoid overstock, I choose a moderately lower order of 180 units (covers ~2.25 periods at forecast rate) given zero on-hand/in-transit and some uncertainty in trend/lead-time. This positions inventory to meet anticipated demand once shipments arrive while limiting holding cost exposure. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time or losses, so no adjustment to promised lead time.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 45 is 2019-12-16 (mid-December, holiday season) \u2014 could cause either elevated gift purchases or lower core denim demand; no SKU-specific holiday surge evident in recent history. Demand regime: last 6 weeks (P39\u2013P44) show low-to-moderate weekly demand with downward trend (46,38,37,85,47,29) and prior weeks (P32\u2013P38) were higher but not sustained. Lead time & pipeline: in-transit=741 units from prior orders; historical actual lead time is variable (1\u20133 periods) and some past orders were lost, so treat in-transit as deliverable but with uncertainty. Inventory impact: holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit \u2014 high profit justifies some inventory, but current large pipeline risks high holding cost if all arrive and demand remains low. Decision logic: given zero on-hand, large in-transit (741) that should cover many weeks even under elevated demand, and uncertain but previously observed multi-period lead times, do not place new order this period to avoid excess holding cost and to wait for concluded arrivals before reordering.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 modest upside risk of short-term holiday bump for apparel. Product: women's ankle denim, plausible gift-season demand but not a strong seasonal extreme. Demand analysis: recent observed weekly demand has fallen from the mid/high 100s (Sep) to much lower levels in Nov\u2013Dec; last 3 periods (P43\u2013P45) = 47, 29, 26 (avg ~34); last 6 (P40\u2013P45) avg ~43. Historical volatility exists but current short-term baseline ~30\u201350/week. Lead time & pipeline: carry-over notes show supplier lead time variable 1\u20133 periods; arrivals can be delayed or early. On-hand=0 but in-transit=741 units \u2014 ample coverage for many weeks even if arrivals are staggered. Risk assessment: holding cost $1 vs profit $19 supports stocking if sales expected, but existing in-transit quantity far exceeds short-term demand forecast and risks holding cost drag. Decision logic: do not issue new order this period. Let in-transit shipments arrive (variable lead times) and observe actual arrivals in conclude messages before placing replenishment. Order = 0 to avoid unnecessary overstock given large pipeline and uncertain arrival timing.",

{
  "rationale": "World & product: SKU is ladies denim (seasonally stable; end-Dec can see reduced footfall/holiday lull). Demand analysis: recent weeks show low demand (Periods 43-46 = 47,29,26,13) consistent with a subdued regime near ~25\u201335/week, well below prior high regimes. Lead time & pipeline: recent history shows supplier lead time variable (1\u20133 periods) and in-transit=741 units is large relative to current demand; many past orders have arrived after variable delays but arrivals are being tracked. Inventory & cost: on-hand=0, large in-transit likely to arrive and create substantial holding cost ($1/unit/period) if we overstock. Decision logic: do not place new orders while 741 units are in-transit and observed demand is low; avoid incurring extra holding cost and risk of unsold inventory given variable lead time. Order 0.",
