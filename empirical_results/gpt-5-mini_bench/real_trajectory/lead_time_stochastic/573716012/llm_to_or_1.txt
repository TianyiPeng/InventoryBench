Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable demand (~91.6 mean) with modest variance. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no arrival history to infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) implying neutral service level (q=0.5), so use default methods to let OR backend compute base stock from the full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time. This avoids overreacting to limited history while covering (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=109 (order placed P1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2192 no confirmed arrivals yet; could be on-time (arrives later) or delayed/lost but not enough evidence to change promised lead time. Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) avg\u224891.6 and one recent period demand=106 (single high week) \u2014 not a sustained regime shift. To avoid overreacting to a single spike while covering (1+L) review+lead demand, use promised lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (covers typical demand) vs holding cost given symmetric profit and holding=$1. No explicit upward adjustment because shipments are unconfirmed and signal is not sustained.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand 0, in-transit 222; two recent orders (P1=109, P2=113) have not concluded yet\u2014possible delay but only 2 periods of missing arrivals, not enough to confirm lead-time change. Historical weekly demand mean \u224891.6 (5 samples). Promised lead time remains the best prior. Use default lead time (promised=2) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean demand and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility; this keeps forecasts tied to long-run sample stats while the pipeline shortfall is monitored for future confirmed delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show weekly mean \u224891.6. Concluded history shows no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (three consecutive periods overdue), indicating promised LT=2 is not holding and shipments are delayed or lost. To be conservative, set explicit lead time L=3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, increasing target stock to protect service level given delays while balancing holding cost via the engine's q-based z*.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears to have increased: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived by Period 3 conclude (sustained 3-period delay).

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows a P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2); P1 and P3 orders remain outstanding but P2 arrival confirms at least some 2-period lead-time fulfillment. On-hand=0, in-transit=403 (includes outstanding orders). I choose L.method="calculate" to let backend use observed lead times (evidence: P2\u2192P4 lead_time=2). Demand history (five weekly samples, mean\u224891.6) and promised review+lead horizon (1+L) imply using default demand aggregation: mu_hat.method="default" ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat.method="default" (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings bias orders to cover the full (L+1) periods of expected demand while relying on observed lead-time evidence rather than the original promise, helping balance service level and holding cost given current pipeline of 403 units and zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=429. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (order on P2 arrived P4). Demand has jumped sharply vs historical samples: recent period demands (P1\u2013P5 = 106,207,260,254,278) indicate a sustained higher regime versus older weekly samples. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (uses P1\u2013P5) so mu_hat covers (1+L) periods of the new higher-demand regime and sigma_hat reflects recent variability; this increases service-level protection amid prior shipment delays while controlling excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: recent avg (P1\u2013P5)=221 vs historical sample avg=91.6 (+141%), sustained 5 periods

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: Periods 1\u20136 demand = [106,207,260,254,278,312] with a clear elevated mean vs historical samples. Lead-time observations: arrived from Period 2 in Period 4 (LT=2) and arrived from Period 5 in Period 6 (LT=1) \u2014 mixed recent evidence. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (focus on the most recent stable demand window). I set L using recent_N=2 to average the two observed lead times (conservative estimate between 1 and 2). This directs the OR backend to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, increasing orders to meet the elevated demand while acknowledging lead-time uncertainty and avoiding excessive holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand is well above historical (sustained high-demand regime: recent avg P1\u2013P5=221 vs historical 91.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=787 (large pipeline, some shipments delayed historically). Observed concluded lead times: order on P2->arrived P4 (2); order on P5->arrived P6 (1) \u2192 average = 1.5, so use calculated lead time to reflect observed variability. Set L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (N chosen = 5 per detected 5-period sustained shift). For volatility, use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variance. These choices make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the confirmed high-demand regime while L=calculate captures mixed lead-time evidence; with large in-transit stock (787) the OR engine\u2019s capped ordering will avoid excessive new orders but the updated demand forecast raises target base stock to reduce future stockouts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=533. Concluded lead-time observations = [2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8)] (avg 1.5). Demand has shifted sharply upward and is accelerating (recent demands P4\u2013P8 = [254,278,312,423,609], recent avg=375.2 vs historical sample avg=91.6). I set L using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the observed mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals (captures recent variability rather than blindly using promised 2). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to scale the (1+L) forecast to the clearly higher recent demand regime (captures the current elevated mean). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased demand volatility in recent periods. These choices increase target stock to avoid stockouts in the sustained high-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for presumed longer delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and intensifying: avg demand P4\u2013P8 = 375.2 (5 periods) vs historical sample avg 91.6 (+309%), sustained through Period 8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 4 (avg P4\u2013P8 = 375.2 vs historical 91.6) and mixed observed lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,2,1 \u2192 recent avg 1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=1126 (large pipeline). To reflect the confirmed high demand, I set demand forecast using recent samples (capture the P4\u2013P8 high regime). For lead time I use the recent average of observed lead times (last 4 observed) to smooth the 1/2 alternation. Sigma uses recent volatility over the demand regime window. These choices push the backend to target a higher base stock to cover the intensified demand while using the recent lead-time estimate to avoid overordering despite large in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead times alternating 1\u20132 periods (observed sequence avg ~1.5). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (recent 5-period mean ~441.6 vs historical ~91.6). On-hand=301 + in-transit=516 = 817 units available in pipeline. I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect the 1\u20132 period reality (allows backend to target (1+L) coverage appropriately). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples P6\u2013P10) so mu_hat reflects the new high-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to capture increased volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to serve the intensified demand while the calculated L prevents underordering if some shipments take 2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been much higher than historical samples (sustained surge: P7\u2013P11 demands = 423,609,442,422,535; recent avg \u2248 486). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1024 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use aggregated observed average (calculate) so backend adapts to measured variability. Set demand forecast to use the most recent 5 periods to capture the sustained high-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to meet the new high demand while sigma based on recent variability prevents understocking; relying on observed lead-time average helps account for intermittent 1\u20132 period shipments and potential delays.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent demand has clearly shifted to a much higher regime vs historical samples: recent 5-period average demand (P8\u2013P12) is ~510 units/week vs historical ~91.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=1459. With promised lead time 2, review+lead horizon is 3 periods; expected demand over 3 periods \u2248 3\xd7510=1530, so pipeline (1459) is slightly short of coverage. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses P8\u2013P12). This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. These parameters help the OR backend raise service-level targets to avoid stockouts while limiting extra holding by using only recent data.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has shifted to a much higher regime: last 5 demands (P9\u2013P13) avg \u2248 471.6 vs historical sample mean 91.6 (+~415%). On-hand=93, in-transit=1024 (pipeline=1117) \u2014 ample pipeline inventory now. Observed lead times (from conclude messages) are mixed 1\u20132 with average \u22481.6; use calculated average to let backend adapt. Forecast choice: use recent demand (most recent 5 weeks) to capture sustained high-demand regime; use recent volatility over same window. These settings prioritize service (raise base stock to meet elevated demand) while backend cap will limit excessive single-period ordering given holding cost parity with profit. No evidence of new lost shipments beyond previously resolved variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): recent demand remains at a higher regime (P10\u2013P14 avg=478.8 units/week) vs historical sample mean=91.6. On-hand=50, in-transit=887 (pipeline large enough but monitor for lost shipments). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 avg ~1.625; use calculate to let backend use observed average. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (P10\u2013P14). For sigma use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to meet the persistently elevated demand while the large pipeline limits immediate stockouts; using recent data reduces reliance on low historical baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=1387. Historical concludes show mixed lead times (mostly 2, some 1); recent pattern supports using the observed average lead time. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (sustained high weekly sales from Periods 1\u20138 onward); I use a recent-window demand estimate so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new high-demand regime and higher volatility. Using recent_N for demand (N=8) captures the most recent sustained regime while avoiding dilution by the low historical baseline. These parameters will raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon for the new demand regime while sigma_hat_recent increases safety stock to protect service level given shipment variability and past delayed arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (many periods with demand >> historical sample mean). Observed concluded lead times include both 1 and 2 periods; use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=1469 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but recent high demand argues for forecasting based on the most recent regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (periods 12\u201316) to capture the elevated mean (~458 units over a review+lead window) and recent variability; this tightens orders on current high-demand regime while respecting pipeline. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand but rely on the backend cap to limit per-period order size given lead-time uncertainty and holding cost parity (profit=holding).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=224, in-transit=887. Historical small-sample mean (Jan) is ~91.6 but recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime (P13\u2013P17 mean ~421). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); use a recent average to reflect current mix and possible variability. Set L by recent_N to capture the last 5 observed lead-time realizations; set mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N N=5 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent high-demand regime (P13\u2013P17). This balances higher target stock for the new demand level while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering given in-transit volumes and possible shipment delays.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 1 with strong confirmation P4\u2013P8 and recent five-period average remaining high (Periods 14\u201318 avg \u2248 402 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=1039 (sufficient pipeline but some shipments recently delayed intermittently). Observed concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2); use observed average for L. Set L via calculate (use average observed lead times) to reflect realized variability. Forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 demands). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (meet current high demand) while using recent variance to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime for many periods (recent 5-period mean \u2248 367.8 vs historical \u224891.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 (some in-transit shipments have recent 1\u20132 period lead times). To let the OR engine target the elevated demand while using the promised LT, I keep L at default (promised=2) so backend uses its assumed lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the backend builds base_stock from the most recent high-demand regime (captures (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts vs high recent demand) against holding cost by relying on the recent-demand estimates rather than long-run low historical mean.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent demand has been in a higher regime vs historical samples: last 5-period demands (P16\u2013P20) = [382,358,322,305,214], recent mean \u2248316 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=1104 units \u2014 enough to cover ~3 periods at the recent rate (3\xd7316\u2248948) so pipeline is healthy. Observed lead times in history alternate 1\u20132 but were confirmed as 2 in prior conclude messages; use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility, so the backend bases base-stock on current high-demand mean while capping order size per its cap rule.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical baseline but has softened from the peak; last 5 concluded demands (P17\u2013P21) avg \u2248 274.8 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=1104 units \u2014 this pipeline already covers multiple review+lead periods, so no urgent replenishment. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods \u2248 responsive to recent demand). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep orders aligned with the current demand regime while relying on the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Observed concluded lead times across history show a mix of 1 and 2 periods with more 2s; recent confirms occasional 2-period arrivals (e.g., P20->P22). Demand remains in the elevated regime vs original samples; recent 5-period demand (P18\u2013P22) is the most relevant short-term signal. To balance service rate vs holding cost: infer L from observed lead times (calculate average), and use recent demand (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the current elevated regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Recent demand (P19\u2013P23) = [305,214,175,139,116], recent 5-period avg \u2248 189.8, showing a downtrend from earlier peak but still well above original sample mean. Observed lead times in history fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods with confirmations of 2 in several past arrivals; no sustained lost shipments currently. To balance service vs holding cost I use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates from the most recent 5 observed demands (captures current regime and recent decline). Volatility is estimated from the same recent 5 periods to reflect recent variation and avoid overstock from legacy high-peak periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 with average ~1.58; recent demand (last 5 periods P20\u2013P24) = [214,175,139,116,90], avg=146.8, which is substantially lower than earlier high-regime bursts. I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history average (~1.58) rather than the promised fixed value. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent downward demand trend and avoid overstocking given large in-transit inventory. Sigma also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce risk of excess holding costs given 1056 units already in transit while keeping coverage for (1+L) upcoming periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325) = [175,139,116,90,81], mean \u2248 120.6 \u2014 higher than original historical sample mean (91.6) but well below earlier peaks. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1056 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand for L=2. Actual lead time history has been noisy but was confirmed as 2 in prior concluded messages; no sustained new lead-time evidence since. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (2) and keep parameters aligned with backend expectations. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower post-peak regime (use the last 5 observed demands). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the current regime while the large in-transit pipeline avoids urgent replenishment and limits unnecessary holding cost.

Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical sample mean=91.6 (given). Recent concluded lead times (observed) average ~1.58; I use 'calculate' so backend will set L to the observed-average lead time rather than the promised default, capturing realized variability. Demand shows no new sustained regime shift in the most recent periods, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock from long-run historical demand while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (by reflecting observed lead-time >1) against holding cost given current large pipeline (1056 units).

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. History shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods); I let backend infer the average observed lead time via 'calculate'. Pipeline (1056) is large so I use default demand/statistics to avoid overfitting short recent swings: mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5) and accounts for possible lost/delayed shipments by using the averaged lead time rather than a very short recent estimate.

Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328) = [90,81,76,85,84], recent 5-period mean \u2248 83.2 which is well below the historical sample mean (91.6) and far below earlier spike periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=1056 (large pipeline). No new sustained lead-time shift in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded messages show lead time=2 historically and no new evidence to change it. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (use last 5 realized demands) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility rather than the older high-demand spikes\u2014this avoids over-ordering given the large existing in-transit volume and symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) which favors tighter stocking.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has fallen to a low regime across Periods 21\u201329 (175,139,116,90,81,76,85,84,57). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 (sizable pipeline). No new multi-period lead-time evidence since earlier confirmation of L=2, so keep promised lead time. I set L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the new low-demand regime (use last 9 periods: P21\u2013P29) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean rather than being pulled by early high-demand samples. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent low-volatility. This reduces excess orders given large pipeline and high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit), balancing service level vs holding risk.

No recent concluded arrivals contradicting promised lead time, so use promised lead time. Set L=default to let backend assume promised 2-period lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces overstock risk given large in-transit). Use sigma recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to current lower demand while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to avoid further overordering.

In-transit stock is large relative to recent demand, so keep lead time at promised (default) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current low regime.

Promised lead time is 2 periods; no recent concluded evidence that lead time differs. I set L=default to trust promised LT for the OR engine. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces target base-stock vs historical high-demand periods) while relying on large in-transit to avoid over-ordering. This balances service (use pipeline) vs holding cost by lowering forecasted demand and variance to match recent weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but recent observed lead times average ~1.6 periods; demand over the last 5 periods (P29\u2013P33) averages ~75 units, noticeably lower than earlier high-volatility regime. To be responsive to recent lower demand while reflecting slightly under-2 average lead time, I set L using recent lead-time evidence and set demand forecast/volatility using the last 5 demand samples. This keeps the backend base-stock focused on current demand levels and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 which already provides multi-week coverage. No recent evidence of lead-time change; promised lead time (2) was previously confirmed. I therefore set L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (regime length = 5 recent low-demand weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5) to reflect the lower current demand and avoid excess holding. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to capture volatility in the same recent window. This balances service (use in-transit coverage) vs holding cost by tuning forecasts to the recent low-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical baseline mean\u224891.6 but recent demand has been a low regime since Period 29. Recent demands (P29\u2013P35): [57,59,72,62,126,39,35], mean\u224864.3 \u2014 sustained 7 periods. No new confirmed lead-time change; promised L=2 remains appropriate. To avoid overstocking given large in-transit and low recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (capture current low-demand regime). These parameters reduce target base stock relative to historical baseline and let OR backend offset the large pipeline inventory while preserving service vs holding tradeoff.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical sample mean=91.6 (5 samples from Jan\u2013Feb). Recent concluded history shows variable lead times but no new sustained lead-time regime since prior insights; recent demand since Period 21\u201336 has been low and noisy (no sustained spike), so I will use the promised lead time and the historical demand statistics (conservative baseline). Using default L lets the OR engine assume promised lead time=2; default mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean(all samples)=3*91.6, providing a moderate replenishment level; default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed variability. This balances service vs holding cost given large in-transit stock (1056) and uncertain arrivals.

Recent concluded demands (Periods 33\u201337) are low (39\u2013126, mean ~67) and show no new sustained regime shift vs earlier samples that seeded the prior model. No new confirmed lead-time change in conclude history. Using default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates keeps the backend's (1+L)\xd7historical-mean forecast and cautious safety stock; given large in-transit inventory this will avoid placing additional orders and limit holding cost while preserving service capability when arrivals conclude.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods (many 2s); demand history includes early 2019 high-growth episodes but recent weeks (P34\u2013P38) show low demand. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 variability). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples based on full sample set; this is conservative given recent decline and avoids overcommitting inventory despite large in-transit pipeline. This balances service level (by respecting observed lead-time average) against holding cost (avoids inflating forecast from transient past spikes).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 \u2014 large pipeline that will cover multiple weeks. Historical base samples mean=91.6 (provided). Recent concluded history shows no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts since prior carry-over insights; several past periods had low realized demand but pipeline is already large. To avoid overreacting and because promised lead time is 2, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this prevents unnecessary extra ordering given current 1056 in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 (sizable pipeline). Recent realized demand (Periods 36\u201340) is low: [47,70,58,61,52] \u2192 recent mean \u224857 units/week. Earlier carry-over signaled past high-demand regimes, but the last 5 periods show demand has returned to a low steady level. Lead time has been confirmed previously as 2 periods; no new arrival evidence to change that. To avoid overstocking given holding cost = profit, I use the promised/default lead time and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current low-demand regime while letting the large in-transit stock cover upcoming demand spikes if they recur.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 (large pipeline). Recent concluded history (Periods 33\u201341) shows modest, stable low weekly demand; no new sustained demand or lead-time shift since prior carry-over insights. Given the large in-transit position and lack of fresh evidence for a changed lead time or new demand regime, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the full historical sample stats to compute base-stock and caps. This avoids over-ordering ahead of Black Friday without confirmed demand increase and leverages pipeline inventory to satisfy upcoming demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056 which already covers several periods of elevated demand. Historical early samples are low but recent history shows large, volatile spikes (notably Period 42 demand=431). Promised lead time 2 has been previously confirmed; I keep L as default to let backend use promised lead time. To respond to recent upward volatility while still smoothing noise I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so the forecast emphasizes recent spikes but dampens single-period outliers. Sigma_hat kept as default to let backend scale uncertainty from full-sample variability. These choices balance service (capture recent demand increases) versus holding cost (in-transit stock already large, avoid explicit overforecasting).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical baseline samples (early 2019) show mean ~91.6, but recent periods show a large, sustained demand regime shift earlier in the year (carry-over notes) and very high recent weekly demand (Periods 39\u201343 = [61,52,41,431,250]) indicating volatility with two large spikes. Lead-time conclude history previously confirmed LT=2 and no new concluded arrivals contradict that, so keep promised/default L. To capture the recent elevated/volatile demand while giving weight to the most recent weeks, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting current regime and higher uncertainty. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting the window to recent observations rather than the long-run low baseline.

Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Historical concluded lead times include many 2-period observations and carry-over confirms actual lead time = 2; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows a pronounced late spike (Periods 42\u201343) so I bias forecasts to the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 (captures Periods 40\u201344 demands = 52,41,431,250,34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the current higher-variance recent pattern while the cap limits oversized orders. This balances service level (capture recent spikes) vs holding cost (cap + recent volatility).

Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms L\u22482 and no new sustained lead-time change. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated, variable demand regime and to let the OR engine size base-stock relative to the most relevant recent mean/volatility while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=1056. Recent demand (Periods 42\u201346) = [431,250,34,239,117], avg=214.2 \u2014 materially above historical sample avg (~91.6) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime.

I leave L as default (promised lead time) since concluded history supports 2 periods and no new sustained lead-time change is observed. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand stats rather than long-term low baseline.
