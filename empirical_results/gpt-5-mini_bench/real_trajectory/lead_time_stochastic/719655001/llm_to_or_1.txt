Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 719655001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04): [99,127,104,87,146] give no recent concluded arrivals to infer lead time; no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so OR backend applies standard base-stock sizing. This balances service (capture mean weekly demand ~112) versus holding cost given available data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=152 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). Historical weekly demand samples mean=112.6 units, std\u224823.65. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; single missed arrival is insufficient to declare a lead-time shift. I use default lead time (promised L=2) so the OR backend uses the promised lead time. For demand I use default aggregation: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of all samples -> (1+2)*112.6 \u2248 337.8, and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) -> sqrt(3)*23.65 \u2248 41.0. These conservative defaults rely on full historical data and avoid overreacting to one delayed shipment while providing the OR engine a demand forecast that balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=329 (orders from P1/P2). Two prior orders have not yet concluded but that is expected given promised L=2 (their arrivals will be confirmed in conclude messages after this period). Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show mean demand ~112.6. No concluded evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised L=2) so backend uses full promised lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (higher base-stock for 3-period coverage) against low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean \u2248112.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=519, but concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 show arrived=0 despite promised L=2 \u2192 sustained missing shipments for 3 periods. To guard against further delays/losses, I increase the assumed lead time so the OR engine plans for a longer coverage window. Chosen: L explicit to extend coverage; mu_hat default to use full-sample mean scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (protect vs. potential lost/delayed arrivals) against holding cost by increasing target base-stock coverage while relying on historical demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived by their expected promise (3 consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0); sustained missing/delayed shipments suspected\u2014treat as potential lost shipments until an arrival conclude is observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1743.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent conclude shows Period 2 order arrived with observed lead_time=2; Periods 1 and 3 orders remain unconcluded (possible lost/delayed). On-hand=81, in-transit=541 \u2014 pipeline large but arrival timing uncertain. I use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times) to reflect confirmed evidence (observed 2). For demand I keep default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps from full historical samples while accounting for L=2. This balances service (use observed lead time) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent concluded history shows significant early-period demand (P1=173,P2=199) then normalization (P3=147,P4=96,P5=101). On-hand=0, in-transit=541 (large pipeline). One concluded arrival indicates an observed lead time of 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Given this evidence and the promised lead time=2, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend use confirmed data. Demand samples (historical weekly series) show mean ~112.6; using default (all-samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the forecast anchored to the full history while the backend will scale for (1+L). This balances service (large pipeline present) versus holding costs and avoids overreacting to short-run noise or possible missing shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=541. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time consistent with promised L=2 (Period 4 conclude: order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2). Orders from earlier periods show some missing arrivals but no sustained change to confirmed lead time beyond L=2. Use default demand estimates based on full sample history to avoid overreacting to recent noisy/missing arrivals. Default choices produce mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=541 which equals outstanding orders: P1(152)+P3(190)+P4(199)=541. Observed arrival evidence: P2 order arrived in P4 => observed lead time = 2 (matches promised). No sustained new lead-time or demand regime change (single confirmed lead-time observation; recent periods had zero on-hand due to stockouts but not a sustained demand shift). To let the OR engine use its default statistical estimates (which incorporate all historical samples) and because actual lead time evidence aligns with the promise, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=541. Recent demand (Periods 4-8) averaged ~103 units/week (96,101,92,112,115) indicating a stable ~100/week regime after the early volatile start. Periods 1\u20133 had delayed arrivals but Period 4 confirmed a 2-period lead time for the Period 2 order; no sustained new evidence to change promised lead time. Given the stable recent demand, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) to capture the current regime and recent_N volatility to reflect recent variability. I keep L as default (promised 2) because conclude messages confirm occasional 2-period arrivals and there is no conclusive sustained shift in lead time. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the recent mean while using recent variance to set an appropriate safety stock given holding cost vs. profit tradeoff.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent demand samples range 99\u2013146 (weekly). On-hand=0, in-transit=541; many units in pipeline but several past orders previously showed arrived=0, so missing/delayed shipments suspected. Observed arrival evidence: Period 4 conclude shows order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 this balances service level (profit/holding cost) while relying on full history given no strong, sustained demand regime change.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history shows repeated zero-arrival conclude messages (Periods 1\u20133) suggesting missing/delayed shipments, but lead time was later confirmed as 2 (Period 10 evidence). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=541. To reflect confirmed observed lead-time while relying on full-sample demand prior (stable historical weekly samples provided), set L via observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies its base-stock with the promised lead time informed by observed data; this balances service (using confirmed L=2) against holding cost given substantial in-transit units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows prolonged zero arrivals after Period 4, but Period 4 concluded an order from Period 2 arrived with lead time 2 (confirmed). Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=541. Historical weekly mean demand = 112.6 (samples provided). With promised L=2 and confirmed observation, set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect evidence (calculate\u21922). Use default demand scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) capturing the baseline 3-week demand; sigma_hat default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). The large in-transit (541) comfortably exceeds the (1+L)-period demand forecast (~338), so no extra urgent replenishment is needed; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline and uncertain missing shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=541. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) avg\u2248112.6/wk; recent stockouts and earlier missing concludes observed but lead time was confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2\u21924). In-transit volume (541) likely covers upcoming demand; to keep policy stable and let OR backend apply its lead-time correction, use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility based on all samples. This avoids overreacting to intermittent missing-conclude signals while letting backend cap orders against pipeline.

Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=541 but many recent conclude messages show arrived=0 (sustained missing/delayed shipments earlier); however lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods. Use promised/default lead time to let OR engine assume L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples \u2014 this is conservative given limited signal for a true demand regime shift and lets the OR optimizer balance service level vs holding cost using known profit/holding params.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed weekly demand average across all samples \u224895.3 units; promised lead time=2 was previously confirmed from history. On-hand=0, in-transit=541 \u2014 in-transit alone covers multiple review+lead periods (3\xd7mean \u2248286), so no aggressive upward forecast or increased safety stock needed. There are prior missing/delayed shipments noted historically, but lead time evidence supports using the promised/overall stats. I therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and avoids placing unnecessary orders while the large pipeline clears.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=541. History shows sustained missing/delayed shipments earlier but lead time was confirmed as 2 in Period 10; pipeline is large though uncertain. Use promised lead time (default L=2) so OR backend uses contractual lead time while we monitor arrivals. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand episodes (last 5 observed demand samples) including late-April/May demand spikes despite stockouts. Keep sigma_hat default to use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use recent demand for mean) vs holding cost (using promised L and default sigma avoids overinflating safety stock given uncertain arrivals).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=541. Historical concludes show a confirmed lead time of 2 (Period 4 evidence) but many subsequent conclude messages with arrived=0. I keep L as the promised/default (2) to align with confirmed evidence and OR backend assumptions. Demand has been elevated and variable recently (notably Period 12 demand=157); to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the last 5 observed demands to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances higher recent demand against holding cost and leverages the large in-transit pipeline (541) so the OR engine will order relative to recent realized demand while not overreacting to isolated spikes.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals Periods 5\u201316: conclude messages for Periods 5 through 16 all show arrived=0 (12 consecutive periods with no arrivals after Period 4), suggesting ongoing lost/delayed shipments for orders placed earlier.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). History shows prolonged missing/delayed arrivals through Period 17 despite a confirmed lead time=2 earlier (Period 4); in-transit is large (541) and shipments have been unreliable. To be conservative against further unseen delays/losses, I increase the lead-time estimate to 3 periods (explicit) so the OR backend orders earlier/ larger to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Demand forecasting uses defaults (no strong, sustained change in observed demand regime since prior insights), so mu_hat and sigma_hat remain 'default' letting the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples. This balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=575. History shows prolonged missing/delayed arrivals but we have at least one observed lead-time of 2 (order P2 arrived P4). Use observed lead times average to let backend infer current effective L. Demand has shown recent uptick; to react to the latest regime, forecast using the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 16-18) for both mean and volatility so the base-stock responds to recent demand while avoiding overcommit given missing arrivals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=541 but history shows prolonged missing arrivals followed by a recent arrival with lead_time=1 and an earlier confirmed lead_time=2\u2014evidence of inconsistent/partially-lost shipments. Use observed lead times to estimate L (average of concluded lead times = 1.5) so the OR engine accounts for actual timing variability; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical demand samples) because demand history is limited to the provided samples and no sustained demand regime shift is newly confirmed. This balances service level (using observed lead-time mean) against holding cost given large in-transit uncertainty.

Historical concludes show two observed lead times: 2 periods (P2\u2192P4) and 1 period (P18\u2192P19); shipments have been intermittently missing but recent single short arrival is not yet a sustained change. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations). Demand forecast uses defaults (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) based on all samples and the chosen L, keeping the OR engine's (1+L) scaling and overall variance estimation; this is conservative given noisy arrivals and avoids overreacting to a single short lead-time observation while leveraging the large in-transit position.

History shows prolonged periods of arrived=0 (Periods 5\u201316) indicating missing/delayed shipments, but we have two concluded lead-time observations: order on P2 arrived P4 (LT=2) and order on P18 arrived P19 (LT=1). I choose L="calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times (uses observed 2 and 1). With lead-time uncertainty and missing shipments, keep demand forecast and volatility computed by the backend from full sample history: mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so base-stock and caps are computed consistently using (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (by adapting L to observed arrivals) versus holding cost given frequent stockouts and in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been high and volatile (multiple weeks 150-200+); on-hand=0 but large in-transit=541 with history of delayed/lost shipments. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P18->P19) \u2014 use recent average to reflect mixed/evolving lead time. Use recent_N (N=10) for demand mean/volatility to capture the sustained high-demand regime in the last 10 concluded periods (Periods 13\u201322) and shrink influence of early low-sample weeks. These parameters increase forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to raise the base-stock and compensate for delayed arrivals while keeping cap behavior in mind to limit excessive orders given holding cost.

Many prior periods had prolonged missing arrivals suggesting lost/delayed shipments; pipeline may include undelivered/lost units so use inferred average LT rather than promised. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times (captures 2 and 1). Recent demand (past months) is substantially higher than the early-sample mean; use recent_N for demand mean/volatility to reflect the current high-demand regime. Choose N=20 to capture the most recent 20 periods of demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing responsiveness and sample size. These choices raise the base-stock to meet recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability; using calculated L accounts for observed shorter/variable lead times and mitigates ordering under the mistaken promised LT.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=550. History shows intermittent actual lead times (1 and 2) and many prolonged zero-arrival conclude messages suggesting lost/delayed shipments; pipeline quantity is large but arrival timing uncertain. To be conservative against potential further delays I set L explicitly to 3 periods (longer than the promised 2) so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. Demand has clearly shifted up versus the provided 2019 Jan samples; I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5, using the most recent 5 observed weekly demands) so the (1+L)-scaled mean reflects current higher weekly demand. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices increase the base-stock target to improve service given uncertain arrivals while keeping variance estimated from recent data to avoid extreme overstocking.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed leads: 2 at P4, 1 at P19, 3 at P26) and many earlier missing arrivals; therefore estimate lead time from observed sample average. Demand has shifted upward in later periods (sustained higher weekly demand ~140\u2013200 since Period 18), so I use recent data for the demand forecast and volatility. Given a large in-transit pipeline (656) I avoid aggressive replenishment; the chosen parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock reflecting the recent higher-demand regime while the calculated lead-time helps reconcile variable/occasionally delayed arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P18\u2192P19), 3 (P23\u2192P26) \u2014 recent variability suggests using a short recent average. Demand recent weeks elevated (~130\u2013156). To be responsive to recent demand and variable arrivals I set L using recent_N=3 (average of last 3 observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 24\u201328), which captures the current higher-demand regime while avoiding stale early samples. This balances service (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given many in-transit units and past missing shipments: using recent estimates prevents overreacting to older zero-sales periods while the OR engine cap will limit excessively large orders given pipeline inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been consistently high (~100-200/week); on-hand=0, in-transit=656 (large pipeline but many past shipments were delayed/lost). Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P4), 1 (P19), 3 (P26)}; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, which is appropriate given no clear persistent demand regime change and to let the large pipeline be reconciled by the backend forecast. This balances service (capture high mean demand) vs holding cost by relying on backend base-stock sizing with observed lead-time average.

Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (observed W={2,1,3} periods) and many delayed/missing arrivals earlier; recent evidence does not show a sustained shift in lead time beyond variability. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability). Demand forecast and volatility: use defaults (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses full historical demand sample set scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (captures observed lead-time variability) versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. History shows many prolonged missing/delayed shipments but three concluded arrivals provide observed lead times {2,1,3} (avg=2.0). Pipeline is large but partly unverified; using calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time. Demand has been stable but elevated in recent months (last 5 demands: 116,95,? \u2014 using a short recent window) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current regime and limit influence of older winter samples. These choices balance service (use observed LT and recent demand) vs. holding cost by not over-inflating safety stock from long historic series.

Recent concluded history shows highly variable/unstable arrivals (observed lead times: 2,1,3) and many periods with zero arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=656 (large pipeline that may include delayed/lost shipments). Baseline demand sample mean = 112.6 (from provided samples). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability). I select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std from full sample set, letting the backend compute safety stock given profit/holding cost tradeoff while we remain conservative due to missing arrivals.

Use calculate for L to let backend set L=2. Given many delayed/lost shipments but mixed observed lead times, keep demand/volatility estimation broad by using defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Several prolonged periods with arrived=0 indicate past lost/delayed shipments, but recent arrivals show lead-time variability around 2. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1/2/3 variability). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all demand samples to produce (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (given large in-transit volume) against holding costs while letting backend apply the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

To reflect empirical lead-time behavior I set L by averaging observed lead times. Given large in-transit inventory and no strong recent demand regime shift, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand history shows ongoing customer demand but no on-hand stock (on-hand=0) and a large in-transit quantity (656) whose arrivals have not been concluding reliably. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 for order P2), 1 (P19 for order P18), 3 (P26 for order P23) \u2192 average lead time \u22482. Use calculated L to reflect observed average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because historical weekly samples (99,127,104,87,146) remain the best demand seed and no confirmed sustained shift in demand mean/variance beyond previously recorded patterns. This balances service level (use observed average lead time) while avoiding overreacting to volatile/possibly lost in-transit shipments.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals Periods 27\u201337: 11 consecutive periods with no arrivals (Periods 27 through 37 conclude all arrived=0), suggesting ongoing lost/delayed shipments for recent orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. History shows many prolonged periods with arrived=0 since Period 5 and recent long gaps (Periods 27\u201337) indicating likely lost/delayed shipments; however earlier concludes confirmed occasional true lead_time=2. Given mixed evidence (confirmed LT=2 historically but many lost shipments) I will keep L as the promised lead time (default) so the OR engine uses its assumed L=2, and use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the backend's statistical recipe intact while we monitor for any future conclude that would confirm persistent lead-time change or arrival recovery. The high in-transit level is flagged\u2014if arrivals continue to be missing we will switch to an explicit longer L or treat shipments as lost in future periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. History shows prolonged intermittent missing/delayed arrivals (multiple multi-period runs of arrived=0) but realized lead times observed at 1,2,3\u2014no single sustained new lead-time to override promise. To avoid overreacting to suspected lost shipments while still responding to recent demand pattern, keep L as promised (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture current demand level. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat tightens service around recent demand while the backend cap limits order size to control exposure to lost shipments; this balances service (profit) vs. holding cost given high in-transit inventory and uncertain arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. History shows many prolonged missing arrivals but three concluded arrivals give observed lead times = 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P18\u2192P19), 3 (P23\u2192P26) \u2014 average ~2. To be conservative and let the backend use observed lead-time history, set L to 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages full sample history rather than short recent windows given noisy/missing arrivals. This balances service level (using observed lead-time average) vs holding cost while avoiding overreacting to gaps likely caused by lost shipments.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=656; many conclude messages since Period 27 show arrived=0, suggesting prolonged/delayed shipments. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P18\u2192P19), 3 (P23\u2192P26) \u2014 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history shows no clear recent regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices let the OR engine incorporate empiric lead-time evidence while keeping demand estimates conservative given uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals Periods 27\u201341: 15 consecutive periods (Periods 27 through 41 conclude all arrived=0), indicating ongoing lost/delayed shipments for recent orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=656. History shows many prolonged missing arrivals (Periods 27\u201342 conclude arrived=0) indicating volatile/extended actual lead times and potential lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative above the promised 2 (recent observed lead times include 1\u20133 and many missing arrivals). Demand appears elevated recently (including a large spike Period 42=385), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 38\u201342) which captures the recent surge while limiting dilution by older low-demand periods. These choices bias orders upward to cover near-term demand and longer effective lead time while keeping holding costs in mind.

Promised L=2 but shipments have been intermittently delayed; to be conservative I set lead time = 3 (explicit) to cover potential extended transit. Demand history shows no sustained, recent regime shift (aside from an isolated spike in Period 42), so I leave demand forecast and volatility to the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances higher safety vs. holding cost given large in-transit volume and missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1025. History shows intermittent concluded lead times (observed 2,1,3) but prolonged periods of zero arrivals since Period 26 and recent large/isolated demand spikes (Period 42=385) that are not yet a sustained regime. Because only concluded arrivals can confirm lead-time shifts and we lack a sustained recent demand regime (>=3 periods), I use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample statistics. This avoids overreacting to isolated spikes or to the ongoing missing-arrival pattern until a clear concluded arrival sequence confirms a new lead-time or demand regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history: arrivals are inconsistent with many prolonged missing arrivals earlier, but most recent confirmed arrivals show actual lead times of 2 (Period 4, Period 45) with occasional 1 and 3. On-hand=252, in-transit=656; pipeline is large but prior lost/delayed shipments show risk. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses evidence from concluded arrivals P4:2, P19:1, P26:3, P45:2 \u2192 avg 2.0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this keeps forecasting anchored to full historical demand while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time. This balances service (profit/higher q) vs holding cost given substantial on-hand and pipeline and the history of lost shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=112, in-transit=656. Recent concluded arrivals (Period 45) show shipments arriving with lead_time=2; earlier prolonged missing arrivals noted in carry-over but latest evidence supports using promised lead time. Demand recently spiked in late Nov/Dec (e.g., Period 42 demand=385) and recent sales when stocked were ~117\u2013140. To balance service vs holding cost I use promised L to let backend apply its lead-time, set mu_hat explicitly to reflect a 3-period (1+L) forecast of moderate-high weekly demand (~130/week \u21d2 3*130=390) and set sigma_hat explicitly to capture elevated volatility (~70) so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost.
