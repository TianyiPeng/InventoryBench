Profit per unit ($19) is very large relative to holding cost ($1), so overstocking is relatively cheap compared to lost profit from stockouts. OR's cap smooths ordering but would leave us deeply undersupplied (only 152 vs ~338 expected demand over the lead+current period). I therefore override OR and order enough to cover expected demand over the next (L+1) periods: round up \u03bc\u0302 to 338 units.

Therefore follow OR and place 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and to let in-transit deliveries arrive (or reveal losses) before committing more.

{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=1386. Promised L=2 so planning horizon = L+1 = 3 periods. Recent demand (Periods 41\u201346) = [126,385,111,105,117,140] \u2192 recent average \u2248164 units/week; 3-period demand \u2248 492 units. Pipeline (1386) comfortably exceeds 3-period demand and provides substantial buffer vs. recent spikes (e.g., 385). OR recommended 0 units; OR uses historical mean and promised lead time\u2014here actual pipeline already covers needs and there is no concluded evidence of further lead-time worsening or new demand regime beyond already recorded carry-over insight. Ordering now would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without increasing expected profit (marginal profit $19) sufficiently to justify extra inventory. Therefore place order = 0 and monitor future concludes for any lost shipments or unexpected lead-time changes.",
