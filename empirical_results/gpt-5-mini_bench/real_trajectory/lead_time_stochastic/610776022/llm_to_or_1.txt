Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 610776022 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (5 points: 53,132,222,242,233) show a recent upward demand trend but only 5 samples. Promised lead time is 2 periods and no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. To be conservative and let the OR backend compute base stock and caps using full-sample stats, use default lead time and default aggregate demand/volatility (backend will apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service level (captures observed demand mean/variance) vs holding cost without overfitting short sample noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand shows an upward regime (historical weekly samples: 53,132,222,242,233 and latest period demand=267, indicating higher recent demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (ordered P1) and P1 conclude shows arrived=0 which is consistent with promised lead time=2 (no evidence of lost shipments). Use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast, use recent_N on the most recent 5 samples to capture the rising regime. Volatility will use default (all-sample std scaled for (1+L)), letting the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost using the updated mean while keeping variance estimate broad.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent period demands (Period1=267, Period2=354) are higher than the older Jan samples but only two periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=666 equals the two outstanding orders (311+355) so no evidence of lost shipments; promised lead time 2 has not yet been contradicted by any conclude message. I choose default lead time to respect the contract and avoid premature adjustment. Demand forecast uses all historical samples (no confirmed changepoint) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the backend base-stock anchored to the long-run sample stats while the current pipeline (666 units) already exceeds the (1+L)-period expected demand, protecting against stockouts without aggressive extra ordering.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=786 (equals sum of orders 311+355+120). No arrivals have concluded for orders placed in Periods 1-3; expected arrivals by Period 3 conclude if promised L=2 did hold. This indicates actual lead time is longer than promised. I set L using explicit=3 to be conservative (captures observed multi-period delays). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) to rely on the full-sample mean given limited recent demand history. sigma_hat uses default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase target base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while letting the OR engine compute safety stock and respect caps; using explicit longer L prevents underordering when shipments are delayed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods: orders placed P1(311), P2(355), P3(120) totaling 786 have not concluded by Period 3 conclude.

610776022: ordered=260, arrived=355 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=355, demand=166, sold=166, ending on-hand inventory=189

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=189, in-transit=691. Concluded history shows Period 4 arrival: 355 units (ordered P2) with observed lead_time=2. Orders from P1 and P3 remain unconcluded (possible lost/delayed). Given the single confirmed observed lead_time=2, set L by calculation (average observed lead times=2). Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) for mu_hat and default volatility scaling for sigma_hat to rely on full historical sample stats while the shipment anomalies are not yet a sustained pattern (needs 3+ periods to record). These parameters balance service (using confirmed L=2) vs. holding cost by not overreacting to possibly lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=19, in-transit=691. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 4 reported arrived=355 (ordered Period 2) with lead_time=2. Orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unconcluded and may be delayed/lost, but concrete observed lead-time evidence supports using the average observed lead time. Set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand estimates use full sample history scaled by (1+L). This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, lead_time=2).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=740. Historical concluded arrivals show an observed lead time of 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4). No sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demands high (examples: 267,354,277,166,170,310) but not yet signaling a new regime. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence (method=calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while the calculated L corrects promised lead-time for ordering decisions and balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent realized weekly demand has risen (last 7 demands: 267,354,277,166,170,310,256) vs older samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=787 (matches outstanding orders). Concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4), so set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead window. Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent demand variation and produce a realistic safety stock for OR backend.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 2 (P2->P4, P6->P8) and 1 (P7->P8); average of the last 3 observed lead times \u22481.67 so I use recent_N to let backend average recent behaviour. Demand since Period 4 is persistently above pre-sample mean (P4\u2013P8 demands = 166,170,310,256,204; recent mean \u2248221) indicating a sustained higher regime, so I base mu_hat on the most recent 5 periods. Volatility also reflects the recent regime, so sigma_hat uses the same recent 5 samples. These settings help the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while letting the backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=777. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1} (mixed but mostly 2). Recent demand (last 5 periods: P5-P9) = [170,310,256,204,173], mean\u2248222.6 and elevated/volatile vs earlier baseline. To be responsive to the recent demand regime and the mixed but mainly 2-period lead-time evidence, I set L via recent_N on the last 3 observed lead times to capture the current effective lead-time trend. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using the last 5 demand samples to reflect the recent higher mean and variability; this drives the OR base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=691 (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2} (avg ~1.75) but majority=2; use calculated average for L to let backend infer actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the currently higher-demand regime while respecting the pipeline; this balances service level (capture elevated mean) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been high and volatile (recent weekly demands: 267,354,277,166,170,310,256,204,173,206,291). On-hand=0, in-transit=768 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier orders were delayed/lost; recent concluded arrivals indicate mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1. I choose to infer lead time from observed concludes (calculate) to let backend average actual observed lead times. Use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling to the full sample mean/std, keeping service level driven by profit/holding cost tradeoff. This balances avoiding stockouts given high recent demand while not overstating regime shifts based on limited inconsistent late arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=775. Observed concluded lead times: 2,2,1,2 (avg=1.75) \u2014 recent evidence supports ~2-period lead time. Recent demand has risen vs. older samples; last 5 concluded demands (P8-P12) = 204,173,206,291,278 (mean=230.4). To capture the current higher-demand regime, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times and base demand estimates on the last 5 periods. This yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast that raises target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while sigma estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Recent concluded arrivals indicate typical actual lead time \u22482 (some 1, one early 3 previously but majority 2). Demand over last 5 concluded periods (P9-P13) = [173,206,291,278,168], showing a recent mean around 223 with moderate variance. Use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let backend reconcile occasional 1-period arrival outliers. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime (last 5 demands) so base_stock and cap reflect current demand levels and variability while avoiding older pre-regime samples that are less relevant.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=2 for most delivered orders (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14) with a few isolated 1-period cases. Given this sustained evidence, choose to let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). Demand history shows no abrupt, sustained regime shift vs. historical samples\u2014use backend defaults for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (captures variability via observed lead time) against holding cost without over-adjusting to short-lived fluctuations. In-transit 748 will be reconciled by backend pipeline when computing order; no explicit correction for lost shipments is applied now.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=772. Historical concluded arrivals show predominant lead_time=2 (multiple orders: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14); occasional 1-period and earlier missing arrivals exist but recent sustained evidence supports LT=2. To let the OR backend use observed lead-time history, set L method=calculate (avg observed). Demand samples are limited to early 2019 weekly data; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit/holding gives q) while acknowledging large in-transit pipeline and prior delayed/lost shipments.

To avoid overreacting to intermittent 1-period arrivals or past lost shipments, use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock from all historical demand.

I choose L=default to use promised lead time, mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures recent ~202 mean) scaled by (1+L), and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Historical arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2), with recent periods mostly 1\u20132 and no sustained shift; demand has varied but most recent weeks better reflect current regime. I choose L as recent_N (N=5) to weight the latest observed lead-time samples. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent demand samples rather than the early 2019 spike. Sigma uses default to reflect overall historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (capture recent lead-time/demand behavior) against holding cost by avoiding overreaction to early high values.

On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: [2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,1] \u2192 avg\u22481.67. To reflect actual observed lead-time variability while letting backend compute demand across review+lead, set L to 'calculate' (use observed avg). Given substantial in-transit inventory and no clear sustained demand regime shift, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Recent demand has fallen vs early-year peaks, so use an EWMA to weight recent weeks more heavily when forecasting (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma as default (uses full-sample variability). Large in-transit stock reduces need for aggressive ordering; these parameters balance service level (through average lead time and EWMA demand) against holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded arrivals show mix of 1\u20132 period leads but Period 6 confirmed lead_time=2; I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly dropped in recent weeks (see Periods 20\u201324): I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower regime (reduces overstock risk). This balances service level (cover current week + lead) vs holding cost by forecasting based on the most recent 5 weeks of realized demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: avg demand in Periods 20\u201324 = 120 vs prior Periods15\u201319 avg = 202 (\u221241%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has shifted down starting Period 20 (Periods 20\u201324 avg=120 vs prior ~202); latest five weeks remain low (Periods 21\u201325: 143,129,106,70,52). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2; concluded arrivals historically show mainly 2-period behavior so use default promised L. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) which matches the detected regime length and captures current mean/volatility. This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given large in-transit stock while preserving service via pipeline coverage.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 20 (avg ~120 vs prior ~202). Lead-time evidence earlier confirmed typical actual lead time = 2 in prior periods. To reflect the new lower regime, I set demand forecasts using the most recent 5 periods to capture current lower mean and volatility. I keep the lead time at the promised/default so the OR engine uses its configured promised L while demand inputs reflect the regime shift; this balances service (avoid overstock from large in-transit) vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 20 (avg ~120 earlier then fell to ~70\u201335 most recent). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 with recent average \u22481.6. I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent realized lead-time behavior (N=5 -> avg \u22481.6). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 20\u201327, regime_length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use N=8 to reflect the sustained lower demand when computing (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (avoid overstock given long in-transit and low recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has undergone a sustained downshift since Period 20 (periods 20\u201328 avg \u2248 120 falling to ~48 in the most recent 5 weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline that likely covers several weeks). Observed concluded lead times cluster around 1\u20132 with average \u22481.625 \u2014 use calculate to reflect observed average rather than the promised 2. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=9 covers Periods 20\u201328) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and variability estimates, avoiding excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 20 (Periods 20\u201324 avg=120; Periods 25\u201329 avg\u224840). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 and promised lead time is 2. To avoid overstating demand we set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 weeks (the new low-demand regime) while leaving L at default (promised=2). This reduces target base stock to match the sustained lower demand and prevents excessive holding given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1s and 2s) with recent evidence averaging >1.5 periods; demand has clearly shifted down starting ~Period 20 and recent 5-week mean is low (~36\u201343 units). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 period mix). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (weights most recent weeks, avoiding stale higher pre-period-20 demands). This keeps base_stock aligned with current low demand while in-transit stock (748) will prevent immediate stockouts; lower mu_hat reduces excess holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand regime is the lower level starting Period 20 (sustained through Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (no new conclude messages since P31 so arrivals unknown this decision). Lead-time observations earlier are mixed (1\u20132), but the promised lead time is 2 and recent conclues confirm 2 as plausible; no sustained shift in lead time to justify changing L. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). For demand I use a recent_N estimate focused on the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 20\u201331): mu_hat -> recent_N with N=12 to capture the new lower mean over the last 12 periods. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent variance. These settings bias the OR backend toward lower replenishment consistent with the sustained drop in demand while keeping lead-time conservative to avoid stockouts from in-transit uncertainty.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in the lower post-change regime since Period 20 (periods 20\u201332 average much lower than earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times centered on 2 periods (evidence in conclude messages), so let backend compute average observed lead time. To avoid overstocking given large pipeline and lower recent demand, forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime. Choices: L by calculate to capture observed lead-time history; mu_hat recent_N with N=13 to base (1+L)-period demand on the 13 most recent low-demand samples (Periods 20\u201332); sigma_hat recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent lower volatility. This reduces target base_stock to match the sustained lower demand while allowing the OR engine to account for observed lead-time behavior and the existing large in-transit pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 with some 1s; average of observed lead times \u22481.67. To avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline and low recent demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend use average \u22481.67). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the latest low-demand regime (last 5 weeks), limiting orders despite pipeline. This balances service (small safety stock for short lead) versus holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

Observed lead times in concluded history are mixed (mostly 2, some 1) so I let the backend compute the empirical average (method=calculate) to capture that mix; demand exhibits a sustained downshift starting Period 20 already recorded, so use default demand/statistics aggregation (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). These choices let the OR engine set base-stock while the calculated L accounts for historical LT variability and default mu/sigma respect the documented regime-change data for service/holding tradeoff.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 20 (Periods 20\u201336 average demand much lower than pre-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 but history shows occasional longer/shorter arrivals; use promised lead time to let OR backend assume 2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=17 (Periods 20\u201336) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; this keeps target base-stock low while the large pipeline prevents stockouts. This balances service level (use recent demand) versus holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 20 (weekly demands mostly 35\u219238\u219225 range recently). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline\u2014may include delayed earlier orders). Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed concluded lead times (history shows mostly 1\u20132 periods with some 2s confirmed). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (regime from Period 20\u201337, N = min(regime_length,20)=18) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent mean across the review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=18 to capture recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the sustained low-demand regime while letting the backend account for observed lead-time behavior and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excessive new ordering and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in the lower regime confirmed starting Period 20 (sustained through Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with promised lead_time=2 historically. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (backend expects 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 20\u201338) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean, reducing overstocks given high pipeline. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=19 to reflect recent volatility. These choices lower target base stock to balance service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 and large in-transit quantity.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 20 (weeks 20\u201339) with much lower weekly demand than earlier periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=748 which is ample to cover upcoming demand and suggests no immediate replenishment needed. Promised lead time remains 2 (no new lead-time evidence). I set L to default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (latest 20 samples). For volatility I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices steer the OR backend to a lower base-stock aligned with the confirmed lower demand while accounting for recent variability; given large in-transit stock this avoids unnecessary new orders and holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,1} \u2192 average \u22481.67; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior rather than the promised 2. No strong recent demand changepoint beyond the previously recorded regime shift (Periods 20\u201324). Use default demand/statistics (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend can compute base_stock and the capped order given the inferred lead time; this balances service (profit=$4) against holding cost ($1).

Promised lead time is 2; historical concludes confirm lead time=2 in multiple periods. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised = 2) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using the last 20 samples (captures the post-change lower mean and volatility), reducing base-stock targets and holding costs while maintaining service given the observed regime.

Use promised lead time (default=2) since concluded history mostly supports L=2. Forecast demand using recent_N to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (N=5 = last 5 samples). Use recent_N for sigma to capture current low volatility. These parameters avoid inflating orders given the large in-transit stock while matching the lower recent demand to reduce holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=748. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (mostly 2, some 1); averaging concluded lead times is appropriate. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 20 (recent weeks very low), so forecast should use the most recent samples. To avoid overstocking given large in-transit and lower recent demand, I use: L='calculate' (avg observed lead times), mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current low-demand regime, and sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent low volatility. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock tied to observed lead-time behavior while grounding demand and volatility on the latest 5 weeks to limit excess ordering against the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Given large pipeline and very low recent demand, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods to avoid overstock. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) keeps target base-stock aligned to current low demand and reduces holding cost exposure while letting backend cap orders given pipeline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 20 (weekly demands now single- to low-double digits). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks of current low demand, so avoid inflating stock. Lead time historically shows mostly 2 periods in concluded arrivals; use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile mixed 1\u20132 observations. For demand forecast use recent_N over the latest low-demand regime to capture the sustained drop (use a long recent window capped by rules). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=20) to reflect the low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N to reflect current volatility. This balances service (keep some safety stock) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 20 (sustained drop confirmed P20\u201324 and many low weeks afterward). On-hand=0, in-transit=748 (large pipeline; risk of arrivals or losses). Recent observed weekly demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [22, 6, 3, 8, 5], so I forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low-demand regime. Promised lead time remains 2 and recent concluded lead-time evidence is mixed but previously confirmed as 2; use default promised L to keep OR engine consistent. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) focuses the base-stock on current low demand, reducing holding costs given the large in-transit balance.
