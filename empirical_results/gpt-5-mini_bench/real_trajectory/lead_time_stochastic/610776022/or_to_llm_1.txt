To balance stockout risk versus holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile 0.8), I increase the order above the OR cap but remain conservative to limit holding: order 360 units (\u2248 +16% above OR) to better cover the higher recent demand while avoiding excessive inventory if the surge softens.",
