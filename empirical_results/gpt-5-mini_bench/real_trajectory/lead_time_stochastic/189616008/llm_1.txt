Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead time has been variable (observed 1\u20133 periods) and some orders have been delayed/lost historically; treat in-transit=754 as unreliable but substantial if it arrives. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=754 \u2014 even if some of that is delayed or lost, the quantity is large relative to expected weekly demand. Decision logic: because in-transit is large and ordering now faces promised 2-period lead time (with past variability) while holding cost is $1/unit/period, avoid adding inventory ahead of an expected post-holiday demand drop. Ordering 0 minimizes holding cost risk while relying on the large in-transit pipeline; monitor next conclude for actual arrivals and adjust if pipeline fails to deliver.",
