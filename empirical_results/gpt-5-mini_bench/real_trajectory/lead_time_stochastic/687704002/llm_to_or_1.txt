Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a sharp upward shift (0,0,26,111,277) with last three samples (26,111,277) indicating a new higher regime. Use promised lead time (default L=2) since no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the rapid increase ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts for the apparent new demand level while keeping variance estimate focused on the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: avg increased from 0 to 138 units (based on last 3-week mean = 138)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime (2019-01-21..2019-02-04, recent 3-week mean=138). On-hand=0, in-transit=348 (ordered Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so do not infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time to let OR engine assume L=2. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher mean (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples = 3*138). For volatility, use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent sample variation. These parameters prioritize service (meet elevated demand) while keeping holding cost moderate by relying on a short recent window.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded demands: Period1=266, Period2=158, prior samples show a regime shift in late Jan/early Feb. On-hand=0, in-transit=719 (orders placed recently may still be en route and not yet visible). No concluded arrivals past promised lead time, so do not override promised lead time. Choose L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime (captures the last few weeks of elevated demand). Use sigma_hat default to let backend scale variability from all samples while accounting for (1+L) aggregation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent demand regime (periods around 2019-01-21..2019-02-04) shows elevated demand (3-week mean=138). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1041 (matches ordered totals in P1-P3). Concluded history shows ordered in Periods 1-3 (348, 371, 322) but arrived=0 each conclude \u2192 evidence of delayed or lost shipments. To be conservative I explicitly increase lead time to 3 periods to account for persistent delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new, higher regime (use last 3 demand samples). For sigma I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window given confirmed higher demand while acknowledging delivery risk so the OR backend will size orders to protect service level without excessive added variance assumptions.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered=348,371,322; total=1041) have not arrived by their respective conclude messages \u2192 likely delayed/lost shipments; treat lead time as longer than promised until contrary evidence.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=254, in-transit=670; observed concluded arrival shows Period 2 order had lead_time=2 (matches promised), while Periods 1 and 3 orders remain unarrived (possible lost/delayed). Use L=calculate to reflect the average of observed lead times (evidence=observed lead_time=2). Demand has shifted recently (higher in P1 then settling); use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest stable regime (Periods 2-4 demand = 158,115,117) so base-stock covers (1+L) periods of near-term demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand elevated since 2019-01-21; last 5 observed demands (Periods 1-5) = [266,158,115,117,89]. On-hand=165, in-transit=670 but arrivals have been irregular: Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2, but orders from Period1 and Period3 remain unconfirmed. To balance service vs holding cost I set lead time based on observed lead times (use calculated average to let backend infer from history) and use a recent-5 demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older zero-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time irregularity persists: orders from Period1 (348 units) and Period3 (322 units) remain unarrived by Period6 conclude; evidence of delayed/lost shipments \u2014 treat lead time as longer/uncertain until contrary evidence.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=69, in-transit=670, profit=$19, holding=$1. Historical concl: Period4 shows an observed lead_time=2 (Period2 order); Period1 and Period3 orders remain unarrived -> evidence of irregular/longer lead times. Demand stabilized since the regime shift (Periods4-6) at roughly ~100 units/week (117,89,96). To guard against further delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent 3-week demand (Periods4-6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new, lower-stable regime; this focuses stocking on observed current demand while avoiding overreaction to older zeros.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent selling shows elevated post-Jan demand but has softened from peak: recent demands (Periods 4-7) = [117,89,96,109], mean=102.75. On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Concluded arrivals show one order (Period2) had lead_time=2; orders from Period1 and Period3 remain unarrived (possible losses/delays). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (we have confirmed a 2-period arrival); use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent regime (captures current average demand \u2248103 and recent variability) and avoid overweighting the sparse early-zero samples. This approach protects against overstating demand from early one-off spikes while acknowledging irregular arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent weeks show elevated demand vs earlier zeros (recent samples: 26,111,277) and pipeline=670 with two earlier orders (P1,P3) still unarrived while P2 confirmed lead_time=2. Missing arrivals suggest shipment risk but only one confirmed lead-time=2 observation\u2014insufficient to change lead-time estimate. Set L to promised (default) so backend uses promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses the last 3 demand samples) so base stock reflects the recent jump while limiting exposure to older zero-demand weeks. This balances service level (covering the new demand spike) against holding cost given inventory currently in-transit and potential lost shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been elevated and fairly stable over the last 6 periods (Period4-9 mean \u2248107.5/week). Several earlier orders remain unarrived (Periods 1 and 3), so lead time is uncertain and likely longer than the promised 2; be conservative. I set L explicit=3 to buffer for delayed/lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-regime elevated mean over the last 6 observed weeks ((1+L) multiplier applied by backend). Sigma uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given uncertain/delayed arrivals) while using recent demand to limit excess holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Historical concludes show irregular arrivals: Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2, but orders from Period1 and Period3 remain unarrived through Period10 conclude \u2192 lead time is uncertain/longer than promised; risk of lost/delayed shipments. I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative given persistent delays. Recent demand has shifted up since Jan; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (periods 6-10 demand = 96,109,137,97,87) so the backend computes base stock over (1+L) periods using current demand mean/volatility. This increases coverage for delayed arrivals while keeping holding cost in check by relying on recent demand statistics rather than all-time historical lows.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has averaged ~100 units/week over the last 8 concluded periods (Periods 4\u201311). Promised lead time is 2 and observed concluded lead time (one confirmed arrival) is 2; although some earlier shipments remain missing, evidence is mixed so I keep promised lead time. To cover current + lead periods I use (1+L)=3 review+lead coverage based on the most recent 8 demand samples to reflect the post-shift regime while keeping variability estimated from the same window.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. History shows one confirmed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Several earlier orders remain unconfirmed (delayed/lost) but we will use observed concluded lead times only. Recent demand (Period4\u2013Period12: 117,89,96,109,137,97,87,67,94) averages \u224899\u2014this is our near-term demand regime. To balance service level (profit $19 vs hold $1 \u2192 high service target) and avoid excess holding given uncertain arrivals, I set L by calculation (uses observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 (last 9 concluded demand periods) to capture the current lower post-spike demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine sizes orders to meet (1+L)-period demand with appropriate safety stock while limiting holding risk given in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Historical concludes show one confirmed lead time =2 (Period4: order from P2 arrived with lead_time 2) but large orders from Periods 1 and 3 (348,322) remain unarrived through Period13 conclude\u2014this is sustained (>> promised L=2) and suggests longer/uncertain lead time or lost shipments. Demand peaked earlier ( Periods 3-5 ) then settled lower in recent weeks; recent 5-period mean is materially below the earlier spike. To protect service given uncertain arrivals, I explicitly increase assumed L to capture delayed shipments, and use recent_N demand estimates (last 5 periods) to reflect the current lower-demand regime. sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same recent window so safety stock reflects current variability rather than the earlier spike.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed longer/uncertain: orders from Period1 (348 units) and Period3 (322 units) remain unarrived through Period13 conclude (ordered on P1 and P3, >10 periods since P1), indicating shipments delayed or lost; treat lead time as longer than promised until contrary evidence.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Recent demand (Periods 4\u201314) averages ~92 units/week (11 samples) after the early Jan\u2013Feb regime shift. In-transit=670 matches two earlier unarrived orders (P1,P3) indicating delayed shipments, but we have one observed arrival with lead_time=2 (P2->arrived in P4). Use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times = 2). Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-shift demand regime (1+L=3 review+lead coverage will be applied by backend). This balances service (cover ~3 weeks of current demand) against holding cost given low holding penalty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Historical concl. messages show one observed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4) while orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unarrived\u2014evidence of delayed/lost shipments but only one clean lead-time observation exists, so set L by calculating observed lead times (use backend average). Demand has fallen from the earlier spike; recent weeks (Periods 9\u201315) show lower, more stable demand (97,87,67,94,47,75,56). To reflect the recent lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) so the OR backend focuses on the latest demand pattern while accounting for pipeline. This balances service level (use observed lead-time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit units and uncertain older orders.

Recent demand (last 10 concluded weeks) averaged ~88 units/week with moderate variability. To protect service while accounting for prolonged delivery uncertainty, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised (L=6) so the OR backend builds pipeline for a longer coverage window. I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest (post-spike) demand regime and recent volatility, avoiding overweighting the Jan\u2013Feb spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical concluded messages show persistent missing/delayed arrivals (orders from P1 and P3 never concluded) indicating lead-time uncertainty; one order (P2) did conclude with lead_time=2, so variability exists. Demand has settled lower after the early high spike; recent 6-week demand (Periods 12-17) is representative. To protect service given uncertain/delayed shipments, I explicitly lengthen lead time estimate while using recent data for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine orders enough pipeline cover without over-reacting to older spikes.

======================================================================

Historical conclues show one confirmed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) but many earlier orders never concluded (P1,P3 etc.), indicating persistent delayed/lost arrivals; however the only confirmed observed lead time samples average to ~2. Recent demand (Periods 13\u201318 = 47,75,56,48,47,39) is lower than the early spike. To balance service and holding cost I use an empirically estimated lead time (calculate) based on observed concluces, and base demand estimates on the recent 6 periods to reflect the post-spike regime while keeping variability measured on the same window so the OR engine can size safety stock appropriately given the uncertain pipeline (in-transit=698).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical demand shows an early spike (late Jan/Feb) then a lower recent regime: last 7 concluded weekly demands = [47,75,56,48,47,39,33] (declining but centered ~50). Multiple prior shipments were delayed/lost (orders from P1/P3 remained unarrived through P14), so treat lead time as longer/uncertain than promised. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative vs. promised 2 (accounts for observed delays). For demand I use recent_N N=7 to capture the current lower-demand regime across the (1+L) review+lead window. For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders toward covering the next (1+L) periods of measured recent demand while accounting for longer lead times and avoiding overstock given holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has settled well below the early spike: last 8 weeks (P13\u2013P20) mean demand = 45.625 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=698 but multiple past shipments remained unarrived for many periods \u2192 treat lead time as longer/uncertain. I set L explicitly longer than the promised 2 to guard against further unseen delays (L=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the new lower regime (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering against possibly lost shipments while covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand.

Many earlier orders remain unobserved but lack additional conclude evidence; therefore use promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks\u2014last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 17-21) average \u224833 units/week. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the reduced recent demand and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Recent observed demand has been low and stable over the last several weeks (recent demands: 27,39,24, etc.), so I use a recent-window forecast. Choices: L explicit=10 to reflect extended/uncertain lead time and to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover; mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent 7 weeks; sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical conclues show persistent missing/delayed arrivals (orders from early periods remained unarrived through Period 14 and beyond), so actual lead time appears longer/uncertain than the promised 2. Recent demand has settled at low weekly levels (last several weeks: 27,39,24,14). To avoid stockouts from delayed shipments, set lead time explicitly longer. Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the recent low-demand regime (short window). Choices: L explicit=3 to allow extra buffer vs. promised 2; mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture recent 7 weeks' mean scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters increase the base-stock slightly to protect service against delayed arrivals while keeping holding costs low given weak demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical concludes show persistent missing/delayed arrivals (multiple orders never concluded) despite one observed arrival with lead_time=2; evidence supports treating lead time as longer/uncertain. I set L explicitly longer than promised to force the OR engine to cover additional pipeline/delay risk. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-samples) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history\u2014this leverages all available demand data while the explicit L inflates the review+lead demand coverage to protect service given uncertain arrivals. This balances service level (avoid stockouts from delayed shipments) vs holding cost by relying on historical demand stats for variability and increasing lead time only to the degree needed to cover likely delays.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical conclues show many overdue/lost arrivals (orders from early periods never concluded) so actual lead time is uncertain and clearly longer than promised; be conservative. Use explicit L=10 to cover extended/unknown delays. Recent demand (most recent 12 weeks: P15\u2013P26) shows a sustained lower post-spike regime; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=12 to focus the forecast on the current regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect current volatility rather than legacy spike variability. These settings bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while acknowledging delayed shipments and limiting excess holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical concluded lead times: one confirmed arrival (order on P2 arrived with lead_time=2) but multiple earlier orders never concluded indicating lost/delayed shipments; overall lead-time is uncertain. Recent demand (Periods 17-27) shows a stable lower-volume regime versus the early spike in Feb\u2013Mar. I choose L explicit=3 to be conservative given persistent missing arrivals (promised=2 but some shipments delayed/lost). For demand I use recent_N (N=11, periods 17\u201327) to capture the current lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders to cover slightly longer lead times while sizing base-stock from the recent, lower-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demand has settled lower (~20\u201375 units, recent volatility moderate) after the early-2019 spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=698; several earlier orders remain unconfirmed long past promised LT \u2192 treat LT as longer/uncertain. I set L explicitly above the promised 2 to be conservative. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 10 weeks to capture the current lower regime and recent variability; this balances service level versus holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 which matches unarrived orders (P1=348, P3=322, P17=28) \u2014 multiple shipments remain missing/very delayed. One concluded arrival (P4 showed P2 arrived with lead_time=2) but many older orders never concluded, so effective lead time appears longer/uncertain. To protect service while acknowledging recent realized weekly demand (most recent 8 concluded weeks show moderate demand ~44/wk), set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (conservative vs promised 2). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current post-shift demand regime (reduces overweighting of early large spike). These choices increase pipeline cover for the longer/uncertain lead time and use recent demand volatility to set safety stock, balancing profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weekly demand has averaged moderate values (many weeks of single- to double-digit demand since Feb); on-hand=0, in-transit=698. Concluded history provides one explicit observed lead time = 2 (Period4 concluded: P2 order lead_time=2); multiple earlier orders remained unarrived for many periods, suggesting irregular/delayed shipments but no additional concluded lead-time data. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (reflecting the confirmed 2-period observation) rather than blindly trusting the promise; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the full-sample forecast and volatility given limited confirmed changepoints. This balances service level (use observed lead time) with holding cost (no explicit inflation of mean/variance without stronger evidence).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (sums orders from P1=348, P3=322, P17=28). History shows one concluded arrival with lead_time=2 (order P2 arrived in P4) while orders from P1 and P3 remain unarrived \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments but limited concluded lead-time samples. I set L using calculate (average of observed lead times = 2) to reflect the single confirmed 2-period arrival. Demand has been in a lower, stable regime since Period 17 (recent weekly demands ~47\u219248); I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=15 (Periods 17\u201331) to capture the current regime for the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast. Volatility will use default (all-sample based) to avoid overfitting to short swings. These choices keep service level aligned to confirmed lead-time evidence while using recent demand to avoid over/under-stocking given uncertain in-transit status.

Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, In-transit=698. Persistent missing arrivals (orders from early periods never concluded; >10 periods elapsed) indicate actual lead time is longer/uncertain than promised. Set L explicitly to 10 to reflect prolonged/uncertain lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand from Period 8\u201332 is stable/moderate; use recent_N (last 20 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows a sustained post-spike lower-demand regime (weekly demands mostly 20\u201390) and persistent missing/delayed arrivals earlier; in-transit = 698. Only observed concluded lead_time is 2 (Period2\u2192Period4), but many earlier orders never concluded, so keep lead time estimation data-driven. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (backs the single confirmed 2-period observation while allowing backend to update if more concludes appear). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 20 weeks (captures the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility), which balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit volume and holding cost sensitivity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical concludes show severe arrival irregularities and long-delayed/lost shipments (multiple earlier orders never concluded), so treat lead time as longer/uncertain than promised. I set L explicit=3 to hedge against delayed arrivals. Demand has been stable since the post-Jan regime shift; to reflect recent realized demand (last several months) I use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the latest 20 weekly demands multiplied by (1+L). I keep sigma_hat default to let the backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to protect service (avoid stockouts given uncertain shipments) while not overstating variance-driven safety stock.

History shows P2 arrived with lead_time=2 but multiple orders never concluded for many periods \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative, set explicit lead time longer than promised to force larger pipeline cover.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weekly demand settled in the 30\u201390 range after the early 2019 spike; last 20 concluded weeks show stable, lower demand compared with the initial spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (large pipeline from past orders; several early orders remain unarrived in conclude history suggesting some lost/delayed shipments, but only one concluded arrival gives an observed lead time=2). I set L=calculate to use the average of observed conclude lead times (reflects confirmed data while remaining conservative about unconfirmed delays). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the recent, stable regime and avoid overweighting the early spike; this yields (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed over the last 20 samples. These choices balance service (use recent demand to size base stock) while avoiding overstock from the early spike and accounting for observed lead-time evidence.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand has been ~50\u201390 with a recent 10-week mean \u224864.1 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (large pipeline from prior orders that may be delayed/lost). Historical conclues show persistent missing/delayed shipments earlier; treat lead time as longer than promised to avoid under-ordering. Set L explicit=4 to cover additional uncertainty beyond promised 2. For demand, use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current post-regime demand level (1+L periods of coverage will be applied by backend). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward covering (1+L)\xd7recent mean while letting the OR backend compute safety stock via profit/holding tradeoff and cap constraints.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical conclude messages show one observed lead_time=2 (Period2 arrival in Period4) while several early orders never concluded\u2014lead time appears irregular but only one concluded sample exists, so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (last several weeks) is higher and more relevant than the sparse early samples; use recent_N (N=8) to capture current demand level and variability over the latest 8 weeks. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to current demand while using observed lead-time data rather than the default promised value; using recent demand reduces stockouts from underestimated demand and avoids excessive holding by not overreacting to long-unconfirmed historical spikes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand (Periods 33-39) shows elevated weekly demand (86,81,52,82,93,60,51; mean ~73). Historical conclude data includes one observed lead time = 2 (order on P2 arrived in P4); other earlier orders appear lost/delayed but no new concluded evidence changing lead-time estimate. To balance service and holding cost: use calculated average lead time from observed concludes (stable=2), use recent demand window to capture the current regime, and use recent volatility for Sigma to reflect current variability. These settings aim to cover (1+L) periods of demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical conclues show persistent delayed/lost arrivals (orders from P1 and P3 never concluded) so treat lead time as longer than promised. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative against missed shipments. Demand has stabilized since early spikes; I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 20 weekly demand observations (most representative recent regime) so the OR backend will size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given uncertain/longer lead time and sizeable in-transit) versus holding cost sensitivity (holding cost low relative to profit).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=698. Historical conclude messages show one confirmed arrival with lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and many delayed/uncertain shipments earlier; therefore use observed lead-time average rather than default. Demand has been stable in recent months (weekly demands ~20\u201393); to capture current regime use a recent-window estimate. Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 20 demand samples to reflect the current demand level and volatility, which keeps the base-stock reactive to recent demand while limiting inventory given holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Many earlier orders failed to conclude, but only concluded lead-time evidence is Period2\u2192Period4 (lead_time=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 which likely covers several weeks. Given limited confirmed lead-time data, use calculated average lead time from observed concludes (=2). No strong sustained recent demand regime change beyond historical variability, so use default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use observed lead time) while avoiding overcommitting inventory given uncertain/lost shipments.

Historical conclues show one confirmed lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) but multiple missing/very-delayed arrivals earlier\u2014evidence of irregular/longer lead times. Recent weekly demand (last 12 periods) is the best indicator of near-term demand; use recent_N=12 to capture current regime without over-weighting old sparse periods. Set L explicit=3 to be conservative given persistent delayed/lost shipments. Choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level against holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand over the review+lead horizon while guarding versus shipment delays.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (sum of outstanding orders P1=348, P3=322, P17=28) \u2014 P1 and P3 have never concluded despite many periods elapsed, and P17 (small) also remains unarrived. This indicates missing/delayed shipments; use explicit longer lead time to avoid underestimating pipeline. Demand recent weeks (last ~20 periods) show stable mid-range weekly demand (~30\u201390) with occasional spikes; use recent_N for mu_hat to capture current regime and avoid dilution by early zero-demand samples. sigma_hat left as default to reflect overall observed variability. Choices: L explicit=6 to reflect prolonged/uncertain shipments (longer than promised 2); mu_hat recent_N N=20 to forecast (1+L)-period demand from recent regime; sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full history. These settings bias orders upward in pipeline to cover delayed arrivals while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent demand variability, balancing lost-sales cost (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weekly demand has been moderate with a small uptick in late Nov/Dec (recent demands: 119,39,38,51,64). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand but past history shows delayed/lost shipments; only one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (evidence: Period4 conclude: order on P2 arrived with lead_time=2) while remaining responsive to any future confirmed shifts. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the latest regime (captures last ~8 weeks including recent uptick) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 8 samples). For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent variability. These settings balance service (using recent demand) vs holding cost (pipeline is already large and will cap ordering).
