Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (90,75,152,112,142) show no sustained regime change (last 5 weeks mean ~114). On-hand and in-transit are 0, so we need coverage for current review + lead period. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=339, recent conclude messages show no arrivals yet for orders placed in P1/P2 but those would only conclude after promised L=2; no confirmed lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (90,75,152,112,142) give mean=114.2 and sd\u224832.9. I will use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility scaling so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample stats while remaining conservative about unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks through 2019-02-04) show mean ~114.2/week and std ~29.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=486 (orders placed in P1-P3 have not concluded as arrivals). No concluded arrivals in history => cannot confirm actual lead time or declare lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and historical demand to seed the OR engine: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps parameters conservative given large pipeline and avoids prematurely adjusting for unconfirmed lead-time changes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3230.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent realized demand has risen: Period1-4 demands = 138,180,180,203 (uptrend). On-hand=0, in-transit=342 \u2014 pipeline large and should cover upcoming (1+L) periods, but earlier orders show some missing arrivals (P1 order never concluded). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual lead time (observed P2\u2192P4 => 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the upward shift in demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These settings increase the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while using observed lead time to avoid under-ordering given past delayed/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4, observed lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=562; recent weeks show elevated demand (P1-5 demands = [138,180,180,203,137]) vs older samples. Lead time confirmed as 2 in prior period; use promised/default L=2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures current higher mean and variance), which balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=53, in-transit=366. Concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1; recent evidence shows lead time variable so use recent average to adapt (N=2 \u2192 L\u22481.5). Use default demand/volatility to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service versus holding given high pipeline and modest holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=489. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P2->P4 = 2, P5->P6 = 1). I use a recent average for lead time to capture this variability. Demand has increased since the Jan samples; recent periods (P3\u2013P7) show higher mean, so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent 5 demand samples to reflect the current regime and higher volatility. This balances service (higher base stock) vs holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=429. Observed concluded lead times vary (W observed = 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5) so I use calculate to let backend set L based on observed lead times. Recent demand has been elevated/volatile (last 5 period demands: 203,137,167,140,215); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime. This yields (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility focused on the latest demand pattern, improving service during variable lead times while limiting excess holding given $1 holding vs $19 profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=619. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) and historical demand samples are limited but pre-season spring apparel shows steady weekly demand. In-transit volume is already large, so I keep the promised lead time to avoid over-correcting for noisy lead-time observations. I select default demand and volatility computations so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=122, in-transit=342. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1] (six observations), indicating variability but a clear average ~1.5. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand has recently averaged ~161.6 over the last 5 concluded demand periods (Periods 6-10 = 167,140,215,131,155), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime. I keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (using recent demand and inferred lead-time average) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: observed lead_times by conclude messages = Period4:2, Period6:1, Period8:2, Period8:1, Period10:2, Period10:1 (six observations); average lead_time = 1.5 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=473 (large pipeline but arrivals not yet concluded). Historical concluded lead times show variability (recent observed sequence length=6, avg\u22481.5), so I use recent_N for L to capture that recent mix. Recent demand has shifted up vs. earlier Jan samples (last 6 demands: P6-P11 = 167,140,215,131,155,154; mean\u2248160). To reflect the newer higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent regime. This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost given large in-transit stock and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows volatile but elevated weekly demand (recent demands: 138,180,180,203,137,167,140,215,131,155,154,186) and many in-transit units (566) with on-hand=0. Observed concluded lead times vary (periods show 1 and 2) \u2014 average ~1.5. Some recent orders (e.g., Period12 ordered=93) have not yet arrived, so shipment loss/delay is possible. I choose L by 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations). For demand I select 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the long-run sample mean across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat='default' to use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (profit >> holding cost so q high) while relying on observed lead-time variability and large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=435. Historical concluded lead-times (multiple periods) average \u22481.5 and show variability; pipeline is large but arrivals are observed with mixed 1\u20132 period delays. To reflect observed lead-time variability I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses the empiric average of observed lead times. Demand samples provided are limited; I'll use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the full-sample statistics scaled by the inferred review+lead horizon. This balances service (using higher effective L) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=471 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (six observations, avg 1.5). Recent demand has stepped up (last 5 concluded demands: 155,154,186,189,257) \u2014 higher mean and volatility vs. earlier samples. I set L to recent_N (N=6) to reflect observed lead-time variability (avg ~1.5). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the recent higher-demand regime (covers review+lead in backend). These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while recognizing existing large in-transit stock; using recent samples reduces underforecast risk from the demand spike and captures increased volatility to raise safety stock appropriately.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=684; recent demand has risen (most recent 5 demands: 154,186,189,257,174 -> mean=192). Lead-time observations show variability with recent average ~1.5 (six observed concludes). I set L using recent_N=6 to reflect the empirically observed lead-time average (captures 1-2 period variability). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demand samples, capturing the recent upward regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand samples. These choices bias inventory upward to avoid stockouts given observed higher recent demand and lead-time variability while containing overstock by using only recent data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent demand has increased vs earlier history (see carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=687 \u2014 substantial pipeline but lead time observations show variability (avg ~1.5). I choose L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures 1.5 avg). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand in Periods 12-16 (avg ~191.4) rather than long-run mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the recent higher demand while the pipeline provides cover; using recent stats limits overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg demand increased from 163.6 (Periods 1-11) to 191.4 (Periods 12-16), +17%

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=127, in-transit=472 (pipeline well-stocked). Historical concludes show mixed lead times (avg ~1.5) and a sustained demand regime shift up at Period 12 (mean \u2248191.4 over P12-16). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed-average lead time (captures variability vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 12-16) to reflect the higher post-changepoint mean (191.4) across the review+lead horizon. Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet the new higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods; using recent samples helps balance service level vs holding cost given a large current pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 12-16 avg up ~17% vs Periods 1-11). Pipeline high: on-hand=35, in-transit=563; several past shipments arrived on-time but lead times have varied between 1\u20132 periods. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 14-18 / the post-shift regime) to anchor mu_hat to the higher regime; N=5 balances recency with sample size. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility during the new regime. These settings increase forecasted (1+L) demand to support service during higher demand while letting the backend compute safety stock consistent with profit vs holding cost and observed lead-time variability.

Historical conclude messages show lead-time variability (observed avg ~1.5) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 12 (+17% vs P1-11).

For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 12-19) to reflect the new higher-demand regime while keeping variance estimation recent. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit; using recent samples avoids inflating forecasts from older low-demand periods.

Observed concluded lead times show variability (avg ~1.5) but still centered near 1\u20132. To capture the recent higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime (last 9 samples, Periods 12\u201320). For lead time I request the backend calculate the average of all observed lead times so the pipeline estimate reflects observed variability. These choices bias orders upward to meet the sustained higher demand while letting the backend's cap limit exposure to holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Focus demand estimate on recent behavior: use recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent regime samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the post-change higher mean and recent volatility while avoiding overstating safety stock given high pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 17-23 = 7 samples: 89,92,93,117,90,93,56) averages ~90 units/week; demand since Period 12 showed a prior +17% regime shift but the last 7 periods reverted to a lower level, so use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7) to reflect current run-rate. Use recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. These settings keep orders responsive to current lower demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits additional ordering risk.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=566 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (avg ~1.5) and a sustained demand uplift detected earlier (Period 12+). Recent realized demand (last 5 periods: P20-24 = 117,90,93,56,47) is markedly lower and more volatile than the earlier elevated regime, so I prioritize short-term recent demand to avoid overstock given high pipeline. I let the backend compute L from observed lead-time concludes (method=calculate) to reflect measured variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility across the review+lead period; this keeps orders conservative while the large in-transit volume fills near-term demand. These choices balance service (using observed lead-time stats) against holding cost exposure from the sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Recent concludes show mixed lead-times but last 3 observed lead_time samples = {2,2,1} \u2192 avg ~1.67; demand has dropped sharply in Periods 21-25 (90,93,56,47,43). To protect service vs low holding cost and reflect the new low-demand regime, I set L to recent_N (N=3) to bias lead-time estimate toward latest observations, and forecast demand using recent_N over the last 5 periods (Periods 21-25). Sigma uses recent_N over the same 5 periods to capture recent reduced volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess inventory while acknowledging slightly shorter recent lead-times and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand fell to 65.8 (Periods 21-25) from prior regime avg 191.4 (Periods 12-16), change = -66.6%

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (carry-over: avg fell to ~65.8). Observed lead-time conclusions show variability (avg ~1.5). On-hand=5, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). To reflect shorter effective lead-time from observations while letting backend compute the average, set L via 'calculate' (uses observed lead times). Demand forecast should reflect the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (captures most recent 5 demand observations). Volatility also set to recent_N N=5 to reflect current lower variance. These choices reduce orders relative to historical highs, avoid overstocking given large in-transit, and align safety stock with recent demand and lead-time evidence.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (avg ~65.8 for P21-25 and continued low values P26-27). Lead times have been variable; recent concluded observations average ~1.5 periods (evidence in conclude messages). To be responsive to the new low-demand regime I set lead-time estimate using the recent observed lead times (N=6) and base demand on the most recent regime (use last 7 demand samples, P21-27) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility is likewise computed from the same recent 7-sample window. These choices reduce overstock risk given the clear drop in demand while still accounting for observed lead-time variability and pipeline in-transit units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has settled into the low regime that began at Period 21 (avg ~65.8 through Period 25, and continued low in P26-28 with demands 32,47,46). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 529 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have been variable (history shows 1\u20133 periods; prior carry-over reports average ~1.5). To avoid artificially inflating orders given the large pipeline and sustained low-demand regime, use a lead-time estimate based on observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecast use a recent_N estimate focused on the low-demand regime (N=8 covers Periods 21\u201328) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand; use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of over-ordering while the backend computes base-stock and applies the cap.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) and recent long gaps; use backend's observed-average for L (calculate) rather than promised=2. Demand has fallen since Period 21 (recent 5-period mean \u224837 units) \u2014 use recent_N=5 to capture current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps orders aligned to the low recent demand while letting the backend adjust safety via its service-level formula; using recent data reduces overstock risk given large in-transit volume and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has fallen sharply (Periods 21-30 average low, last four demands 47,46,17,8) and on-hand=0 but large in-transit=529 units \u2014 pipeline vastly exceeds expected near-term demand. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (avg ~1.5) but no new sustained lead-time regime change. To avoid ordering into a heavy pipeline and incurring holding cost, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock and cap calculations (which will naturally limit new orders given the large in-transit inventory). No explicit reduction/increase to mu_hat or sigma_hat is warranted because recent low demand is already reflected in history and large pipeline dominates near-term availability.

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (demands mostly 90\u219247\u219243\u219237\u219232\u219247\u219246\u219217\u21928\u21928). On-hand=0, in-transit=534 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have varied; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer from conclude messages. For demand I use recent_N=11 (Periods 21\u201331) to capture the new low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; same recent window for volatility to reflect current lower variance. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the reduced demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Lead times have varied historically (avg \u22481.5 periods). To reflect realized lead-time variability use calculate (backend will avg observed lead times). To capture the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on last 5 periods) so the OR base-stock targets low current demand and avoids over-ordering given the large in-transit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been in the low regime that began at Period 21 (avg ~65.8 then falling to single-digit weekly sales in recent weeks: Periods 29-33 = 17,8,8,12,18). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2. I keep L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained low-demand regime from Period 21\u219233 (regime length 13) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 13 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices align ordering to the persistent low-demand regime while the backend caps orders using its cap; large in-transit inventory will prevent excessive new receipts.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand regime is the low regime starting Period 21 (avg ~65.8 through Period 25 then continued low demand through Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 \u2014 strong pipeline that will cover multiple periods even with L=2. Observed concluded lead times remain variable (historical average ~1.5) but no new sustained shift since prior carry-over. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures variability vs promised=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (use samples from the low-demand regime Periods 21\u201334) so mu_hat reflects the current low regime ((1+L) multiplier applied by backend). Sigma_hat set to recent_N N=14 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock while aligning forecast to the sustained low-demand regime, reducing holding risk.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the low regime identified at Period 21 (avg \u224865.8) \u2014 last 15 concluded periods (21\u201335) show consistently low weekly demand (mostly <50, many single-digit weeks). Lead time observations are variable (carry-over records avg \u22481.5) but no new sustained shift since last insight. To protect service in the current low-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability, I set L to be calculated from observed conclude messages (lets backend average observed lead times) and set demand estimates using the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N with N=15). Sigma is also recent_N with N=15 to capture low-regime volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the reduced demand and preserves safety stock for lead-time variability without overstocking (holding cost $1 vs profit $19).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21. Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (avg ~65.8) vs earlier higher regimes; last 16 periods (P21\u2013P36) define the current low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating mean demand estimate from older high-demand periods. Lead time observations are variable (observed lead_times include 1,2,3), so use calculated average lead time from all observed concludes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 to base (1+L) forecast and volatility on the current low-demand regime and reduce overstating demand; this balances service-level against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 with last 5 weeks (P33-37) averaging ~11.6 units/week. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 529 (large pipeline). Promised lead time = 2; historical conclues show variable LT but previous carry-over confirmed variability; however no new sustained LT shift since last insight, so use promised LT. Set L=default to keep OR backend using promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant recent data: 18,10,5,14,11 \u2192 mean \u224811.6; mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low-volatility samples. These settings keep replenishment small given large in-transit and low recent demand, reducing holding cost while meeting likely low demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 \u2014 large pipeline exists but many past shipments showed variable lead times and some long delays; recent concluded lead times average ~1.5 but variability persists. Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 21 (recent 5-period demands = [10,5,14,11,6], avg~9.2), so I forecast low near-term demand and tighten safety. I set L=calculate to let backend use the observed-average lead time history. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit stock. sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) reflects recent low-volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match current low demand while L=calculate accounts for observed lead-time variability and helps avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 \u2014 large pipeline present from prior orders. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (multiple 1\u20133 period observations); overall best to let backend compute average observed lead time. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 39); use a recent-N demand estimate covering that regime to avoid overstating forecast. Chosen: L by "calculate" to reflect observed lead-time average; mu_hat by "recent_N" with N=19 to use the last 19 periods (Periods 21\u201339) demand regime; sigma_hat by "recent_N" with N=19 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These settings keep target base stock aligned with the current low-demand regime while acknowledging realized lead-time behavior and avoiding additional over-ordering given large in-transit inventory.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=529 (many periods of pipeline). Lead time history shows variability; let backend compute observed average lead time from conclude messages.

Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times (avg ~1.5) and a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21. To reflect observed lead-time variability I let the backend calculate an empirical average lead time from concluded messages. For demand I use the most recent stable low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201340); per regime-length rules I select recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the last 20 samples. This balances service (use recent low-demand data, avoiding overstating demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21; I therefore forecast using the most recent regime data. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures variability noted in concludes). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps orders aligned with current low demand while accounting for lead-time uncertainty and avoiding excess holding given large in-transit stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). Observed lead times in history average ~1.5 periods (lead-time variability documented). I set L using calculate to let backend use observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current low-demand regime (use most recent 20 samples since the regime beginning at Period 21 is long and stable). Same recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices downweight older high-demand regimes while the large in-transit quantity means the OR engine will likely not order aggressively; choosing recent data avoids over-forecasting and excess holding cost.

Historical lead times are variable (avg ~1.5); use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. Set demand estimates from most recent 12 samples to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overordering given high pipeline and low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). Using recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat focuses the forecast on the current low regime and reduces safety stock from older high-demand periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent observed demand has been very low since Period 29 onward (many zero/low weeks through Period 45). Lead-time history shows variability (carry-over insight previously recorded). I use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times rather than relying on the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to focus the forecast on the low-demand regime from Period 29\u201345 (regime_length=17) so mu_hat reflects current low weekly demand across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=17 to capture volatility in this recent low-demand regime. This reduces overstock risk given large in-transit quantity (529 units) and low observed demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals not yet visible in conclude messages. Historical concluded lead-times show variability (avg ~1.5) so I let backend compute the average from observed concludes. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 46); I therefore forecast over the review+lead horizon using the most recent stable low-demand regime. Methods chosen: L='calculate' to reflect observed lead-time average from concluded messages; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 20 demand samples in the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=20 to capture recent demand volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with the prolonged low-demand regime while letting the OR engine use observed lead-time evidence.
