Promised lead time = 2 periods, so decision must cover current period demand (occurs after decision) plus the next 2 periods = L+1 = 3 periods of demand. Using a conservative blended forecast (~120 units/week) to balance service level vs. holding cost yields target coverage = 3 * 120 = 360 units. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19), so erring slightly high to avoid stockouts is justified. Therefore place an order of 360 units to cover the next three periods while we gather arrival/lead-time evidence.",
