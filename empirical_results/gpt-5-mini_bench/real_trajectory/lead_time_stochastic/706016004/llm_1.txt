Multiply by 3 periods => ~19.2 units. Add modest safety (\u224810%) to guard against the most recent spike and avoid lost sales given zero on-hand => target ~21 units.

  "rationale": "World + product: SKU is womens denim; period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas) \u2014 no seasonal spike expected now. Demand analysis: recent periods (P40\u2013P46) average \u224861 units/period, consistent with the downward regime confirmed previously (~57 units). Lead-time/pipeline: promised LT=2, historical arrivals have shown 1\u20132 periods; current in-transit=211 units. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 but in-transit 211 > (L+1)*forecast where L=2 and forecast\u224860 \u2192 coverage \u2248 211/60 \u22483.5 periods (covers next 3 periods). Risk: placing order increases holding cost $1/unit/period and inventory risk across a low-demand season. Decision: do not order this period to avoid excess holding cost; rely on in-transit stock to satisfy demand and await confirmed arrivals before placing new orders.",
