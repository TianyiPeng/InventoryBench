Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and only 5 weekly demand samples (mean=6.4). No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (use all available history) vs holding cost conservatively given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~6.4 units/week with moderate variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=16 (ordered in Period 1; promised lead time=2 so arrival is expected later). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use default lead time (promised L=2) to avoid premature adjustments. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level given the observed mean demand and avoids overreacting to a single delayed arrival while in-transit stock exists.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=66 (orders from P1+P2). No concluded arrivals yet beyond zeros, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Historical demand samples (5 weeks: 1,6,7,3,15) give mean=6.4. Using promised lead time (default L=2) yields review+lead horizon 1+L=3. Set mu_hat default so backend uses 3\xd7mean=19.2. Use sigma_hat default giving sqrt(3)\xd7sample std \u22489.30. These defaults keep the OR engine anchored to long-run sample stats while accounting for the 3-period coverage requirement; retaining promised lead time avoids overreacting to delayed but not-yet-confirmed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent actual demand (from concludes) = [57,72,64] over Periods 1-3; on-hand=0, in-transit=112 (sum of orders P1-P3). All three conclude messages show arrived=0, indicating shipments promised L=2 have not arrived. To guard against extended lead time / lost shipments, set lead time explicit=3. Forecast demand using the most recent regime (last 3 periods) so mu_hat recent_N N=3 and sigma_hat recent_N N=3. This raises the (1+L) coverage to respond to confirmed higher recent demand while accounting for delayed arrivals, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total 112 units) have not arrived by their promised windows (all conclude messages P1-P3 show arrived=0); treat actual lead time as 3 periods until contradicted.

Daily Profit: $200.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has jumped sharply vs. older samples (concluded demands P1-P4 = 57,72,64,92 vs. historical Jan samples 1,6,7,3,15) \u2014 treat this as a sustained new high-demand regime. Many earlier orders were delayed; recent conclude (Period 4) shows an order (from P2) arriving with lead_time=2 but P1 and P3 remained delayed, so conservatively set lead time longer. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed overdue shipments and reduce risk of stockouts. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 4 concluded demands). For sigma use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to serve the higher demand while accounting for the longer effective pipeline and help balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=236. History shows rising demand: P1-5 demands = [57,72,64,92,112]; a clear uptick starting Period 4. Several recent concludes show delayed/no arrivals (P1-P3 no arrivals; P5 conclude arrived=0 for latest order) so I conservatively treat lead time as longer than promised to protect service. Set L explicitly to 3 to cover potential extended transit. For demand I use the most recent 3 periods (Periods 3-5 demands = 64,92,112) to capture the new, higher regime (N=3 -> (1+L)*mean used by backend). Volatility is also based on the same recent 3 periods to reflect current variability. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while accounting for possible delayed arrivals; using recent samples avoids diluting the forecast with earlier lower-demand weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has increased sharply (periods 4-6: 92, 112, 184) and concluded lead-time observations are mixed (observed W=2 for order in P2->arrived P4, W=1 for order in P5->arrived P6; earlier orders P1-P3 initially showed arrived=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=268 (pipeline substantial). I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (average) so the backend captures the mixed evidence. For demand I bias to the recent upward regime using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the last three periods' higher demand; sigma_hat likewise uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices push the OR engine to raise the base stock for the elevated recent demand while letting the backend reconcile lead-time uncertainty from observed W values and the large existing pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=459. Recent concludes show highly variable/delayed arrivals (orders from P1-P3 did not arrive on-time; some later orders arrived with lead_times 1\u20132), suggesting actual lead time remains longer than promised and shipments are irregular. To protect service while accounting for extended transit, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing higher target inventory for the longer lead time against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has jumped vs early samples: last 4 period demands = [112,184,169,209] (mean=168.5). Current inventory (on-hand 111 + in-transit 139 = 250) is well below coverage needed for (1+L) periods at recent demand (with L estimated from recent observed lead times). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (periods where arrivals reported), so I use recent_N average to capture current mix. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 demand samples to respond to the recent higher-demand regime so the OR backend increases target base-stock and accounts for higher volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by using a recent-window estimate rather than the long-run low baseline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-15: recent demand regime is high (periods 4-9 demands = 92,112,184,169,209,140) vs earlier low historical samples. On-hand is 0 now; in-transit=376 with several delayed/late arrivals in history. Given sustained high weekly demand and observed shipment delays, I set lead time to 3 (explicit) and forecast demand using the most recent 6 periods to capture the current high-demand regime. sigma estimated from the same recent 6 samples to reflect current volatility. These choices increase safety stock to avoid stockouts amid delayed shipments while recognizing higher holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent observed lead times from concluded messages: {P2->P4:2, P5->P6:1, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1, P9->P10:1} -> mixed but average ~1.4. On-hand=127, in-transit=364 (sizable pipeline). I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect recent variability rather than blindly using the promised 2. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs. holding cost using the inferred lead time while preserving statistical pooling over history. This keeps orders conservative given large pipeline but incorporates shorter observed lead-times to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=33, in-transit=364. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P4),1 (P6),2 (P8),1 (P8),1 (P10) \u2014 mixed but average below the previously suspected 3-period delay. Demand history shows high variability but no sustained new demand regime since last insight. I select L='calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures recent mixed evidence rather than the original extreme 3-period assumption). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost with the inferred lead time and full sample history. This approach acknowledges recent on-time arrivals while still letting the OR engine account for past variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent realized weekly demand has jumped and stabilized at a higher level (Periods 4-12 demands = [92,112,184,169,209,140,110,94,97]); use a recent-sample forecast. Observed concluded lead times (from arrival messages) over recent arrivals = [2,1,2,1,1] \u2014 use a recent average of these. On-hand=0, in-transit=364 (pipeline large), so set parameters to reflect higher demand while letting OR cap limit orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded history shows variable observed lead times (1\u20132 periods) after some earlier delayed/no-arrival episodes; on-hand=0, in-transit=466. To let the OR engine infer a realistic lead time from observed concludes, I request the backend to calculate L as the average of observed lead times. For demand I use the backend defaults (all-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) so the engine's statistical baseline is applied; this is conservative given mixed recent demand and prior missing shipments. These settings balance service (backend computes base_stock using profit/(profit+holding)) while avoiding manual overreaction to a few delayed arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=466. Multiple past orders arrived late or not at promised LT; recent demand elevated (last 6 periods: 140,110,94,97,86,100 -> mean\u2248104.5) so I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover the observed extended LT. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover 4 periods of the recent higher demand and hedge against further delayed/lost shipments while balancing holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent demand has been elevated: last 6 concluded weekly demands = [110,94,97,86,100,137], mean=104. On-hand=0, in-transit=466 but recent concludes show orders not arriving within promised windows, consistent with extended lead time. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delays. Forecasting uses the most recent 6 weeks (N=6) to capture the current demand regime: mu_hat uses recent_N (1+L)\xd7mean over last 6 weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N over last 6 weeks to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to protect against stockouts given the longer effective lead time while keeping variance estimated from recent data to limit excess holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows repeated late/missing arrivals (orders in P1-P3 and P13\u672a onward not arriving on promised schedule). Treat actual lead time as 3 periods to be conservative. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed extended lead time. Demand has clearly shifted higher in recent weeks (last 5 demands: 97,86,100,137,151); I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime. This increases planned pipeline to cover longer lead time and higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures current volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has trended up (last five weekly demands: 86,100,137,151,163). On-hand=0, in-transit=505 \u2014 but several recent orders (notably P13=102 and P17=39, total 141 units) have not concluded by their promised windows, consistent with an extended lead time. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained multi-period delays (safer than promised L=2). To capture the recent upward demand regime I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the higher current demand (mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) while sigma_hat uses recent volatility. This increases the base-stock to avoid stockouts given longer lead times and rising demand while keeping variability estimated from recent observations to limit excessive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended to 3 periods (orders placed on Periods 13 and 17: 102 + 39 = 141 units have not arrived by their promised windows; consistent no-arrival signal across Periods 13\u201317).

Period 19 (2019-06-17): on-hand=0, in-transit=566, recent concluded history shows multiple promised arrivals missing across Periods 13\u201318, indicating extended lead time and outstanding pipeline. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed 3-period delays. Demand shows a clear recent regime (Periods 13\u201318) with mean ~125.7/week; I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals and limiting overstock by using recent data rather than long-run averages.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Recent conclude history shows repeated late/no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 13\u201317 and earlier (consistent with prior carry-over): evidence supports treating actual lead time as 3 periods for planning to avoid under-ordering. Demand has stepped up recently (Periods 15\u201319 demands = 137,151,163,117,115); I'll use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean/volatility. These parameters (L=recent explicit 3, mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 5) bias orders to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the OR backend will cap order size; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended to 3 periods (consistent no-arrival signal for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 and again for Periods 13\u201317; confirmed pattern spanning multiple periods).

Demand in Periods 13\u201320 has shifted to a higher recent regime (samples: 86,100,137,151,163,117,115,89); use recent_N=8 to reflect current demand level and volatility.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained extended lead time. Demand has risen recently (Periods 16\u201321: 151,163,117,115,89,78); I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime, which better balances stock for service (covering L+1 periods) vs holding costs given the long lead time and high in-transit exposure.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Recent concluded arrivals (Period 22: order from P20 arrived with lead_time=2; Period 19: P18 arrived with lead_time=1) show lead time behaving around the promised 2 periods rather than a sustained 3. Demand has clearly increased in recent months; last 10 observed weekly demands (Periods 13\u201322) average \u2248112.7 units/week, so I use a recent window to capture the new higher regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2) to let the OR engine assume promised behavior, and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base stock and cap on the elevated recent demand and its volatility. This balances service (avoid lost sales given large in-transit plus strong recent demand) against holding cost by letting OR compute safety stock from recent mean/variance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand (Periods 13\u201323) is elevated and relatively stable: [86,100,137,151,163,117,115,89,78,91,77] \u2014 recent regime length = 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=505 (large pipeline) but historical concludes show systematic multi-period delays; carry-over evidence indicates actual lead time = 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time so the OR engine plans for (1+L) review+lead coverage. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) so mu_hat reflects the mean of the last 11 observed demands scaled by (1+L). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=11) so volatility reflects recent variability over the same regime. This balances service (higher target stock due to longer lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been moderate but variable (Periods 20-24 demands = 89,78,91,77,38; mean \u2248 74.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=505 \u2014 substantial pipeline but past history shows shipments have been intermittently delayed/lost; multiple long stretches with no arrivals and prior carry-over notes indicate actual lead time has often behaved like 3 periods. To be conservative and ensure service, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent regime (last 5 observed demands) so mu_hat reflects current lower average demand while sigma_hat captures recent variability. This balances service-level (reduce stockouts under extended lead time) against holding cost given large existing in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Multiple concluded periods show repeated no-arrival signals beyond the promised 2-period lead time (notably extended gaps across P13\u2013P17 and earlier P1\u2013P3), so I treat actual lead time as 3 periods this decision. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P21\u2013P25 demands = 78,91,77,38,62) better represents current regime than older samples; I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 so the OR backend sizes the (1+L)-period demand forecast and uncertainty around current demand levels, balancing service vs. holding cost given the longer effective lead time and large in-transit exposure.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent observed demand has settled lower (~70 units/week) compared with earlier high-demand weeks; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=505 units and prior conclude messages indicate extended lead time. Multiple periods of no-arrival beyond promised windows support treating actual lead time as 3 periods to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect the persistent 3-period arrival pattern. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 22\u201326: 91,77,38,62,71) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and avoids inflating orders from older high-demand weeks. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to measure current volatility. This balances service (covering 4 periods of recent demand given longer lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and elevated holding cost risk.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20133, 13\u201317, and summary through Period 20) showed sustained delayed/no arrivals\u2014previous carry-over flagged lead time extended to 3 periods. Recent concludes show some individual earlier arrivals with shorter lags but no sustained contradiction of the multi-period no-arrival signal. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to protect against underestimating pipeline delay. With L=3 I use default demand estimates (all historical samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this yields conservative coverage across the review+lead horizon while letting the OR engine apply its capped order cap. This balances higher service level (avoid lost sales given long/uncertain lead times) versus holding cost by relying on the backend's profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Recent weeks show moderate demand (last 5 demands: 38,62,71,91,58 \u2192 mean\u224864). Multiple concluded periods previously indicate prolonged lead-time behavior; treating lead time as 3 periods improves coverage against the observed delayed arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time signals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest lower-summer demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. With L=3 and recent estimates the OR backend will target a base-stock covering (L+1) periods of the current lower mean while the large in-transit (505) will be reconciled by the engine to avoid over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Historical concludes show repeated delayed/no arrivals; evidence since Periods 13\u201320 and earlier indicates lead time has been effectively 3 periods. To avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals, set L explicit=3. For demand forecast, recent week-level demands (Periods 23\u201329: 77,38,62,71,91,58,48) reflect current regime; use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from these recent samples. This balances service (larger L increases required pipeline coverage) against holding cost by anchoring to recent demand rather than long-ago samples.

Historical conclude messages show a sustained pattern of delayed arrivals (no-arrival stretches across many periods), consistent with previously noted extended lead time of 3 periods. To protect service while avoiding excessive holding, set lead time explicit=3 so backend inflates the review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (captures full historical variance while scaling for L=3). This balances higher replenishment targets for delayed arrivals against holding cost.

To protect service given long observed lead times, set L explicit=3. Demand recently stabilized after earlier spikes; use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 10 demand samples, capturing the most recent regime while avoiding overweighting older volatile periods. This increases pipeline coverage for the longer lead time and balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) by using recent demand estimates rather than all-time averages.

Historical conclude messages show a persistent pattern of delayed arrivals consistent with an actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders across Periods 1-3 and 13-17 failed to arrive within promised windows). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier peaks; last 8 observed weekly demands (Periods 25-32) = [62,71,91,58,48,55,46,35], suggesting a lower recent mean. To protect service given suspected LT=3 while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, focusing the forecast on the most recent regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent observed demand (Periods 29-33 = 48,55,46,35,73; mean=51.4/week) shows moderate, stable demand. Multiple conclude messages across history indicate sustained extended lead time \u22483 (no-arrival patterns previously recorded). To protect service given promised L=2 but confirmed longer flows, I set L explicit=3. I set mu_hat explicit to (1+L)*recent mean = 4*51.4 = 205.6 to cover review+lead demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to let backend compute volatility from the latest 5 demand samples, keeping safety responsive to recent variance. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts under the confirmed longer lead time while limiting excess holding by using recent demand statistics.

Historical conclude messages show a sustained pattern of delayed/no arrivals consistent with an actual lead time of ~3 periods (multiple periods of no-arrival beyond promised L=2). To protect service given large pipeline and extended observed lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Demand has been lower and more stable in recent months vs earlier spikes; use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent regime (captures last two months of weekly demand). These settings bias the OR backend to target stock covering a 1+L window under the recent demand regime while accounting for observed longer lead time and avoiding excessive inventory holding given holding cost >0.

To protect service with current long pipeline and recent demand variability, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 28\u201335 demand: 58,48,55,46,35,73,75,67) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean over last 8 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders to cover the longer observed lead time while basing forecast/uncertainty on the most recent demand regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: orders from Periods 1\u20133, 13\u201317, and later did not arrive by promised windows; consistent no-arrival pattern across these spans).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent realized demand has settled lower (~35\u201375/week) vs earlier spikes; pipeline shows 505 units in-transit and on-hand=0. Historical conclude messages through Period 36 consistently indicate extended delivery delays; lead time has been observed as 3 periods across multiple spans (Periods 1\u20133,13\u201317, later) so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 8 demand observations, Periods 29\u201336) to capture the current lower-demand regime rather than the earlier high-demand spikes; this keeps base_stock aligned to current demand and reduces excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. With L=3 the OR backend will compute (1+L)-period demand and safety stock from these recent stats, balancing service level vs holding cost while the 505 in-transit is expected to cover several upcoming periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand (Periods 29\u201337): [48,55,46,35,73,75,67,60,62] \u2014 stable mid-range with occasional spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=505 (pipeline large). Historical conclude messages (up through Period 36) consistently indicate actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from multiple windows failed to arrive by promised 2); treat lead time as 3 until contradicted. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time so the OR engine sizes pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods correctly. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to focus the forecast on the last 9 observed weekly demands (captures current regime and recent variability) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reduces influence of much older samples and aligns base-stock with recent demand while the large in-transit quantity limits immediate additional ordering risk.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent observed demand has been ~60\u201370/week (Periods 32\u201338 = 35,73,75,67,60,62,59 with recent median \u224862). On-hand=0, in-transit=505 (large pipeline but past history shows extended actual lead time = 3 periods). Many past orders arrived with 1\u20132 period delays, but multiple sustained no-arrival windows confirm actual lead time \u22483; treat shipments as arriving later than promised. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time. To forecast demand across review+lead, I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent regime (weekly demand ~60s) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under current demand and variability while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history shows repeated no-arrival patterns earlier and lead time confirmed as 3 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=505 (large pipeline). Given confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly=3 so OR backend forecasts over correct review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (stable historical sample base). This balances service (longer coverage for 4-period demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20133,13\u201317, multiple later spans) consistently show arrivals delayed beyond promised 2 periods; lead time sustained at 3 periods \u2014 use explicit L=3. Demand has been lower and stable in recent months (Periods 29\u201340: series of weekly demands mostly in the 35\u201375 range) indicating a new lower-demand regime; use recent data to avoid bias from early large spikes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (captures the most recent ~3 months of weekly demand). With L=3, (1+L)=4 will be applied by backend; using recent_N=12 focuses the forecast and volatility on the recent lower regime, reducing excess inventory while covering four-period demand under the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Historical conclude messages through Period 36 consistently show orders arriving later than the promised 2 periods (multiple groups of orders across Periods 1\u20133, 13\u201317, etc. arrived with 3-period lag), so actual lead time is best treated as 3. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=505 (large pipeline but arrivals are delayed). To ensure the OR engine plans for the longer delivery horizon and leverages its built-in aggregation of historical demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this lets the engine apply its capped ordering logic while accounting for the extended lead time and balancing profit vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=505. Historical conclude messages consistently show delayed/no arrivals beyond the promised 2 periods across many spans (Periods 1\u20133, 13\u201317, 36) \u2014 lead time confirmed as 3 periods. To ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicitly=3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (covering extra lead time) against holding cost given limited on-hand but large in-transit. This choice avoids trusting possibly missing short-term samples while ensuring orders cover the longer confirmed lead time.

History shows repeated multi-period no-arrivals and prior carry-over conclusions (Periods 4,18,20,36) confirming actual lead time is sustained at 3 periods. To protect service while in-transit stock is confirmed but arrival timing is delayed, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all historical demand to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances higher target safety stock from longer L against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=505 \u2014 substantial pipeline but long lead. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delivery delays. Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent 20 weekly demand observations (captures current regime including the large spike at Period 42) and produce (1+L)\xd7recent mean, balancing responsiveness to recent pattern vs older data. Volatility: use default so sigma scales with sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting OR backend account for overall historical variability while my L and recent mean focus service-level alignment under extended lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Historical conclude messages show a sustained pattern of delayed/no arrivals consistent with actual lead time = 3 (confirmed across multiple spans through Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=505 \u2014 which comfortably covers several weeks of demand if lead time is 3. To reflect the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3. Recent weekly demand has averaged ~67 units (Periods 41\u201345), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current regime and recent seasonality. These parameters (L=3, recent-N demand estimates) make the OR backend compute a base-stock that protects against the longer confirmed lead time while recent_N volatility keeps safety stock responsive to current variability; with in-transit=505 I expect little immediate ordering pressure but maintain safety via the recent-based forecast.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=505 \u2014 large pipeline but historical conclude messages indicate shipments have been delayed repeatedly; treat lead time as 3 periods. Recent on-board demand (Periods 39\u201346) shows modest weekly demand with one spike at Period 42; to be responsive to recent pattern and holiday volatility I use recent_N=8 (last 8 demand periods) to estimate demand across the review+lead window (with L=3). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the OR backend target supply to the current regime while shrinking influence of older pre-holiday data. This helps balance service (avoid stockouts given long lead times) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand and the confirmed longer lead time.
