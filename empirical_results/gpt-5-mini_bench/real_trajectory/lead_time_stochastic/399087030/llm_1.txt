Ladies denim (fashion bottoms) can see a small seasonal uplift around mid-Feb promotions, but no major holiday-driven surge like late-Nov/Dec. b) Demand analysis: historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable weekly demand ~102\u2013123; mean \u2248 111\u2013115 units/period. c) Lead-time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 2 periods. No concluded arrivals yet to contradict this; in-transit=0 and on-hand=0, so treat L=2 for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, we must plan to cover current period plus the next L periods (L+1 = 3 periods) because arrivals placed now will not arrive until Period 3. Forecasting 115 units/period \xd7 3 periods = 345 units to meet expected demand; given modest upside risk around Valentine\u2019s and low holding cost relative to profit, add small buffer. e) Final order: Place 360 units now to cover ~3.1 periods of expected demand (345 baseline + 15-unit buffer). This balances service level (avoid stockouts at arrival) against holding cost given high unit profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1/period).",

Promised lead time = 2, but concluded arrivals show mixed actual LT (observed LTs = 1 and 2); no sustained LT change confirmed. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 660 units which exceeds reasonable coverage: using conservative demand forecast 60/week and LT+1 coverage = 3 weeks \u2192 required \u2248180 units. Pipeline (660) >> needed coverage, so ordering risks heavy holding cost ($1/unit/period). Therefore place no new order this period.",
