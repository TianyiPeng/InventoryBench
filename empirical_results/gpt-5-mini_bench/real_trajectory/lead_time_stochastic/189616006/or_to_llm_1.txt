Policy check vs. OR: OR recommends 168 based on promised L=2 and its base-stock calc; however, the decision rule requires that order + on-hand + in-transit cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because current-period demand occurs after ordering. Required coverage \u2248 3 \xd7 55 = 165 units. With in-transit=248 (>165) we already have sufficient pipeline to meet the next (L+1) periods even allowing for lead-time variability. Cost tradeoff: profit=$19 vs holding=$1 favors stocking, but excess inventory still incurs holding cost each period; placing OR's 168 would create substantial excess (416 total pipeline+order) and unnecessary holding cost.

  "rationale": "Period context: today is 2019-12-23 (Period 46) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=290. OR recommends 131 using promised L=2 and historical demand; OR cannot detect lost/overdue shipments or the strong recent spike. Lead-time inference: multiple recent conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders that should have arrived by now (no concluded arrivals in Periods 42\u201345), so the current in-transit 290 is suspect/overdue and may not be reliable. Demand outlook: the last four weeks show a sharp spike (Periods 42\u201345 demands = 129, 46, 45, 356) with a very large week at Period 45 (356) consistent with pre-Christmas surge (calendar-driven). Because review+lead horizon = L+1 = 3 periods, target coverage should be ~3\xd7 current high weekly demand. Using a short-run demand estimate anchored to recent weeks (mean \u2248144 over P42\u201345, but conservatively using the large observed spike), I target ~432 units to cover ~3 high-demand weeks. Pipeline/in-transit not trusted due to overdue arrivals and lack of concluded arrivals; therefore I do not deduct the 290 from the target. I place an order of 432 units to build availability through the holiday window. Risk trade-offs: holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so erring on the side of availability for the immediate 3-week horizon is preferred to avoid large lost-sales during the season. I do not record a new carry-over insight because the holiday spike is not yet a sustained multi-period regime change (only one extreme week), and the overdue in-transit status is a shipment anomaly but not confirmed lost with 3+ periods of consistent evidence per the carry-over rules.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 722. Promised lead time = 2, but recent arrivals have variable actual lead times and some shipments delayed; however 722 units in-pipeline already provide ample coverage. Recent weekly demands show extreme volatility (e.g., Periods 45\u201346: 356 and 180) but this looks like a short holiday spike, not a sustained regime shift (needs 3+ periods to record). Required coverage = (L+1)=3 periods; even using a high short-term demand estimate of ~180/week, 722 covers ~4 weeks. Ordering now risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) and possible exacerbation if shipments later conclude or are duplicated. Therefore follow OR recommendation and place 0 units this period. I will monitor concluded arrivals in coming periods to detect lost shipments or a sustained demand change and adjust future orders accordingly.",
