Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks through 2019-02-04) show no clear changepoint or seasonality. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overcommitting given zero pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent sample mean demand = 42.4 units/week (samples: 36,56,33,45,42). On-hand=0, in-transit=58 (order from P1). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; the outstanding 58 units partially covers upcoming demand. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L=default to keep backend assumption at promised 2 periods; use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level against low holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=142; two recent orders (P1:58, P2:84) have not concluded yet so actual lead time is still unconfirmed. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~42.4 units. I choose L='default' (use promised 2 periods) because concluded messages do not yet prove a systematic lead-time change or lost shipments. I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost conservatively while awaiting confirmed lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods (P1-P3) show no arrivals despite orders placed (P1:58, P2:84, P3:109) and on-hand=0, in-transit=251 \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Historical weekly mean demand = 42.4 (samples: 36,56,33,45,42). I set L explicit=3 to account for observed shipment delays beyond promised 2. I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this increases target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead+review horizon while letting OR backend apply its service-level cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely > promised 2: orders placed P1 (58), P2 (84), P3 (109) have not concluded by P4; in-transit=251 \u2014 possible sustained shipment delay or losses.

Daily Profit: $1577.00, Daily Holding Cost: $1.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1576.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent concluded data: Period4 shows arrival of Period2 order with observed lead_time=2; orders from Period1 and Period3 remain unconcluded and in-transit. On-hand=1, in-transit=300. Promised lead time=2 and observed arrival supports that for the concluded sample, so use calculated lead time to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (weekly samples mean=42.4) is limited and shows no sustained regime change, so use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to keep forecasts stable. These settings are conservative given possible lost/delayed shipments: they let the OR engine compute base_stock using observed lead-time behavior while avoiding aggressive explicit increases that could raise holding cost if some in-transit is lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent demand samples average 42.4/wk (samples: 36,56,33,45,42). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 \u2014 multiple past orders delayed (P1,P3) though P2 showed lead_time=2 when it arrived in P4. Because only one concluded lead-time exists, I will not override promised lead time and will use default calculations: L=promised (2), mu_hat and sigma_hat = default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend aligned with contractual lead_time while acknowledging outstanding in-transit inventory and delayed arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Concluded lead times observed: Period4 arrival shows order from P2 had lead_time=2; Period6 arrival shows order from P5 had lead_time=1 \u2192 recent observed lead times = [2,1]. Recent demand (Periods 4-6) = [83,69,57], suggesting current regime average \u224869.7. I choose L recent_N (N=2) to reflect short recent lead-time evidence, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast demand over review+lead using the most recent stable demand window (Periods 4-6). These settings bias ordering toward recent realized demand while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and cap, mitigating risk from delayed/lost older orders while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (P2\u2192arrived in P4: LT=2; P5\u2192arrived in P6: LT=1) and earlier missing arrivals (P1,P3) indicating instability but not a sustained single new LT. On-hand=0, in-transit=300 \u2014 pipeline is large but partially uncertain. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 2 and 1 period observations). For demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio and avoids overfitting to noisy recent fluctuations or possibly lost orders.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-8 = 83,69,57,55,104) is substantially higher than the old 2019 samples; shipments show variable lead times (observed arrivals: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1) and earlier orders may have been lost/delayed. To capture the recent higher demand I use recent_N for demand estimates (last 5 concluded demands). For lead time I use recent_N over the two observed lead-time samples to reflect variability (avg ~1.5). Sigma uses the recent 5-period window to capture current volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated recent demand while acknowledging lead-time uncertainty so the backend's capped order will limit extreme stocking given holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has sharply increased (last samples: 55,104,187) vs earlier weeks; on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Observed concluded lead times: one arrival showed 2 periods (order P2\u2192arrived P4) and one showed 1 period (P5\u2192P6); average observed lead time ~1.5. No sustained multi-period increase in lead time (mixed 1 and 2), so use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile promised vs observed. Use default demand/statistics aggregation otherwise so backend applies full historical sample set ((1+L)*mean) and std scaling; this balances service level given high recent demand while avoiding overfitting to the last extreme spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 period demands: 57,55,104,187,98; mean ~100). On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (many earlier orders still undelivered or delayed). Observed concluded lead times: arrival in P4 for order from P2 => 2 periods; arrival in P6 for order from P5 => 1 period; average observed lead time ~1.5, so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (last 5 periods) so base stock reflects current demand surge while respecting pipeline; this balances service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent realized demand has jumped (Periods 7-11: 55,104,187,98,156) vs earlier baseline (~36\u201356). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 but many past orders (P1,P3,P10,P11) remain unconcluded \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative vs. shipment uncertainty I set lead time explicitly to 3 (longer than promised 2) so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. For demand I detect a sustained upward regime over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 7\u201311), so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher mean and volatility in the (1+L) review+lead window. This increases target base-stock to improve service under the new demand regime while acknowledging higher holding cost via the capped order policy.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=651 (large pipeline). Recent demand has trended up (periods 8-12 demands: 104,187,98,156,148) \u2014 higher-volatility, higher-mean regime versus the Jan samples. Observed concluded lead times recently: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 variable but recent average ~1.5. I set L to recent_N (N=2) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time samples. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent demand regime (uses last 5 demand periods to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma similarly uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the backend raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid under/over-ordering given the large in-transit volume and past shipment variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=558 with several earlier orders delayed; concluded arrivals show lead times of 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), and 2 (P11->P13) \u2014 recent observed lead times = [2,1,2], average ~1.67. Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9-13) = [187,98,156,148,94], mean = 136.6 units. I choose L as recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time samples while being responsive to variability. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (backend will apply (1+L)*mean). I leave sigma_hat as default (uses all samples) since volatility evidence is mixed. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to recent higher demand and slightly elevated lead-time estimate while avoiding over-committing inventory given possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (orders on P2\u2192arrive P4, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14) with one 1-period (P5\u2192P6). On-hand=60, in-transit=361 (total pipeline 421) \u2014 ample pipeline but historical shipments showed delays/losses early; using observed lead-time average lets OR backend adapt to actual behavior. I select L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to provide a stable baseline forecast given limited sample set. This balances service (using calculated L) against holding cost by not inflating demand estimates beyond historical average.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2\u2192P4, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent conclude messages (P2\u2192P4, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14) confirm actual lead time = 2 periods. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=361 \u2014 pipeline large relative to historical weekly mean (~42.4). Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand (mean\u224842.4) while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding overreaction to recent arrival/loss noise. This balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high q) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has risen and become more volatile since Period 9 (demands: 104,187,98,156,148,94,137,147,199) vs earlier Jan sample mean ~42. On-hand=0, in-transit=413 (covers multiple outstanding orders); past concludes (P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14, P2\u2192P4) confirm actual lead time = 2, so use promised lead time. I detect a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 9; I use recent_N=8 (Periods 9\u201316) to capture the new mean for the (1+L)-period forecast. Using recent data increases service level to avoid lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility so OR backend caps orders appropriately given holding cost vs profit tradeoff. No new evidence of further lead-time drift or lost shipments since lead time was reconfirmed at Period 15.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime since ~Period 8 (weekly demands ~100\u2013200 vs earlier ~30\u201360). Lead times observed recently are mixed (recent concluded lead_times: 2,2,1), so I average the last few observed lead times to capture variability. I set L via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent lead-time mix. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the last 10 weeks' mean across review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to improve service during this higher-demand regime while using recent lead-time averaging to avoid overstocking if lead-time shortened.

I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 outcomes). Demand history is limited but stable seasonally; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) lets the OR engine apply the full-sample forecast while accommodating the inferred average lead time. This balances service (higher L implies larger (1+L) coverage) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and profit/holding ratio.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24. Recent history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime since Period 7 (period 7-19 mean \u2248138 units vs historical mean 42.4). Observed concluded lead times (chronological): 2,1,2,2,1,1 \u2014 mixed but shorter recently. I set L using recent_N on the last 6 observed lead-time samples to capture current blend (avg \u22481.5). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 7-19) to capture the new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts; this accepts higher holding cost but protects profitable sales (profit $19 >> holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Periods 7-19): mean demand increased from 42.4 to 138.2 (+226%), sustained over 13 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has shifted up (Periods 7-19 average ~138; last 5 periods even higher ~177). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 (large pipeline of outstanding orders). Use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times (historical concludes show mixed 1\u20132 periods). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 7\u201319, regime_length=13). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility. Large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency; these parameters focus orders on meeting the elevated demand while letting the OR cap limit excessive new receipts given holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=567. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed W = 2,1,2,2,1,1); demand experienced a sustained regime shift (Periods 7\u201319) to higher mean (~138). To capture the confirmed higher demand I use recent_N for demand parameters (N=13, the sustained high-demand regime length). For lead time I let the backend compute the empirical average from observed lead times (calculate) to reflect the 1\u20132 variability. These choices bias orders upward to meet the new higher demand while relying on the backend's averaged L; using recent_N for mu/sigma limits dilution from earlier low-demand periods and balances service level vs. holding cost given high in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15): on-hand=0, in-transit=526. Historical concludes show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods with confirmed 2-period events; promised lead time=2. Demand has shifted up substantially since Period 7 (carry-over insight: mean \u2248138 over P7\u2013P19) and recent weeks remain elevated (recent demands: P16\u2013P22 = 199,143,128,201,216,158,108; recent mean \u2248165). To cover the review+lead horizon while reflecting the sustained higher demand, keep L as default (promised=2), set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the elevated recent mean (N=7), and set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same window (N=7) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=578 \u2014 large pipeline but many past delays; concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (mix). I use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history (captures 1\u20132 period reality rather than promised=2). Demand clearly shifted up vs early history; recent demand (Periods 17\u201323 = 143,128,201,216,158,108,99) has mean ~150. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the most recent regime and avoid diluting with low pre-shift samples. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so sigma_hat recent_N N=7. These choices keep base stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while using observed lead times to avoid over/under-ordering given past shipment variability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime (Periods 20-24: 216,158,108,99,102 \u2014 recent mean ~136.6/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=579 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with lead time confirmed as 2 in prior analysis; promised lead time=2 is still appropriate. To capture the recent high-demand regime while keeping safety for the 2-period lead, I set L to default (promised=2), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 5 weeks, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus orders on the currently sustained higher demand while the large in-transit quantity limits excessive new ordering and holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=579 (large pipeline covering many future periods). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132) with prior confirmation of 2-periods; pipeline shows past delays but many orders have concluded recently. Demand has undergone a sustained upward regime (mean ~138 units/week across recent periods). To respect promised lead-time while reflecting the new higher-demand regime, I keep L=default (use promised 2) and use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the elevated mean/volatility from recent weeks (N=19 covers the sustained high-demand window). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the new regime while relying on the declared lead time the backend expects; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Demand experienced a sustained upshift earlier (Periods 7\u201319 avg ~138) and recent weekly demand remains elevated vs original 42.4 baseline. On-hand=21, in-transit=493 (large pipeline). Lead times have varied recently (observed: 1,2,3) \u2014 use a short recent average to adapt. Chosen methods: L recent_N N=5 to reflect latest variability (captures the recent 3,2,1,2,1 observations); mu_hat recent_N N=13 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime duration (Periods 7\u201319) so the OR base-stock uses the higher forecast; sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect increased volatility during that regime. These settings push the backend to target a higher base-stock (serving elevated demand) while using recent lead-time averaging to avoid overcommitting if lead times shorten.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows variable but elevated demand since Period 7 with a sustained regime shift (carry-over records mean ~138). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3], avg=1.7 -> use calculated estimate for L to let backend use empirical avg. For demand I use recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods ~15\u201327 window) so mu_hat reflects the new mean across the review+lead window. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=13) to reflect recent volatility under the new regime. This set tells the OR engine to target service under the confirmed higher-demand regime while accounting for the observed shorter-than-promised average lead time and recent variability; it balances profit vs holding by using recent demand evidence rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=541 (large pipeline with mixed/late arrivals historically). Concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (1,2 and one 3); average observed lead time is best used rather than blindly trusting promised. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 7 (noted in carry-overs). I set L to calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full demand history, letting it incorporate the documented regime shift and observed variability while respecting the capped ordering policy. This balances service (using observed lead-time avg) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and uncertain arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=541 \u2014 large pipeline with history of variable and sometimes extended lead times (observed lead times: 1,2,3 across concluded messages) and many delayed/lost arrivals earlier. Demand has undergone a sustained regime shift (Periods 7\u201319) with much higher mean; recent periods continue to show elevated demand. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures variable/extended LT seen in concludes). For demand I use recent_N (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the new high-demand regime (13-period sustained shift) so the base-stock reflects higher mean and volatility and avoids chronic stockouts despite shipping variability. This balances higher service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=493 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead times show variability with more 2\u20133 period observations (last observed lead times: 2,2,1,3,3 \u2192 avg\u22482.2). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift earlier (Periods 7\u201319) to higher demand; recent history remains at elevated level. To balance service and holding cost: set lead time using recent average (captures drift to longer delays), set demand forecast using recent regime samples (captures elevated mean), and compute volatility from same recent window for consistent safety stock scaling. This keeps orders responsive to the higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory given large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=493 \u2014 large pipeline but many past periods showed delayed arrivals (some 2\u20133 periods). Recent concluded arrivals (Periods 26 and 30) show lead_time=3, so I conservatively set L=3 to let the OR engine plan for longer delivery. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 7; recent 13-week mean (Periods 19\u201331) ~115.5/week. I set mu_hat using recent_N=13 to capture the post-shift demand (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean over last 13 samples). I set sigma_hat recent_N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts) while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) but lead time was previously confirmed as 2 in Period 15; pipeline is large and uncertain so keep promised lead time. Demand shifted up around Period 20 (sustained higher regime). I set L=default to use the promised 2-period lead time (OR engine expects promised L). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the post-shift high-demand regime (periods showing mean \u2248138.2 sustained ~13 periods).

Historical concluded lead times show variability (samples: 2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,2) so average lead time \u22481.83; I choose to let backend calculate average from concluded samples. Demand experienced a sustained high regime since Period 7 (carry-over insight) so I bias demand estimates toward recent high-demand periods \u2014 use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. These settings (avg lead time; demand and volatility from recent 20 periods) help the OR engine size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while reflecting recent variance; large in-transit reduces immediate order needs but variability in lead times argues for using recent demand/windowed estimates rather than long-run averages.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=616; historical concluded lead times recently show several 3-period arrivals (P26,P30) plus 2s and 1s, so actual lead time often > promised 2. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime around Periods 7\u201319 (carry-over) and subsequent weeks remain elevated vs earliest samples. To be conservative against delayed arrivals and to cover the post-shift demand regime, I set L using a recent average of the last 5 observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 demand periods to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime; this increases safety stock to balance lost-sales cost (profit $19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period actual lead times (multiple orders P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35). On-hand=25, in-transit=493 (large pipeline). I set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times to capture the recent shift to 3. For demand I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the latest observed demand regime (~70\u2013110 range) and avoid contaminating the forecast with much older data. These choices raise the review+lead demand estimate to cover (1+L) periods while keeping volatility driven by recent variability; given high pipeline, this will prevent over-ordering while maintaining service under the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): on-hand=0, in-transit=493. Recent concluded arrivals (P26, P30, P35) show lead times = 3,3,3 with a 2 in between \u2192 recent evidence supports actual lead time ~3. Demand in the most recent 6 concluded periods (P31\u2013P36 = 89,70,110,83,98,61) averages \u224885.2; demand appears lower than the earlier high-regime spike so I use a recent-window demand estimate. To cover the review+lead window and reflect recent variability, I set L using the last 3 observed lead times (captures the recent 3-period pattern), mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 demand samples (balances responsiveness vs. noise). These parameters increase service for the 4-period coverage (1+L) while avoiding carrying excessive inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=493. Concluded arrivals show recent lead times = 3 in the last three confirmed deliveries (orders on P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35), so I estimate lead time from the most recent observations. Demand regime shifted up at Period 20 and has remained elevated through Period 37; use the recent regime sample to forecast demand and volatility. Therefore: L set by recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent confirmed LT=3; mu_hat and sigma_hat set by recent_N using the post-shift regime length (N=18) to reflect the sustained higher demand and its variability. These choices align pipeline coverage (longer LT) and raise the base stock to protect service while the sigma estimate increases safety stock but the capped order cap prevents extreme orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=493. History shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with several recent 3-period observations and an earlier confirmed LT=3 at P36; overall observed average LT \u22481.92. Demand experienced a sustained higher regime starting Period 7\u201319 (regime length 13). To capture the empirically observed lead-time central tendency while allowing the OR engine to compute using observed data, I set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (matching the detected 13-period regime) so mu_hat reflects the post-changepoint demand level across the review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching the backend forecast window to the sustained demand regime and recent lead-time evidence so the base-stock policy and cap are computed from appropriate recent statistics while relying on the backend to apply the promised-lead-time mechanics.

To avoid under-ordering given confirmed longer lead time, set L based on the last 3 observed lead times (average=3). Use default demand and volatility estimation so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overfitting to short recent fluctuations while letting the backend increase order-up-to for the longer lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 31\u201340) is lower than the earlier high-regime, so use a short recent window for demand estimates. Set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed recent lead-time regime of 3. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the most recent 10 demand observations (Periods 31\u201340) and reduce influence of the earlier high-demand regime. These choices align the OR backend's base-stock target to the latest supply-delay pattern while basing demand forecasts on the recent lower-demand pattern, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Recent demand (Periods 37-41) averaged ~57.4 units/week, lower than the earlier high regime. To reflect observed lead-time =3 and recent demand level, I set L explicit=3 so the OR backend treats review+lead horizon correctly. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest demand regime (Periods 37-41) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to estimate current volatility. These choices reduce stockouts from longer observed lead times while avoiding excess inventory from older high-demand periods.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time. Demand in the last 6 concluded periods (P37\u2013P42) is variable with a large spike at P42, so I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the most recent regime and volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding overcommitment given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Recent realized demand (most recent 7 concluded periods P37\u2013P43: 80,75,64,30,38,150,46) better reflects current demand regime than older high-demand months; I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat over the review+lead horizon (1+L=4) to capture current demand level and volatility and reduce overshooting given large in-transit. This balances service (covering upcoming 4 periods) against holding cost by sizing forecasts to recent lower/variable demand rather than long-run high-demand spikes.

Historical conclude messages show variable lead times with confirmed 3-period observations (Period 36) and past regime shift to higher demand around Period 20. No new multi-period signals since last carry-over. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history to estimate current effective lead time (captures mixed 1\u20133 period observations). For demand I focus on the most recent N=5 periods to capture the late-Nov/Dec demand pattern (avoids diluting recent holiday spike with older low-demand periods): mu_hat -> recent_N N=5. Volatility likely changed recently as well, so sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices balance service (using recent demand & observed lead times) against holding cost during a potentially elevated holiday demand period.

I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 20 demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.
