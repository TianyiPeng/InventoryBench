Recent weeks center ~40\u201347; I'll use a conservative forecast ~45 units/week to balance trend and possible Valentine uplift. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 2 periods. No in-transit or concluded arrivals to infer a shorter/longer lead time. Assume supplier lead time = 2 for ordering coverage. d) Inventory: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With lead time=2 we must cover current period plus 2 future periods (L+1=3) when ordering. e) Order logic: Order to cover 3 periods \xd7 forecast 45 = 135 units.

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-16 (mid-December) noted but no immediate SKU-specific seasonal spike for a basic women's T-shirt; December could see higher apparel traffic but recent history shows very low weekly demand. Recent demands (P40\u2013P44): 28,47,64,17,17 \u2192 5-period avg \u224835/wk. Promised lead time = 2 and prior carry-over confirms many orders have been arriving with 2-period lead (several P\u2192P+2 arrivals), though earlier periods had missing shipments; current in-transit = 410 units (large pipeline). On-hand = 0. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~35/wk requires \u2248105 units. Given large in-transit (410) and confirmed 2-period lead-time for many recent orders, placing additional order risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit is $4/unit. Also current observed demand shows no sustained holiday spike (only 5 low periods). Therefore do not order now and let the in-transit inventory arrive and satisfy demand.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas). Nora T-shirt is an everyday basic; holiday gift effect might give a small uplift but historically this SKU shows no December spike in the provided history (Periods 33\u201345 demand low: recent weeks 61,28,47,64,17,17,21). Demand regime: recent sustained lower regime since Period 33 (mean \u224870 earlier then falling to very low levels in Dec); no evidence of a new sustained increase. Lead time / pipeline: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 2 periods. Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 410 units \u2014 this is ample to meet expected near-term demand even if a modest holiday uptick occurs (410 units covers multiple weeks at current low demand). Risk: Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4; ordering now would incur holding cost for inventory that will arrive after 2 periods and likely sit through low-demand weeks; also prior history shows delayed/lost shipments earlier so avoid adding more pipeline. Final order logic: Do not place any new order this period to avoid extra holding cost and pipeline risk; use in-transit inventory when it arrives.",

{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30\u2014post-Christmas week; apparel demand is typically low after holiday promotions. b) Demand regime: Recent periods 40\u201346 show sustained low weekly demand (28,47,64,17,17,21,15) consistent with previously recorded lower regime starting P33. c) Lead time / missing orders: Historical concluded arrivals confirm frequent delays and missing shipments; lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods for several orders, but many earlier orders remain overdue and large in-transit balances (risk of non-arrival). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=410 units \u2014 this is large relative to current low demand (~<40/week). Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit \u2014 excess inventory will incur holding penalties. e) Order decision: Do not place additional orders this period to avoid increasing holding cost and exacerbating potential overstock given large in-transit quantity and current low demand.",
