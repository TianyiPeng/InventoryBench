Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks): [270,196,180,187,137]; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so pipeline empty. No sustained changepoint or delayed shipments observed (only 5 recent samples, modest downward drift but not 3+ periods). Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so OR backend computes base stock to cover (1+L) periods given available history and cost tradeoff (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent observed demand samples (weekly): 270,196,180,187,137 \u2192 mean=194 units/week, std\u224843.06. On-hand=0, in-transit=274 (order from P1 not yet arrived in P1 conclude). One missed arrival is not yet sufficient evidence of a lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid premature adjustments. With L=2, default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3*194 \u2248 582 to cover review+lead demand; default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(3)*43.06 \u2248 74.6 to reflect variability across the review+lead window. These settings balance service level (coverage for 3 periods of average demand) versus holding cost, while remaining conservative about the single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 194 units/week. Two recent orders (Periods 1 and 2) remain unarrived in concluded messages\u2014possible delays but not yet 3+ periods of missing arrivals, so no confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time to avoid overreacting to potentially lost shipments. Set L to default (promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures current historical mean 194 and volatility across the 5 samples). This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting OR backend compute the critical fractile and capped order, while conservatively not inflating demand or lead-time estimates on limited delay evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3): 84, 121, 108; historical sample mean = 194 (5 samples from Jan-Feb). On-hand=0, in-transit=676 (matches cumulative orders placed in P1-P3). One expected arrival (P1 orders) failed to show up by its conclude, but this is a single missed arrival\u2014insufficient to confirm a lead-time shift. To avoid overreacting to potentially lost/delayed shipments, use promised lead time and population statistics. I choose default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend will compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples; this balances service-level from historical mean against holding cost while preserving caution given unsettled in-transit status.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2441.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=143, in-transit=397. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 4 reported arrival of the Period 2 order (lead_time=2). Orders from Periods 1 and 3 have not concluded and may be lost/delayed; however we have one confirmed lead-time sample matching the promised 2-period lead time. I choose L by calculate to let backend average observed lead times (evidence=Period2\u2192Period4). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples\u2014this balances service level (captures uncertainty over review+lead window) against holding cost given relatively high profit/low holding cost ratio. Using defaults avoids overreacting to possibly lost shipments until more lead-time evidence accumulates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). On-hand=1, in-transit=492 => pipeline already large vs historical weekly mean (~194). Profit/holding ratio implies high service target, but given large pipeline I keep default demand estimates and promised lead time to let OR engine cap orders. Set L=default (use promised L=2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This avoids overreacting to recent arrivals and leverages confirmed lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded history shows mixed arrival timing but prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=525 (pipeline large versus weekly historical mean ~194). I use default lead time (promised 2) because concluded evidence is limited and the OR engine expects promised L. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (covering multi-period demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and some delayed arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized weekly demand has fallen vs. the historical Jan samples: concluded demands for Periods 4-7 = [136,142,128,145] (avg \u2248140). On-hand=0, in-transit=608 which already covers roughly 4+ weeks at the recent pace and comfortably exceeds (1+L) periods demand under promised L=2. Lead-time observations are mixed (observed 2 and 1) so I keep the promised/default lead time. To reflect the clear recent lower-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent 4 concluded weeks (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the recent mean/volatility rather than the earlier higher-Jan samples. This avoids overstock while pipeline inventory suffices to meet near-term demand and balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-8) averaged ~140 units/week (136,142,128,145,148) which is lower than the older 5-sample historical mean (~194). Pipeline is large: on-hand=63, in-transit=397 (total pipeline=460) so near-term coverage is ample. Observed lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); using the average of all observed lead times (calculate) captures this mix. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate (Periods 4-8) to adapt to the lower recent regime, scaling by (1+L) in backend. For volatility I use recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand dispersion. These choices reduce unnecessary ordering given large pipeline while preserving service given recent lower demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-9) averages ~121 units/week with moderate variability; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5) so I let the backend compute an updated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 \u2014 pipeline is large (\u22483.3 weeks of demand) and already covers more than (1+L) periods, so use default demand/statistics to avoid over-reacting to short delays. Choices: L set to be calculated from observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat left as defaults so the OR engine uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances high service level (profit >> holding cost implies high z*) while avoiding further over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1 \u2192 recent average 1.5). Demand has moderated from Jan historic samples; more relevant is recent realized demand (Periods 6-10 = 128,145,148,80,60) indicating a lower, more variable regime. To balance service (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1), I set lead time to the recent average of observed lead times (recent_N, N=4) so the OR backend sees the effective pipeline delay. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand periods) so the base-stock is driven by current realized demand, and variance reflects recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to recent drops in demand while the backend's cap limits excessive ordering given promised lead time uncertainty and possible lost/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=583. Recent realized demands (Periods 7-11): 145,148,80,60,71 show a lower recent mean and higher variability vs. early samples. Several concluded arrivals indicate mixed lead times (1 and 2); use observed-average lead time to let backend adapt. Choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures post-spike drop). These settings aim to size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while limiting holding cost exposure given large in-transit volume and uncertain lead-time behavior.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=583. Historical sample mean (given five samples) \u2248194/wk. Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude evidence includes 2-period arrivals; I use default lead time to keep backend aligned with promise. Using default mu_hat yields (1+L)*mean = 3*194 \u2248582, which matches current pipeline (583) so no urgent top-up; default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std of samples) keeps variability consistent with historical data. This balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost by not over-ordering given large in-transit stock and confirmed promised lead time.

Concluded history shows mixed observed lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1}); I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history is noisy with no sustained new regime; therefore use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean_all, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all) so the OR engine uses full-sample statistics and the large pipeline will cap new orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand 0, in-transit 583. Historical conclude messages show mixed actual lead times (1 and 2 periods); demand has fallen versus early-sample highs with recent realized weekly demand ~71\u201396 (many intervening stockouts). I choose L by "calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 evidence). For demand I use "recent_N" with N=5 (last 5 observed demands) to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstating order quantities; sigma_hat uses "recent_N" N=5 to measure recent volatility. These choices aim to keep pipeline coverage aligned with recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and limiting excess holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Some past shipments arrived with varying lags but confirmed LT=2 earlier; however later arrivals/losses are inconclusive. To avoid overfitting to intermittent late/missing arrivals, use defaults: promised lead time and demand statistics from all samples so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full history, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=583. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean=194 units/week. Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 2 periods. I use L=default (promised lead time=2) to align with confirmed evidence and the OR engine's expectation. For demand I choose mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture the multi-period demand (1+2=3 weeks). For volatility I choose sigma_hat=default so backend scales sample std by sqrt(1+L). These default choices are conservative given sporadic arrivals and missing sales periods, letting the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent observed weekly demands (history) average ~109 with volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=583 which should cover multiple weeks. Prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 2. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default lead time (promised=2) so OR backend uses historical mean; default mu_hat/sigma_hat let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (using sizable pipeline) against holding cost without over-committing given uncertain arrivals.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 evidence). Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand over (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 conservative given no sustained demand regime shift and sizable pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent observed demands (historic samples mean ~194) and summer season show steady mid-hundreds weekly demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=583 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly demand, no additional evidence of new lead-time regime beyond previously confirmed L=2. Many past orders after Period 4/5 were delayed/lost but carry-over already recorded. To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=2 and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps safety-stock calibrated to historical variability and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L=default to use promised (2) given confirmation. Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects current summer demand regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 3*88.4 \u2248 265.2. Volatility: use recent_N (N=5) so sigma_hat captures recent variability. This keeps the base-stock tied to current weak-but-variable summer demand while the large in-transit stock (583) will reduce ordering by the OR engine, avoiding excess holding cost.

Promised lead time = 2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2. Use default lead time so backend uses promised 2. Use default mu_hat so backend sets (1+L)*mean(all samples)=3*~194\u2248582, matching current pipeline (583) and covering L+1 periods of demand. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This configuration balances service (high fill with pipeline ~mu_hat) against holding cost by relying on observed mean and confirmed LT rather than inflating forecasts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand has fallen from spring highs (historical samples: 270,196,180,187,137) and recent concluded periods show low observed demand (last 5 concluded demands: 42,25,36, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Prior analysis confirmed lead time = 2 periods. Many recent periods showed zero arrivals despite demand, but in-transit is large so avoid overreacting to possible lost shipments now. I keep L at the promised/default (2) to align with contractual lead time and prior confirmation. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L), letting it temper ordering given the current large pipeline position.

On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline from prior orders) and many periods with zero concluded arrivals since Period 8, so conserve inventory decisions. I set L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures variability between 1\u20132). Demand forecast and volatility use 'default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging full historical demand given no clear sustained regime shift and limited recent concluded arrivals. This balances service level (using observed shorter-than-promised lead times) against holding cost given heavy in-transit stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent observed demand (early-season samples) mean=194 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=583 (covers ~3 periods of expected demand). Prior concluded history confirmed lead time = 2 periods (recorded in carry-over). I choose default lead time to trust the promised 2-period setting. Using default mu_hat yields (1+L)\xd7mean = 3\xd7mean, aligning target inventory with current pipeline (~582) so we avoid over-ordering given large in-transit. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These defaults balance service level (profit/holding ratio high: profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost while recognizing substantial existing in-transit stock and no new evidence of regime change or persistent lost shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent observed lead times from concluded arrivals are mixed (1 and 2 periods) but historically promised lead time=2; on-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Demand has trended down through summer (recent weeks low), but historical samples exist. To balance service vs holding cost while letting the OR engine use its demand statistics, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate average) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This preserves responsiveness to the mixed lead-time evidence while avoiding overfitting short recent low summer demand given limited sustained regime change evidence.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent observed demand has fallen sharply since Period 21 (summer): Periods 21-27 demands = [42,25,36,29,21,12,18], avg\u224826 vs prior Periods 1-20 avg\u2248102. Lead-time evidence (concluded arrivals) shows mixed 1\u20132 periods; use averaged observed lead time. Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the backend reconcile variability. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (covering the 7-period sustained drop), so the base-stock and caps reflect much lower expected demand and lower volatility, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period21-P27: avg demand dropped to 26 (Periods21-27) from ~103 (Periods1-20), \u2248 -75% sustained over 7 periods

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (avg \u224826 over P21\u2013P27). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 \u2014 pipeline is large but many prior orders have long delays in conclude history, so treat promised lead time as intact but be cautious. Set L to default (use promised 2). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the sustained lower regime (Periods21\u201327). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture recent reduced volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the new low-demand regime while relying on promised lead time; large in-transit mitigates urgent ordering despite delivery uncertainty.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has dropped markedly since Period21 (sustained low weekly demand ~8\u201342, avg \u224826 over P21\u2013P27). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 previously confirmed; keep default to respect supplier promise. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime: compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent N=9 samples (Periods21\u201329) to avoid overstocking given the large in-transit volume and low demand. This keeps target base_stock low, reducing holding cost while meeting service for the lower demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has declined sharply and sustained since Period 21 (avg ~26 vs ~103 earlier). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=583 units (no arrivals visible yet). Promised lead time=2 and historical conclude evidence (Period 5) confirmed L=2 earlier; no new sustained lead-time change. To reflect the low recent demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters based on the last 10 periods (Periods 21-30) where the drop is sustained. This avoids overstocking given large in-transit pipeline and low realized demand while allowing the OR backend to compute safety stock over the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has stayed at the lower regime that began Period 21 (Period21-31 avg \u2248 18). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=583. Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded messages support 2; use default L. To capture sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (Periods21-31, length=11) so the OR engine sizes base stock to the new lower mean and reduced volatility while accounting for the 1+L review+lead horizon. This avoids excessive future holds given the large pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline outstanding; several shipments appear delayed/unconcluded). Use observed lead-time average (calculate) to let backend infer current L from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 12 weeks (Periods 21\u201332) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; same 12-week window for sigma to reflect recent low volatility. These settings keep target base-stock aligned with the new low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given high holding cost exposure and large in-transit volume.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=583 units (will cover many weeks); no new evidence of lead-time change (lead time previously confirmed as 2). I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the much lower mean/variance: recent_N with N=13 (Periods 21\u201333) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new low-demand regime and avoid overstock given carrying cost and high in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 with very low weekly sales (single-digit most recent weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline covering many weeks) so we should not inflate target inventory. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Set demand forecast and volatility using recent data from the current low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201334, regime length=14) so the OR backend computes a (1+L)-period demand consistent with the sustained drop; this reduces ordering pressure given the large in-transit stock and balances service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Historical demand shows a sustained downward regime starting Period21 with very low weekly demand continuing through Period35 (recent samples: 9,6,2,2,5,3,0 and earlier low values). No new confirmed lead-time change since previous confirmation of 2. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime I use recent_N demand estimates over the recent low-demand window (N=15) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the much lower mean and volatility; keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded lead-time evidence is unchanged. These parameters will reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost given the large in-transit and sustained low demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in a new low regime since Period 21: recent weekly demands (P21-P36) average ~11 units with low variance versus historical mean ~103 (P1-P20). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline that will cover many weeks at current demand). No new confirmed lead-time change since prior confirmation of L=2. I therefore leave L at promised (default) and set demand estimates using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N over the last 16 concluded periods (P21-P36) to capture the sustained drop. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current low volatility. This keeps the OR backend focused on current low demand (reducing target base stock) while recognizing a large in-transit stock that should avoid additional ordering pressure.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (sustained drop ~-75% vs Periods1-20). Current on-hand=0 but large in-transit=583 units (must avoid over-ordering). Observed concluded lead times vary (recent concluded values = {2,1,2,1}); recent average ~1.5. I set L by averaging the last 4 observed lead times to reflect this mix of 1\u20132 period realizations. For demand I use the recent low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201337, length=17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=17 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the sustained low regime. This keeps orders aligned to current low demand while the large in-transit position prevents unnecessary additional replenishment.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (post-season): very low weekly sales (Periods 21-38). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 units \u2014 large pipeline relative to current low demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. No new lead-time evidence since previous confirms; use promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand and volatility, use recent_N over the entire low-demand regime (Periods 21-38, regime_length=18) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the reduced mean and variability and keep orders small relative to pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (sustained drop to ~26 avg through Period 27 and continued low values since). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline relative to current low demand). Concluded lead-time observations = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:2, P8:1} \u2014 recent variation but prior confirmed 2-period behavior; use a recent average to reflect observed mix. Set L by averaging the last 4 observed lead times to capture recent variability. For demand, use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime length (Periods21-39 \u2192 19 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower demand. These choices keep OR backend base-stock low (matching current weak demand) while L averaging guards against occasional 1-period arrivals and avoids ordering excessively given the large in-transit volume.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (sustained drop); last 20 concluded weekly demands are very low (Periods 21-40). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time to remain consistent with supplier terms and past confirmations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 20 samples). This down-weights the earlier high-demand era and avoids overstating needs given the large in-transit inventory; it balances service with holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (sustained drop to ~26 then falling further to single digits in recent weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and earlier evidence confirmed LT=2 (Period 5). No new sustained lead-time signals. To avoid overstock given large pipeline and low recent demand, use recent demand stats to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock for the current low-demand regime while keeping promised L. Chosen methods: L=default to trust promised lead time (and prior confirmation); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to anchor forecast to the most recent low-demand regime (caps at 20 samples); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces risk of excessive holding cost given high in-transit stock while preserving service for the current low-demand pattern.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (weeks with single-digit demand; last 7 periods average ~3.4 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline from past orders; may include delayed/lost shipments but only concluded arrivals should change lead-time inference). To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime I shrink forecast to recent data while letting the backend compute lead time from observed concludes. Selected L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (captures last 7 weeks' mean/variance). This reduces target base stock and holding exposure while preserving service via recent variability estimates.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand has been in a much lower regime since Period 21 with a sustained trough from Period 28 onward (many weeks of single- and low-double-digit demand). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=583 units (covers many future periods). Promised lead time is 2 and prior evidence (Period 5) confirmed a 2-period lead time; no new conclude messages contradicting that. To avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline and sustained low demand, keep L at default (promised). Set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to reflect the new lower mean (regime length 16 periods: Period28\u2013Period43) so the base stock targets lower demand; use the same recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect reduced volatility. These parameters reduce ordering intensity while the 583 in-transit units clear, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 28 with very low weekly sales (mostly 0\u20136 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 \u2014 large pipeline stock already covers many future periods, so avoid inflating demand forecast from early high-demand history. Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default. For demand forecasting I detect the most recent regime starting ~Period 28 through Period 44 (17 periods); choose recent_N with N=17 to base (1+L)-period demand mean and std on this low-demand regime. This keeps mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the sustained low-demand regime and prevents overordering given the large in-transit position, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period21 with sustained low weekly sales (many weeks 0\u20136). On-hand=0, in-transit=583 which already covers multiple weeks of expected demand. No recent conclude messages indicate additional lead-time change; prior evidence (Period5) confirmed LT=2. I therefore keep L as promised (default). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases the base-stock on the most recent 20 weeks of observed demand (captures the low current mean and lower volatility). This limits excess inventory given holding cost while preserving service for the small ongoing demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Recent demand has been very low and stable since Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=583 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and historical conclude evidence earlier confirmed L=2; use default promised lead time. Demand regime since Period 28 shows sustained low demand; use recent_N to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the most recent regime (N=19 periods, Periods 28-46) so orders match current low demand and avoid excess holding given holding cost $1/unit. This also avoids chasing older high-demand samples from early 2019. Large in-transit inventory means backend's capped policy will be constrained; these parameters prioritize lowering target base stock to reduce holding costs while meeting the low recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period28-46: avg demand dropped to 3.42 (Periods28-46) from 26 (Periods21-27), \u2248 -87% sustained over 19 periods
