Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 579302001 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet, and historical weekly demand samples (96,105,130,150,58) show no sustained regime shift (only 5 samples). Promised lead time is 2 periods; with no evidence of delays or lost shipments I use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps initial forecasting simple and lets the backend compute base-stock and cap given the known profit/holding cost tradeoff. Will switch to recent_N or explicit methods if future conclude messages show lead-time changes or a sustained demand shift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04) have mean ~107.8 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=166 (ordered P1) but no arrival has concluded yet \u2014 cannot confirm lead-time deviation. Use promised lead time and population-based demand stats: set L=default so backend uses promised 2; mu_hat=default to compute (1+L)*mean across all samples (captures baseline demand over review+lead window); sigma_hat=default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given limited evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=335. Promised lead time=2; orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 are expected to arrive during Periods 3\u20134 and have not yet concluded, so actual lead time cannot be inferred from conclude messages. Historical demand samples (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) are limited and show no confirmed regime shift. I choose default settings: use promised lead time and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock and cap formulas. This balances service-level (using full historical mean over the review+lead window) against holding cost without overreacting to an unconfirmed delay.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04. Demand history seed (2019-01 to 2019-02) shows mean ~107.8/week; recent observed demands in periods 1-3 are low (28,48,60) but likely understocked (on-hand=0). All three orders (P1=166, P2=169, P3=57) remain in-transit (392) with no concluded arrivals despite promised L=2, implying shipments are delayed. To avoid stockouts when those in-transit units arrive late, I explicitly set lead time to 3 (conservative). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples using the chosen L, which scales target base-stock and caps appropriately to balance profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). This approach prioritizes service (prevent lost sales) given prolonged delays while letting backend use historical variability for the safety-stock term.

Carry-over insight: Delayed shipments: orders placed P1-P3 (166,169,57) have not concluded; in-transit=392. Evidence suggests actual lead time >2 (use 3 periods conservatively).

=== Period 4 Summary ===
579302001: ordered=86, arrived=169 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=169, demand=101, sold=101, ending on-hand inventory=68

Daily Reward (R_t): $1851.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=68, in-transit=309 (ordered P1-P3 still not concluded => overdue shipments). Recent demand rose sharply in Period 4 (101) vs prior weeks (28,48,60). Conservatively treat lead time as 3 due to missing arrivals and risk of lost/delayed shipments. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime including the spike while keeping sample window small given the changepoint. These choices raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the new higher-demand regime and account for longer arrival delays, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=309; historical weekly samples (Jan) show mean ~107.8 but recent realized demand (Periods1-5 = 28,48,60,101,75) indicates a downward-shifted but volatile regime with mean ~62.4. Several early orders (P1,P3) remain unconcluded while P2\u2192P4 showed lead_time=2; shipments have been delayed intermittently\u2014conservative response is to assume longer lead time this period and size safety on recent demand. I set L explicit=3 to reflect conservative lead-time estimate given delayed arrivals; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) uses the last 5 observed demands to capture the current demand regime across review+lead; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) captures recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk from older high-Jan means while providing safety for delayed arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=341. History shows mixed signals: one order (P2\u2192P4) confirms a 2-period lead time, but several earlier orders remained unconfirmed/delayed (P1,P3,P6), so I conservatively treat effective lead time as longer than promised. To protect service given recent higher weekly demand (Periods 4-6 = 101,75,91; recent mean=89) I set L explicitly to 3 to cover potential delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest regime: mu_hat based on last 3 demands (periods 4-6) scaled by (1+L). Volatility also from the same recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed variability. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts during probable extended lead times while keeping holding cost in mind (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-01. Recent demand has risen since Period 4 (P4-P7 = 101,75,91,97); on-hand=0, in-transit=400 with history showing delayed arrivals\u2014treat lead time conservatively as 3. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delays. Use mu_hat recent_N N=4 based on the most recent regime (P4-P7) to capture the elevated demand ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover current higher demand over the longer inferred lead time while using recent data to avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=311 with several prior delayed arrivals (P1,P3 unresolved). Recent demand regime increased starting Period 4: last 5 demands (P4-P8) = [101,75,91,97,91], mean=91. I conservatively set lead time L explicit=3 to hedge against observed delayed/lost shipments. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the higher recent demand (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 4*91). I set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher base stock) given current pipeline uncertainty while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows mostly 2-period actual lead times (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8) with one 1-period outlier; no sustained >2 lead time evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (many units already inbound). Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. Demand history (samples 96,105,130,150,58) yields a moderate mean; choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to transient delayed arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2,1} (avg=1.6). On-hand=39 + in-transit=309 = 348 units in pipeline, which currently covers multiple weeks of typical demand. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized lead-time ~1.6 (method: calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples; this leverages full sample history (2019 weekly samples) while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead horizon. This keeps orders conservative given past delayed shipments but avoids overreacting to short blips since pipeline is already large.

Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=309. History shows mixed observed lead times (1\u20132 periods) but several earlier orders remain unconcluded/delayed; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover overdue shipments. Demand has shifted recently (P7\u2013P11 = 97,91,68,49,47) so I use a recent_N=5 forecast to reflect the current lower/volatile regime; sigma also uses recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward for safety against missing arrivals while keeping safety stock tied to recent demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=358; several earlier orders (P1-P3) never concluded suggesting effective lead time > promised 2. Recent demand has been volatile but lower than Jan samples; last 5 concluded demands = [91,68,49,47,104] (mean \u224871.8). To cover review+lead periods conservatively I set L explicit=3 (protect against delayed shipments). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to base the forecast on the most recent demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given observed delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding cost by using recent demand rather than older higher-Jan levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (many unconcluded shipments). Recent demand (Periods 4-14) averages ~84 units/week with volatility; shipments have frequently arrived with 2-period lead but multiple overdue shipments imply occasional longer delays. To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (Periods 4-14) rather than older Jan samples, so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility from recent behavior while accounting for extended lead time.

Concluded arrivals show mostly 1\u20132 period lead times but persistent missing arrivals indicate actual lead time > promised; I conservatively set L explicit=3 to cover delayed/lost shipments. Demand has shifted vs. the Jan samples; use recent demand to capture current regime: set mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target pipeline to protect service level given shipment delays while keeping variability grounded in recent observed demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=424 with multiple outstanding orders\u2014history shows intermittent arrivals with observed lead times of 1-2 but many delayed shipments; prior carry-over flagged delays. To be conservative, I set lead time to 3 (explicit) to cover overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 12-16 = 104,100,104,66,139) is higher and more variable than the early Jan samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. These settings increase the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated recent demand while sigma_hat from recent variability drives safety stock; this balances service (avoid stockouts given delays) against holding cost by focusing on the recent high-demand regime.

Use calculated average lead time to reflect recent mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples (leveraging full sample set: mean=107.8) to balance service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Evidence supports treating actual lead time as 3 periods to cover overdue shipments conservatively. I set L explicit=3. Demand has clearly shifted higher in recent months (Periods 13-18: 100,104,66,139,191,129) so I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current regime and have the OR backend compute (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock to improve service while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess inventory given holding cost=$1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand shows a sustained high regime (Periods 15-19: 66,139,191,129,139) so forecast should reflect elevated demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=599 (pipeline large but prior delays observed). Historical concluded arrivals indicate occasional lead-time slip; carry-over suggests conservatively using L=3. Set L explicit=3 to protect against lost/delayed shipments. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime, improving service during the surge while limiting excess inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Recent demand has been high: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16-20) = [139,191,129,139,108], mean=141.2. I conservatively set lead time L=3 (explicit) to reflect observed delays. Forecast demand across review+lead (1+L=4) uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime: mu_hat = 4 * recent mean. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings raise target base-stock to protect service during extended lead times while using recent data to avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples.

On-hand=0, in-transit=678 (large pipeline) but prior periods showed delayed shipments; carry-over suggests actual lead time longer than promised, so use a conservative L=3. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime over the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline will cap actual orders via the OR engine.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=647 with history of delayed/no arrivals beyond promised 2 periods -> evidence of longer effective lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: Periods 18-22 = 129,139,108,188,150) shows elevated, variable weekly demand (mean \u2248142). To protect service given large pipeline uncertainty, set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative above promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime. This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current demand level while sigma from recent variability sets safety stock; these choices mitigate stockouts from delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand is elevated and volatile (many weeks ~100\u2013190 units); on-hand=0, in-transit=621 which covers several weeks of demand but includes past delayed shipments. Historical concluded arrivals show occasional 1\u20132 period lead times and some prolonged delays; previous carry-over flagged delayed shipments. To be conservative I set lead time explicit=3 periods to account for observed delays and avoid stockouts. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (last 10 concluded weekly demands) so the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for current higher demand while capping order size via its cap. This balances service level (reduce lost sales from delayed arrivals) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than the full noisy history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=655; recent demand elevated (last 5 weeks avg ~133 units/week). Multiple delayed shipments earlier suggest actual lead time > promised 2; be conservative. Set L explicit=3 to account for observed shipment delays and to ensure pipeline covers longer arrival lag. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime (last 5 periods: P20-P24) so the backend\u2019s base-stock targets reflect recent elevated demand while sigma uses recent volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=655 with multiple long-undelivered orders visible in history (P1\u2013P3 remained unarrived for many periods). Concluded arrivals show occasional 1\u20132 period lead times but several shipments appear delayed/lost; conservatively treat actual lead time as 3 to cover late arrivals. Use L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to target (1+L)=4 periods of demand. For demand forecast use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) because historical sample set is small and there's no sustained, >=3-period confirmed demand regime shift beyond earlier data. These settings increase on-hand protection vs. lost/delayed shipments while keeping volatility estimation unchanged so the capped order cap still guards against excessive over-ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=633. Recent conclude (Period 26) shows an order from P23 arrived with lead_time=3, confirming longer-than-promised transit. To protect service given observed 3-period actual lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples, which increases target base-stock to cover the longer replenishment while keeping volatility treatment consistent with historical data. This balances higher fill-rate (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost by widening the ordering cushion for the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order on Period 23 arrived Period 26, lead_time=3)

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent demand has surged (Periods 24-27 demands = 117,71,114,196; recent mean=124.5/week) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=633. Historical concludes show lead time recently observed = 3 (Period 23 order arrived in Period 26). To protect service during confirmed longer lead time while limiting holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 = 4\xd7124.5) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This prioritizes meeting demand over tight inventory given large in-transit but sustained high weekly demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (Period 23 order arrived Period 26); use explicit L=3. Recent demand has shifted up (multiple high-demand weeks P21\u2013P28: 188,150,102,117,71,114,196,168) \u2014 I capture the most recent regime using the last 6 demand samples to forecast review+lead demand and volatility. Using recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand weeks; this balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost by sizing stock to recent demand patterns and the longer confirmed lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=670; history shows confirmed lead time = 3 (Period 23\u219226) and multiple delayed shipments earlier. Profit=19, holding=1 => q=0.95 (high service target). Demand has shifted up recently (periods 25-29 demands: 71,114,196,168,111) so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the new regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid underordering given lost/delayed history. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)-period demand mean/volatility over the latest regime, which raises the base-stock for high service while limiting excess inventory by using recent data rather than all-time averages.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has risen and remained high: last 5 weekly demands = [114,196,168,111,89] (mean=135.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=655 (large pipeline). Historical lead times volatile with confirmed 3-period observed at Period 27; to be conservative I set lead time=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime; with L=3 the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean over recent samples to size base stock for the current higher-demand environment while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. No new lost-shipment patterns beyond previously recorded lead-time confirmation.

Historical concluded arrivals show occasional 3-period lead times (Period 26 arrival for order on P23); recent history (many demands >> earlier Jan samples) indicates a higher-demand regime. To protect service level given observed 3-period realizations and substantial pipeline, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (~last 10 demand observations), which balances higher demand reality against holding cost.

Historical conclude messages show actual lead time has drifted to 3 periods (Period 26 showed order on P23 arrived P26) and multiple earlier delays\u2014treat lead time as 3 to avoid underordering. Demand has been elevated and variable over recent months (many weeks with demand ~100\u2013190); to capture the most recent regime I use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on last 10 demand observations to reflect current higher mean/volatility). These settings (L=3 explicit, recent_N for mu/sigma) bias orders to cover the longer observed pipeline and current high-demand regime, improving service while accepting modest extra holding cost given profit>holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=633 (multiple past delayed shipments; history contains concluded lead times including a confirmed 3-period event). Observed concluded lead times average ~1.75 periods (mix of 1,2,3). To let the OR engine internalize observed lead-time behavior I select L via calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Demand exhibits no clear recent sustained regime change vs. historical samples, so use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the backend compute base_stock while respecting the inferred lead time. This balances service level (captures observed longer lead times) against holding cost by letting the OR formula derive safety stock from profit/holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=633. Historical conclude messages (Period 26: P23\u2192P26 arrival, lead_time=3; earlier carry-over confirmed) indicate actual lead time = 3 periods. Use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend orders enough to cover (1+L) periods. With no clear recent demand regime shift beyond normal variability, use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service (covering 4 periods of demand given L=3) versus holding cost while accounting for delayed arrivals already in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=633. Historical conclude messages (notably Period 26 arrival of P23 order in Period 26 and Period 27 confirmation) show actual lead time = 3 periods; many earlier delays also indicate lead_time > promised 2. To be conservative and account for delayed arrivals, set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of historical demand samples (captures baseline demand scaled for review+lead period). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples to reflect increased uncertainty with longer lead time. These choices raise target base-stock and safety stock to protect service during the longer confirmed lead time while keeping volatility estimation tied to historical variance.

To avoid under-ordering against observed delays I set L explicit=3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving statistical grounding while the longer lead time increases required pipeline coverage given observed delays.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). History shows lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 23\u219226); recent demand has fallen and remained low over the last several weeks (Periods 35-39: 55,37,39,33,33). To avoid overstock given high in-transit (633) and low recent demand, set L explicitly to 3 (reflect confirmed lead time) and forecast demand using the most recent regime (recent_N, N=5) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean with volatility based on recent variability. This reduces ordering to match the lower current demand while respecting longer lead time and limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=633. Historical conclude messages show arrivals with lead_time=3 (e.g., order on P23 arrived P26) and earlier prolonged delays\u2014evidence supports actual lead time = 3 (longer than promised 2). I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for a 3-period transit. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the forecast and safety stock scale automatically with the longer review+lead horizon; this increases coverage for the extra period of exposure while the capped order cap and profit/holding trade-off will limit overstocking.

Historical conclude messages show several realized lead times including a confirmed 3-period observation (P23\u2192P26) and earlier delayed shipments\u2014actual lead time appears >=3. I set L using 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the sustained shift vs promised 2). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing conservative replenishment given longer lead times and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=633. Historical concluded messages (Period 26/27) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; several earlier delayed shipments also implied LT>2. To ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has recently exhibited a low baseline with a recent spike (most recent 5 periods: 33,33,28,29,68), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest regime including the spike and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders modestly upward to protect service given longer LT while keeping holding cost in check.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P23 order arrived P26, lead_time=3); earlier prolonged delays P1-P3/P4 indicated LT>2

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-09 (Period 44). Historical conclude messages (Periods 26 and 43) confirm actual lead time is 3 periods (orders observed arriving 3 periods after placement) and earlier prolonged delays support using LT=3. On-hand=0, in-transit=633; using L=3 ensures mu_hat covers review+lead demand. I use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to weight recent demand patterns (captures downward recent trend while allowing some memory of earlier spikes). sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale variability over (1+L). This balances service level (longer confirmed LT) versus holding cost by increasing forecast horizon and smoothing demand with EWMA.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (Period 23 order arrived Period 26; later confirmations) and many delayed arrivals earlier\u2014so use explicit L=3. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (Periods 40-44: 28,29,68,98,232) indicating a new higher-demand regime; use recent_N=5 to focus forecast on the latest regime ((1+L)-period demand). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This raises base_stock to protect service level given longer lead time while keeping variability estimate grounded in latest data to limit overstocking given holding cost $1/unit/period and profit $19/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=641. Historical conclude messages (notably P26 arrival of P23 order and later confirms) show actual lead time = 3 periods; multiple earlier prolonged delays support using LT=3 conservatively. To let the OR backend incorporate the confirmed longer lead time and full-sample demand signal, set L explicitly to 3 and use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This balances higher pipeline coverage for the longer LT while relying on historical demand statistics to control holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=641. Historical conclude messages (P26, P27, P43) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; several earlier prolonged delays support using LT=3 to avoid assuming arrivals too early. Recent demand shows a sustained spike starting Period 44 (Dec weeks) \u2014 periods 44-46 demands = 232,176,151 \u2014 indicating a new higher-demand regime. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 (periods 44-46) to capture the December surge when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices ensure the OR backend builds base stock for the longer confirmed lead time and targets service during the December spike while limiting excess stock by using only the recent regime for \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand spike starting Period 44: avg demand over Periods 44-46 = 186.33 (N=3), sustained for 3 periods; treat as higher-demand regime.
