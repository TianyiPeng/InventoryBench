Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; promised lead time (2) will be used. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show stable demand with mean ~241 units/week; use all samples to set demand across review+lead period and volatility. Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/std while avoiding overfitting to sparse data and handling the current zero inventory position.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (ordered in Period 1) but arrival not yet concluded \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand mean = 229.4 from available samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). Promised lead time=2 remains default. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this is conservative given no confirmed regime change and equal profit/holding (q=0.5) implying z*=0. Parameters chosen to let OR engine compute base-stock and cap using its standard formulas while accounting for promised L and full sample history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks Jan) show mean ~229.4 units/week. On-hand=0 and in-transit=599 (303+296), consistent with outstanding orders and no concluded arrivals yet; no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change because promised L=2 would produce arrivals visible only in a future conclude. I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand uncertainty to let the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to the full sample set while letting the backend cap orders using its cap formula; given profit=holding cost, service level tradeoff is balanced by the backend's q formulation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01 to 2019-02) average ~229.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=708 (matches prior orders 303+296+109) \u2014 shipments have not concluded yet but insufficient evidence to declare lead-time change. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). Use mu_hat=default to set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures 3-period demand of ~688 units). Use sigma_hat=default to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (avoid stockout while 708 in-transit covers much of forecast) versus holding cost given profit=holding so no bias toward overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Observed concluded arrival shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 => actual lead time = 2, matching promised lead time. On-hand=151, in-transit=412; some earlier orders (Period 1 and 3) have not concluded and may be lost, but evidence is not yet sustained. Historical weekly demand samples (196,255,294,212,190) give baseline demand; no recent changepoint detected. Use default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance, keeping service level calibrated to profit vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Observed actual lead time evidence: Period 4 conclude shows order placed P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (matches promised). Recent demand has fallen vs historical sample: last 3 observed demands (Periods 3-5) = 174,145,162 (avg=160.3) vs historical sample mean=229.4. This is a sustained 3-period lower regime, so I use L calculated from observed lead times, and set demand forecast to recent_3 to reflect the lower recent demand. sigma_hat also uses recent_3 to capture reduced volatility. These choices lower target base-stock to reduce holding cost while preserving service for current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 3-5 avg=160.3 vs prior sample avg=229.4 (\u221230%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=412. Observed lead times in conclude history: order from P2 arrived P4 (LT=2), order from P5 arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2014 mixed evidence. Demand has shifted down starting Period 3 and sustained through Periods 3-6 (recent avg lower). To reflect confirmed shorter/variable lead time without overcommitting to promised LT=2, use calculated average LT from observed arrivals. For demand, use recent samples to capture the new lower regime (use last 4 periods of demand) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock reflects current lower mean and volatility and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted down: historical samples mean=229.4 but periods 3-7 show sustained lower demand (P3-7 avg\u2248151.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=468 (pipeline large vs current demand). Observed concluded lead times: orders placed P2 arrived P4 (LT=2), P5 arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2192 mix of 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average to capture this. Set L by "calculate" to reflect observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the new, lower regime (last 5 periods P3\u2013P7). This reduces target base-stock and limits holding cost given large pipeline while maintaining service.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=412 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) = 2, P6 (order P5) = 1, P8 (order P7) = 1 \u2192 recent average lead time ~1.33. Demand dropped vs. historical 2019-01 series (prior mean \u2248229) \u2014 recent realized demand (Periods 4\u20138) is lower (mean \u2248153). To avoid excess ordering given big in-transit and sustained lower demand, set L by calculating the observed average lead time, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 realized demand periods (Periods 4\u20138) to capture the new lower regime. These choices reduce target base stock and cap ordering, lowering holding costs while maintaining service for current demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 showed 2 (order P2\u2192P4), P6 and P8 showed 1 (orders P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8) \u2192 recent lead-times average ~1.33. Recent demand has dropped vs historical (carry-over earlier flagged), recent concluded demands (Periods 7-9) = {135,182,65} with mean ~127.3. Given substantial in-transit stock, I avoid inflating orders by using short recent lead-time estimate and recent demand statistics to reflect the lower regime while letting the pipeline absorb service needs. Choices: L uses recent average of last 3 observed lead times to capture the apparent shortening; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to target the current lower-demand regime and reduce holding risk while pipeline is large.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=412 (matches outstanding ordered 303 from P1 and 109 from P3). Historical concluded lead times: P4 showed LT=2 (order P2), then recent concluded LTs = 1 (P6,P8,P10). Demand samples show a sustained downshift identified in carry-over (Periods 3-5 avg=160.3 vs prior 229.4) and continued moderate demand in recent periods (last samples: 143,135,182,65,59). To adapt, I set L using a recent average of observed lead times (captures shift from 2\u21921). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N to reflect the new lower-demand regime and recent variability; N chosen to cover the recent regime while respecting the N selection rules. These parameters reduce target base stock to avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost and substantial in-transit inventory, while keeping service for expected near-term demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period actual lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,1,1) with the most recent four averaging ~1.25 \u2014 I therefore use recent lead-time averaging to reflect the shift toward 1. Demand has a confirmed downshift around Period 6 (carry-over insight) so I base demand forecasts on the most recent regime. On-hand=0 and in-transit=412 (these are outstanding orders that the OR engine will not treat as arrived yet); using recent_N for mu and sigma captures the lower recent demand and reduces overstock risk. Chosen methods: L=recent_N (N=4) to capture recent actual lead-time behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=6) to use the post-changepoint demand regime (6 most recent samples). These settings bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of the current lower demand while keeping variability constrained to avoid excessive holding costs given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=412. Historical concluded lead times: 2,1,1,1 (most recent 4 \u2192 avg 1.25). Demand regime dropped around Period 6 and has stayed lower since (use recent data P6\u2013P12 for forecasting). I set L by averaging the last 4 observed lead times to reflect recent faster deliveries but allowing fractional adjustment. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 demand samples (Periods 6\u201312) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; backend will scale mu_hat by (1+L). This balances service (use recent lower mean) against holding cost given large in-transit and low profit/holding parity.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=412. Historical concluded lead times: [2,1,1,1] (mixed but mostly 1). Demand has moved down since early March (previous carry-over noted P3-5 drop) and low demands persist through Period 13. To account for shorter observed lead time while being robust to variability and the sustained lower-demand regime, I set L using recent observed lead times (average of last 4 concluded lead times). For demand I use a recent_N forecast covering the recent low-demand regime (last 11 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent. Sigma_hat uses recent_N over the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices reduce overstating demand (avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit) while reflecting shorter observed lead times; they also help the OR backend cap orders appropriately given the pipeline of 412 units and potential missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing/lost shipments suspected: Periods 11-13 show zero arrivals despite a large in-transit quantity (412) \u2014 3 consecutive periods with no arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. On-hand=0, in-transit=412 but no arrivals in P11\u2013P14 (3+ periods), consistent with prior missing-shipment suspicion. Historical weekly mean (all samples) = 229.4, but recent observed demand (Periods 11\u201314) is much lower: mean=61.25. Actual observed lead times have varied (1\u20132), but multiple consecutive non-arrivals suggest shipments may be delayed/lost; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly higher than promised. I use a recent demand window (last 4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so orders target current low demand; this reduces holding risk given holding cost equals profit. Choices: L explicit=3 to guard against additional in-transit delays/losses; mu_hat recent_N N=4 to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on latest low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent low-volatility demand and avoid overstating safety stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=412 but no arrivals observed in Periods 11-15 (3+ consecutive periods) \u2014 sustained missing shipments risk. Promised L=2 is unreliable given prolonged non-arrival; choose explicit longer lead time to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover and avoid stockouts when/if shipments resume. Demand has been low recently (Periods 13-15: 52, 61, 49) and a short recent window best captures current regime; use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 3 samples, keeping safety proportional to the explicit L. This balances service (avoid lost sales if in-transit actually arrives) against holding cost by increasing lead-time assumption conservatively while anchoring demand to the latest low-demand regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=412 but no arrivals observed since Period 10 \u2014 consistent with earlier missing/lost shipment signal. Recent demand (Periods 11-16) = [54,78,52,61,49,38], avg\u224855.3. Because of suspected lost/delayed shipments, set L explicitly to 3 to account for possible extended lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the new lower demand regime observed since Period 6 (sustained ~55 units/week), so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the most relevant samples, reducing overordering against uncertain pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent observed demand has been much lower than early samples (Periods 11\u201317 demand series: 54,78,52,61,49,38,29; recent average ~51.7) and this lower regime is sustained for 7 periods. There is a large in-transit quantity (412) and prior carry-over flagged missing/lost shipments; to be conservative about coverage I increase assumed lead time slightly to 3 periods. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 demand observations (recent_N, N=7) so forecasts reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and reduced variability, helping the OR backend target lower base-stock and avoid excessive holding cost given profit=holding. This balances service against holding cost while acknowledging possible delayed/lost arrivals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=412 but no arrivals since Period 6 and many concluded periods with zero arrivals \u2192 strong evidence of missing/lost shipments or extended lead time. Historical concluded lead times were mixed (1 and 2), but recent absence of arrivals for many periods suggests actual lead time may be longer or shipments lost. To protect availability while acknowledging uncertainty I set L explicitly to 3 (longer than promised 2) so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. Demand history (Periods 1\u201318) mean demand = 108 units/week; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat with L=3 yields (1+L) aggregation and volatility scaling so the optimizer raises target stock to cover the longer review+lead horizon. This balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by increasing forecast horizon (to avoid lost sales given large unseen in-transit) while relying on backend caps to limit extreme over-ordering.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 538. Historical concluded lead times observed: one 2-period (P4) and one 1-period (P6) \u2192 recent average ~1.5. Multiple consecutive periods (P11\u2013P18) showed zero arrivals despite in-transit quantities, consistent with earlier lost-shipment suspicion; however only two concluded lead-time samples exist so use backend-calculated average of observed lead times. Demand baseline anchored to provided historical samples (mean \u2248229.4). To keep the backend consistent with observed lead-time variability and historical demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (using observed lead-time avg) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine derive the base-stock with the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=538. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 2-period in P4 and multiple 1-period arrivals in P6,P8,P10). No new concluded evidence since Period 10 (Periods 11\u201320 show many zero arrivals), so do not change promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201320 = 54,78,52,61,49,38,29,14,25,14) is substantially lower than earlier samples and is a sustained low-demand regime; use recent_N=10 to capture current mean/variance. sigma_hat also set to recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep L at the promised default to avoid assuming lost shipments while mu_hat/sigma_hat lower the base-stock to reduce holding cost given weak recent demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has collapsed vs earlier history: last 3 concluded demands = 25,14,12 (avg ~17). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 \u2014 many prior shipments overdue/missing (sustained no-arrival pattern previously flagged). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time (recent concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period lag with one 2-period), and I anchor demand forecast to the most recent regime using recent_N (N=3) so mu_hat reflects current low demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent low variability. These choices avoid overstocking against older higher-demand samples while letting OR cap/order considering pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=538. Concluded lead-time evidence: arrivals show lead_times = {2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 1 (P7\u2192P8), 1 (P9\u2192P10)} \u2192 average \u22481.25. Historical demand sample mean (provided) =229.4. Recent periods show many zero arrivals (possible lost shipments) but demand observations during stockouts are censored and not reliable for demand re-estimation. To remain conservative with service while avoiding excess holding cost, set L to the calculated average lead time (backend will use observed lead times to compute 1.25). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) based on full historical samples; this leverages the full-sample demand mean (229.4) rather than censored recent low sales. This balances service level versus holding cost given uncertainty and suspected shipment losses.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but arrivals have been zero since Period 11 \u2192 lost shipments confirmed through Period 23. Demand has been in a lower regime recently (Periods 19-23 demands = 25,14,12,17,14; recent mean \u224816.4). Given confirmed lost in-transit stock, do not infer a longer realized lead time; use promised lead time (default). To capture the recent low-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent_N with N=5 (covers Periods 19-23). Use matching recent_N volatility over the same 5 periods. These choices keep L at the promised value so the OR engine uses its assumed LT, while mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower-demand regime to avoid over-ordering against potentially lost pipeline stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 3\u20135 shift and recent weekly demands are small (last 5 demands ~14,12,17,14,28). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but no arrivals observed since Period 10 so those in-transit units are likely lost; however lead-time inference must rely only on concluded arrivals. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,1} (avg=1.25). I set L using recent_N over the 4 most recent observed lead times to reflect the empirically short lead times (captures 1 vs 2). For demand I use recent_N over the last 5 demand samples to capture the sustained lower-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Sigma is also recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep target base-stock conservative to avoid excess holding cost given holding=profit, while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering when lead times were actually short.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical concludes show lead times of 2,1,1,1 (avg \u22481.25) and many subsequent lost arrivals; in-transit=538 appears from lost shipments. Recent demand has dropped markedly: last 5 demand samples (Periods 21-25) = [12,17,14,28,29], mean \u224820. Use calculated lead time (backend average of observed lead times) to let engine infer actual recent LT. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and recent volatility, so base_stock scales to current low demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but no arrivals recorded for many periods (missing/lost shipments confirmed in history). Recent realized customer demand has been lower than the early-sample mean (sustained lower regime since Period 6). Because missing shipments suggest unreliable pipeline, I set L explicitly longer than the promised to force the OR engine to plan for a longer coverage window. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent lower-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and volatility estimates). These choices reduce the risk of overstocking if delayed shipments reappear, while allowing the OR backend to target service with recent demand statistics.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but prior periods 11-22 showed no arrivals (confirmed lost/delayed shipments). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 6; recent_week demands (Periods 23-27) average ~34.4 units. To be conservative against continued shipment delays, I set lead time explicitly longer than the promised 2 (L=3). I use a recent_N (N=5) demand estimate for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant for upcoming periods) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to size base_stock to current lower demand while accounting for extended delivery risk so the OR engine orders enough to cover (1+L) review+lead demand without gross overstocking.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been low (many weeks <60) after an earlier regime drop. On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but historical conclude messages (Periods 11\u201322) show no arrivals \u2014 missing/lost shipments were previously confirmed; however lead-time inference must rely only on concluded arrivals. Observed concluded lead times (non-lost arrivals) = {2,1,1,1} \u2192 average ~1.25. I choose L by "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times. For demand I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance adjusted for the inferred lead time; this balances service level (captures demand over review+lead) while avoiding overreacting to recent zeros that were caused by lost shipments rather than demand collapse.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but long history (Periods 11\u201329) shows no arrivals \u2192 missing/lost shipments confirmed. Demand history is noisy due to prolonged stockouts; recent observed demand (Periods 24\u201329) shows nonzero weekly demand (28,29,43,58,63,40) so I'll base demand forecast on the most recent samples. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded lead-time observations are mixed and lost shipments are best handled by avoiding over-reliance on in-transit; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand level and volatility while ignoring older regime shifts. This balances service (capture recent demand increases) against holding cost and the risk that the large in-transit quantity may never arrive.

To avoid overreacting to lost-arrival periods (which suppress observed sales), I retain the promised lead time and use the global-sample defaults for demand and volatility so the OR backend computes base-stock from the original demand sample statistics rather than the corrupted recent zero-arrival periods. This balances service level risk vs holding cost given confirmed lost shipments.

To avoid over-ordering into a possibly unreliable pipeline, I conservatively set lead time longer than promised. I leave demand estimation to the backend default (uses all historical precomputed samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full-sample baseline scaled by (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 -> low safety stock).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 with a history of long/confirmed missing arrivals (Periods 11-22 showed no arrivals despite in-transit). To avoid inflating inventory (holding cost = profit), do not inflate lead time estimate beyond promised; treat lead time as explicit=2 so backend uses promised review+lead horizon. Demand has risen recently (Periods 28-32 = 63, 40, 92, 116, 116); use a recent_N forecast (N=5) to reflect the current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so ordering responds to the most recent pattern rather than older higher pre-shift samples. This keeps orders aligned to observed recent demand and avoids over-ordering given large stranded in-transit quantity.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 P34. On-hand=0, in-transit=538 but no arrivals since P11 -> prior carry-over flagged missing/lost shipments. Recent concluded lead-times (observed arrivals) are mostly 1 with an earlier 2; use calculate to let backend average observed lead-times. Demand has sharply increased in the most recent weeks (last 5 demands: 40,92,116,116,319) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise target stock to cover the (review+lead) period demand while keeping volatility grounded in recent data given lost in-transit risk.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-10-07 (Period 35). Large sustained absence of concluded arrivals since Period 11 with in-transit=538 suggests lost/delayed shipments, but prior concluded lead times were 2 and 1; I keep lead time explicit=2 (promised) to align with contract and OR assumptions. Demand has recently spiked (Periods 30-34: 92,116,116,319,272) so I forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high mean and volatility. This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and safety stock so orders/pipeline better cover upcoming demand despite potential lost shipments; using recent_N focuses inventory where recent demand justifies it while keeping L aligned to promised lead time for OR calculations.

Recent demand has spiked in the last 3 weeks (Periods 33-35: 319, 272, 315), indicating a new high-demand regime. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed and lost shipments make observed lead-time unreliable for averaging; using promised lead time lets the OR backend operate with its known contract. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime and raise base_stock accordingly. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect elevated short-term volatility. This prioritizes service for the recent surge while recognizing shipment uncertainty in rationale and carry-over.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 31-36 = 116,116,319,272,315,275) indicating a new high-demand regime vs earlier lows. On-hand=0, in-transit=883 but history shows many missing arrivals earlier; concluded arrivals indicate observed lead times mostly 1 period with one 2-period observation (observed lead times: 2,1,1,1,1 \u2192 avg\u22481.2). To balance high recent demand and high volatility while conservatively estimating lead time, set L via observed average (calculate). Forecast demand using recent data to capture the current high regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (Periods 31\u201336). Match sigma_hat to the same recent window to capture increased variability: recent_N N=6. These choices push the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand, while sigma from recent variability informs safety stock sizing.

Recent demand has spiked (Periods 33-37 demands = 319,272,315,275,345; mean\u2248305). To balance service vs holding cost given high recent demand and uncertain arrivals, I set lead time estimate using recent 5 observed lead times and base-stock demand/volatility using the most recent 5 demand samples so the OR engine targets current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to further changes.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has shifted recently (large spikes since Period 30); to capture current regime I use recent_N=7 for demand mean and volatility (focus on the most recent two-month window). These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N=7, sigma_hat recent_N=7) steer the OR engine to target stock for the current higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for the promised L=2 when actual arrivals have mostly been ~1 period. No new shipment-loss signal strong enough to add or change carry-over.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=571. Historical concluded lead times: {2,1,1,1,1,3} (last observed = 3). There have been extended periods of missing arrivals earlier (Periods 11\u201322) but recent concluded arrivals include a 3-period lead time, so actual lead time appears variable. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures variability and recent 3-period observation). Demand and volatility will use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine combines long-run demand evidence with the inferred lead time; this balances service level (accounts for longer observed lead_time) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. Recent demand has surged since Period 33 (week of 2019/9/23) \u2014 sustained high weekly demand (Periods 33-40) motivating a short-term recent-based forecast. Lead-time observations from concluded arrivals: observed lead times = [2,1,1,1,1,3] \u2192 average ~1.5; use calculated average to let the backend reconcile variability. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time. For demand, detect changepoint at Period 33 (regime length 8 periods from 33\u201340); use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling and volatility are driven by the high-demand regime. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=571 \u2014 policy will net out pipeline against the higher base stock; using recent samples avoids overcommitting to obsolete low-demand history and helps balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand history shows large, volatile weekly demand (many zeros earlier, then sustained high weeks in Oct\u2013Nov). On-hand=0, in-transit=992 (large pipeline but many past periods showed delayed/lost arrivals). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,1,1,3} -> average ~1.5. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures variability vs promised=2). For demand scale and uncertainty I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) using the full sample history; this balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=992. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Periods 33-42 (large weekly spikes, regime length ~10), and lead times have been variable with occasional multi-period delays but no new confirmed permanent change since prior insights. I keep L at the promised lead time to let the OR engine use contract lead_time while using recent demand to capture the late-season surge. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the most recent 10-week high-demand regime so base_stock will increase appropriately; this balances service (avoid stockouts during peak) against holding cost given profit=holding (service level weight 0.5).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). SKU 608776002 has on-hand=141, in-transit=723. Historical arrivals show varied actual lead times (observed W={2,1,1,1,1,3,2}); recent concluded arrival (Period 43) had lead_time=2. Missing/lost shipments were previously confirmed (Periods 11-22). To let the OR engine infer average realized lead time from observed concludes, I set L=calculate. Demand forecast and uncertainty will use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so they automatically scale with the computed L and incorporate the full sample history; this keeps ordering responsive to the long history while letting the engine cap orders per its policy to limit exposure given high in-transit. Methods chosen: L=calculate to capture realized lead-time average; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to use all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L).

Demand history seed mean (provided samples) = 229.4 units/week; current on-hand=0, in-transit=723 (large pipeline; previous periods show long gaps and some lost shipments historically). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time (captures actual variability vs promised 2). For demand I use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) \u2014 this leverages the seeded historical mean while scaling for the estimated lead+review period. sigma_hat=default to let backend scale sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance maintaining service (use observed lead time) while avoiding overreacting to in-transit noise; the OR engine cap will limit order size given observed demand/lead variability.

Recent concluded lead times (most recent 4): 1,3,2,2 \u2192 average 2.0, so use recent_N for L to reflect observed faster/variable arrivals rather than default promised 2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 33 (large Oct\u2013Dec sales); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13 demand samples (regime 33\u201345 length=13) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using observed recent volatility for sigma_hat so the OR backend sets safety stock proportional to actual recent variability.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1111. Recent realized demand (Periods 42-46) shows elevated weekly demand (682,280,299,420,380) driven by late-year seasonality; earlier missing-shipment episodes were confirmed previously but recent concludes show arrivals at promised cadence. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because recent concluded arrivals align with the promised lead time and lost-shipment patterns are historical rather than currently persistent. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (targets the last 5 observed demands) so the OR engine increases the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the current seasonal spike while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during season) against holding cost given profit=holding so we aim for moderate service uplift based on recent data.
