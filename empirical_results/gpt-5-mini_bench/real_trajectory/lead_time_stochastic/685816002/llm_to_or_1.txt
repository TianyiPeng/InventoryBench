Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). SKU is a basic men's T-shirt with stable historical weekly demand (samples mean = 66.2 units/week from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrival history yet, so no evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts. Use promised lead time and baseline demand/volatility estimates to let the OR backend compute base_stock conservatively ((1+L)\xd7all-sample mean) while avoiding premature explicit adjustments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=81 (ordered in P1); Period1 conclude shows ordered=81 arrived=0 so shipment not yet concluded \u2014 insufficient evidence to declare lead-time change or lost order (need 3+ periods). Use promised lead time (default) so backend computes (1+L)*mean from full sample history (captures baseline weekly mean ~66.2). Keep sigma default to reflect historical variability. This balances service level (use full-sample mean over 3-period review+lead) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=177, two recent orders (P1=81, P2=96) have not yet concluded \u2014 insufficient concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change. Historical demand samples (5 weeks through 2019-02-04) have mean \u224866.2 units/week. I retain the promised lead time (default) and use default demand-volatility settings so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy simple while awaiting concluded arrivals; it balances service level (uses full-sample mean over 3 periods) vs. holding cost conservatively.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=278. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 (orders=81,96,101) but arrived=0 each period \u2014 shipments overdue versus promised L=2. This suggests shipments are delayed/lost; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. mu_hat uses default so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture full review+lead demand given the longer L. sigma_hat uses default to scale demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices preserve service by raising target stock for the extended lead time while the holding cost ($1) is moderate relative to profit ($19), so higher service is justified until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Probable lead-time increase: orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not conclude (arrived=0) beyond promised L=2; treat effective lead time as 3 periods until contradicted.

Daily Profit: $1558.00, Daily Holding Cost: $14.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1544.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=14, in-transit=300. Recent concludes: Period4 shows arrival=96 (ordered P2, lead_time=2) but earlier P1/P3 orders lacked concludes; previous carry-over flagged a probable LT increase to 3 and policy is to treat LT=3 until contradicted. I therefore set L explicit=3 to protect service given large pipeline and delayed/uncertain shipments. Demand history mean=66.2; using default mu/sigma (which compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) balances service level against $1 holding cost and $19 profit per unit while the pipeline uncertainty resolves.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=380. Recent conclude history shows delayed/absent arrivals earlier (Periods 1-3) and Period 4 arrival consistent with longer latency; shipments remain unreliable. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the probable extended effective lead time (protects against expecting same-period arrivals). Demand has recently been higher than the older samples (recent demands: 96,102,119,82,65; mean=92.8). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current regime and scale by (1+L) in the backend. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These choices increase target pipeline to cover the longer lead time and recent elevated demand while using recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Historical weekly demand samples avg=66.2 (samples: 76,64,73,53,65). On-hand=24, in-transit=359 => pipeline inventory=383, which comfortably covers (1+L)*mean demand (3*66.2\u2248198.6). Recent conclude messages show mixed lead-time evidence (one arrival with L=2, one with L=1) so no sustained change from promised L=2. Use default (promised) lead time to let OR backend apply its base-stock calculation with full-sample demand stats; this avoids overreacting to transient/partial delays while the large pipeline already protects service level. sigma_hat default keeps volatility based on full-sample std to balance safety stock vs holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand (Periods 3-7) shows mean ~76.8/week with moderate variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=359 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show inconsistent arrivals and prior note of effective LT=3; no new contrary evidence in latest concludes. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed/probable lead-time increase (ensures pipeline coverage for longer arrival lag). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 3-7) where demand averaged ~76.8; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean over these 5 weeks to size orders for the review+lead horizon. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher safety stock to avoid stockouts given longer effective lead time and large but uncertain demand, while avoiding overly large holdings by using only recent data. No explicit numeric 'value' fields provided so backend computes the scaled mean and std.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has been high and volatile (historical weekly samples avg ~70s; recent demands up to 128). On-hand=0, in-transit=333 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) = 2, P6 (order P5) = 1, P8 (order P6) = 2. These three confirmed observations do not support the prior assumed persistent L=3; use a data-driven average lead time. I select L via calculate (backend will average observed lead times). For demand and uncertainty, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; given large in-transit pipeline and volatile demand, defaults balance service vs holding cost without overfitting short-term spikes.

Carry-over insight: Retire prior probable L=3: recent concluded lead_times = [2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P8)], average = 1.67 \u2192 no sustained 3-period lead time signal.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded arrivals show lead_times = [2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P8)] \u2192 average \u22481.67, so use calculated lead time (let backend average observed lead times). Demand has risen recently (last 5 periods P5\u2013P9 = 65,56,62,128,100; mean \u224882.2) vs older baseline; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new regime. Volatility appears higher due to the 128/100 spikes, so use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=333; chosen parameters increase target stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while accounting for the observed lead-time behavior and avoiding understocking given delayed arrivals history.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been high and variable (most recent concluded demands: P8=128, P9=100, P10=90, P11=158). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times = [2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P8), 2 (P10)] \u2192 avg \u22481.75, so use calculated average lead time rather than the promised default to reflect realized behavior. Given volatile/high recent demand but substantial in-transit stock, use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (capturing realized lead time) against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has been high and volatile (recent concluded demands P8-P12 = 128,100,90,158,129) vs historical Jan samples (mean ~66). Pipeline shows 344 in-transit, on-hand 0; several past orders experienced mixed lead times (observed lead_times = 2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg ~1.67). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1-2 period pattern). For demand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility on the most recent 5 realized demands, which captures the elevated recent demand regime and higher variance and keeps inventory responsive while avoiding overstock given substantial in-transit volume.

Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead_times = [2 (P4),1 (P6),2 (P8),2 (P10),2 (P13)] \u2014 no sustained 3-period lead time; use observed average lead time. Demand history (samples from 2019-01) used for baseline; with current high pipeline I keep demand and volatility estimation on all samples so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (use avg observed L) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/20. Recent demand regime is much higher (~100s) versus the older small-sample historical series; pipeline is large (on-hand=0, in-transit=398) so avoid inflating orders. Observed concluded lead_times are mostly 2 (with one 1), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 concluded demand samples: Periods 10-14) to capture the current high-demand regime for (1+L) horizon. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings steer the OR engine toward a base-stock sized for current demand while the calculated L captures the realized average lead time from concluded arrivals and avoids over-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Recent concluded lead_times (from conclude messages) are mostly 2 with one 1 \u2192 average lead time below promised 2. Recent demand has been high and volatile (many weeks >100). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures realized variability). For demand parameters I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this balances service vs holding cost given high profit ($19) relative to holding ($1). No new lost-shipment pattern confirmed here.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded arrivals show typical observed lead_times mostly 2 (with some 1s); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has shifted up substantially since early March (sustained across 13 periods); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime using the last 10 demand samples. On-hand=0 with in-transit=445 (large pipeline) so parameters that reflect higher demand reduce stockouts while backend cap will limit excessive orders. Methods chosen: L=calculate to reflect observed lead-time history; mu_hat=recent_N (N=10) to forecast (1+L)-period demand from recent samples; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=10) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4 (2019-03-04): Periods 4-16 mean demand = 108.9 (n=13) vs baseline Jan samples mean = 66.2 \u2192 +64% sustained increase (13 periods).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times cluster at 2 with occasional 1; I'll let backend estimate average lead time from observed concludes. To capture the sustained higher demand I use a recent-N demand estimate over the post-changepoint regime (N=14, Periods 4\u201317). I match sigma to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR engine set a higher base-stock for the new regime while letting its lead-time calculation adapt to the mixed 1\u20132 period observations; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 4 (mean ~109) vs baseline ~66. On-hand=0, in-transit=450 (large pipeline). Lead times observed in concluded messages vary but average ~1.86; use calculated average. Use recent-demand estimates over the post-changepoint regime to capture the sustained higher demand (N=15 periods from Period 4 onward). This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts during elevated demand) while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=418 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead_times show mostly 2 with occasional 1 (recent sequence of concluded L: 2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1) \u2192 effective recent mean \u22481.8. Demand has shifted up since Period 4 (sustained higher demand); use recent demand window to capture new regime. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent concluded lead times (gives ~1.8). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201316 and subsequent high-demand samples), so the backend will size base stock for the elevated demand while capping orders via its cap parameter. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand and substantial in-transit) against holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=462 \u2014 sizeable pipeline but arrivals from recent orders have been inconsistent earlier; several concluded lead times are 1\u20132 periods (no sustained >2 signal). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 variability). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained increase); to reflect that while emphasizing the most recent pattern I use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (balances responsiveness and sample robustness). This raises the (1+L)-period demand estimate and uses recent volatility to set safety stock, improving service given elevated demand while controlling holding cost using the capped order cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead_times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (recent avg ~1.67) so use calculated average to reflect observed reality rather than promised=2. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 4 (mean \u2248109 vs baseline \u224866); therefore forecast demand using the recent regime (use last 18 samples covering the post-change regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility. These choices let the backend set a base-stock that reflects the higher demand while capping orders by its cap, and using the observed lead-time average reduces over/under-ordering from mismatched lead-time assumptions.

Historical concluded lead_times show variability but recent average <2 (prior analysis avg\u22481.67); promised L=2 still reasonable but use observed-average via calculate. Demand rose sharply starting Period 4 and has remained elevated; use recent demand window to capture the new regime. Choose: L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 20 demand periods capturing the sustained +64% regime shift; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service needs from elevated demand while avoiding excessive holdings given large in-transit quantity.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime since Period 4 with much larger weekly demand (confirmed in prior carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=455 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time to keep model aligned with supplier promise while pipeline is sizable. For demand parameters, use recent_N with N=13 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use the 13-period regime identified earlier) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the new mean/volatility rather than the low-Jan baseline. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded lead times cluster at 2 (with occasional 1); no sustained >2 signal, so use promised L. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (mean \u2248109). On-hand=0, in-transit=474 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with 1\u20132 period variability. Set L to default (promised=2) to match supplier promise and OR engine assumptions. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples within the post-change regime) so the base-stock reflects current elevated mean and volatility while smoothing short-term noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute z* using profit/holding and apply the capped order cap.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical concluded lead_times vary (many 2, some 1, one 3) \u2014 no new sustained lead-time change beyond previously recorded signals. A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 4 (mean increased ~+64% vs Jan baseline) and persists; recent demands remain elevated. To reflect observed lead-time variability use averaged observed lead time (calculate). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 20 demand samples, improving service while accounting for holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead_times (most recent): P27=2, P26=3, P23=2, P22=2, P19=1 \u2192 recent average \u22482; no sustained >2 signal so use recent_N L estimate. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 4 (sustained; carry-over noted), so base-stock should be driven by recent high-demand samples. Choose L: recent_N (N=5) to capture recent lead-time variability (avg\u22482). Choose mu_hat: recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise. Choose sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=455 \u2014 sizable pipeline but recent history shows variable concluded lead times (mostly 1\u20133, avg ~1.7) and a sustained higher-demand regime that started Period 4 (mean ~109 vs baseline ~66). I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20133). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime and recent seasonality (reduces weight of the low-Jan baseline). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand variation. These choices align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the sustained elevated demand while L='calculate' lets the backend infer the effective lead time from observed concludes; together they balance service level against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (noted previously); to capture recent elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N over the last 20 demand observations to form mu_hat and sigma_hat, which biases the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts while the pipeline (426 units) is reconciled. Using recent_N for sigma captures current variability and prevents under-ordering given holding cost is low relative to profit.

Recent concluded lead-times vary (recent observed lead_times include 2,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,3,2,3); no sustained shift away from ~2 so use calculated average lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (mean ~109 vs baseline ~66); use a recent_N forecast to capture the post-changepoint demand (use most recent 20 periods of the high regime) and match volatility to that same window. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher-demand regime while the calculated L reflects observed lead-time variability; large in-transit reduces immediate order quantity via the backend cap.

Recent history shows mixed 1\u20133 period realizations with overall mean \u22481.93, so use calculate to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 4 already recorded in carry-over insights, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the selected L).

Recent concluded lead times have varied but center near 2; promised L=2 remains reasonable. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (avoids overreacting to intermittent 3-period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise from older baseline data; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to match the higher regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits new ordering risk, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Demand regime increased from early March and has remained elevated; recent variability present. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures variable history). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures post-changepoint higher mean and recent variability) while avoiding overweighting very old January samples. This keeps base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand but tempered by the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess holding cost.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent sustained high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=13 (regime length since Period 4 to Period 16 was 13 periods, and subsequent history aligns with elevated demand). This provides (1+L)-period demand estimates and volatility tuned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while relying on default L to respect supplier promise and avoid overordering despite delayed past arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=439. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 4 (documented in carry-over insights): recent long-run demand >> Jan baseline. Pipeline (439) is large relative to typical weekly demand but arrival timing uncertain; use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for sporadic lead-time noise. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=13 (the documented sustained regime length) so the OR engine forecasts using the elevated regime mean/variance over the review+lead period (1+L weeks), balancing higher service need against holding cost given large in-transit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained +64% vs Jan baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=439 (large pipeline). No recent sustained change in observed lead times; use promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent weeks' behavior (N=20). Use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to meet elevated demand and large pipeline) against holding cost by relying on observed pipeline plus conservative recent-demand-based base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=439. Historical concluded lead times have bounced but no sustained shift above promised L=2; use promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained higher regime starting Period 4 (Periods 4-16 mean=108.9 vs baseline ~66), so use a recent-window demand estimate reflecting the higher regime. I choose recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the confirmed elevated-demand regime length). These parameters balance service (covering the elevated demand regime) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume; using recent regime stats avoids diluting the forecast with pre-shift low demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): on-hand=0, in-transit=439. Recent concluded lead_times (mix of 1\u20133) average <2 \u2192 use calculated average lead time so backend infers current effective L from observed conclues. Demand has shifted since early periods; to capture the most recent demand level and volatility I use recent_N=10 (last 10 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and std reflect current demand rather than older baseline. This also avoids over-ordering against older high-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity (439) will be reconciled by the OR engine when arrivals conclude. Methods chosen balance service (using recent demand) with holding cost (not inflating safety stock unnecessarily).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent concluded lead-times are variable; no sustained shift away from promised L=2. I'll use promised lead time (default) so the OR engine uses L=2. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing older low-baseline periods. Sigma also set to recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture elevated mean) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=439. Profit/holding gives q\u22480.95 so backend will target a high service level; large pipeline already provides coverage vs (1+L) demand. Recent concluded lead-times are mixed but no sustained new shift since prior notes, so keep promised lead time. Demand history shows a sustained regime shift earlier (Periods 4\u201316) but later data are censored by stockouts; to remain responsive to recent realized demand while smoothing noise I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3). Sigma left to backend default to reflect long-run variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance higher service level driven by profit with caution given heavy in-transit inventory and uncertain recent arrivals.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=439 units (covers multiple periods of demand); several recent concluded periods show variable lead times (1\u20133). Use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical L from observed concludes, and use recent_N (N=13) demand estimates to capture the sustained post-Period-4 demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to service the higher demand while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=439. Historical concluded lead_times show variability (1\u20133); no sustained multi-period deviation from promised L=2 since Period 9. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift from Period 4\u201316 (mean\u2248108.9 vs baseline\u224866.2); recent months remain higher and volatile. To let the OR engine infer persistent lead time from observed conclusions, set L='calculate' (average observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint higher demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. For volatility use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand variance. These choices keep the backend responsive to confirmed lead-time evidence while biasing forecasts toward the elevated demand regime to avoid stockouts given large in-transit volume and high profit relative to holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=439 \u2014 large pipeline exists though many prior orders showed variable lead times; no new sustained lead-time change confirmed. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P40-P44 = [48,55,207,64,80]) averages \u224890.8 with elevated variance (holiday spike at P42). To balance service vs holding cost given high pipeline, keep promised lead time and size forecast to recent demand: set L=default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to react to the current elevated short-term mean (keeps orders moderate while in-transit stock arrives). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and let backend compute safety stock accordingly.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 4 (Periods 4-16 mean=108.9 vs baseline Jan mean=66.2, +64%) so use a recent-window demand estimate. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (pipeline large vs typical weekly demand) so we avoid inflating lead-time estimate; use promised lead time. Choose L=default to keep promised L=2. Choose mu_hat=recent_N with N=13 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use last 13 relevant demand samples since the changepoint). Keep sigma_hat=default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to let backend compute safety stock given variance across history. These parameters balance service (capture the sustained higher mean) while avoiding over-ordering because substantial pipeline inventory (461) already exists.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=461. Recent concluded lead_times (historic arrivals) average \u22481.93 (~2) so I let backend calculate average lead time (captures observed variability and recent 1\u20133 period outcomes). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (carry-over) so use default demand/volatility settings ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat over full sample history; large in-transit stock will be considered by the pipeline subtraction when ordering.
