Demand analysis: recent 12-week average (P35\u2013P46) \u2248 77 units/week but volatile (includes P42=207 spike). Prior documented regime shifts: +45% up in P4\u201313, then down to ~59 in P35\u201340; recent weeks show variability but no new sustained regime (need \u22653 consistent periods). Lead time & pipeline: historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed 1,2,3) and earlier lost/delayed shipments (P1,P3). Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 618 units (pipeline large; matches prior notes). Risk assessment: 618 in-transit covers multiple weeks of demand (618 / ~77 \u2248 8 weeks); holding cost = $1/unit/period makes excess pipeline expensive if arrivals consolidate. Given uncertain but substantial pipeline and no confirmed new demand regime, avoid adding inventory. Final action: place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost while waiting for in-transit shipments to conclude and reveal actual arrivals/lead-times.",
