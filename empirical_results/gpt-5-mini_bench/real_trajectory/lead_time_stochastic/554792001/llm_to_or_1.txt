Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 554792001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Historical weekly demand samples: [7,33,28,63,45] (mean=35.2). No evidence of a sustained demand or lead-time shift. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample and balances service vs holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=130 (orders 70+60) \u2014 shipments outstanding but not yet concluded; no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviation. Use promised lead time (default) because there is no confirmed lead-time observation. Use default demand/volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level using full historical sample while avoiding overreacting to limited short-term noise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=134 (orders P1=70, P2=60, P3=4). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) mean \u224835.2. Promised lead time is 2 but only Periods 1\u20133 conclude are visible; P1 order failed to arrive by its expected conclude (one missed arrival), but this is single-period evidence so do not alter lead-time estimate yet. I choose default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with the promise. Use default demand estimates (no recent changepoint detected): mu_hat default yields (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, sigma_hat default yields sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run sample stats while the pipeline (134) will be considered by the backend when capping orders.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has averaged ~38 units/week over the last 4 periods (29,47,38,38) vs older historical samples mean ~35.2 \u2014 modest uptick. Pipeline = on-hand 22 + in-transit 74 = 96 units; with promised lead time 2, review+lead period = 3 weeks and recent demand*3 \u2248 114, so pipeline is slightly short. Period 4 conclude shows arrival of Period 2 order with lead_time=2, confirming promised lead time. I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (use evidence-based average), use a recent-4 demand estimate for mu_hat to capture the modest recent increase, and keep sigma_hat default to reflect overall sample variability. These choices help the OR backend target service (through a recent demand-driven base stock) while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=115. Historical concluded lead time shows L=2 (Period 2\u21924). Recent demand (Periods1-5): 29,47,38,38,34 \u2014 stable middle-high weekly demand. To ensure coverage of current review+lead (1+L=3) periods and maintain service given confirmed L=2, set L by calculating observed lead times and use default demand/volatility (all samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service (protects against stockouts with pipeline=115) versus holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent on-hand=0, in-transit=89. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-6 concludes) average ~38.5, slightly above older historical mean (~35). Lead-time observations: one 2-period (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed signals. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the 1 and 2 period observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to weight the most recent six realized demands ((P1\u2013P6) mean \u224838.5) so the base-stock reflects the recent upward drift. For volatility I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters prioritize meeting recent demand while keeping holding cost in check given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=126. Recent concluded lead-times inconsistent: Period4 showed lead_time=2 (order P2\u2192P4) and Period6 showed lead_time=1 (order P5\u2192P6). To be conservative I average the last 2 observed lead times to capture uncertainty and potential variability. Demand has been steady recently (recent demands: 29,47,38,38,34,45,43); no strong sustained regime shift detected, so I use a recent_N forecast over the last 7 periods to reflect the most relevant demand level. sigma_hat left as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend can apply its usual safety-stock scaling. These choices balance service (by increasing lead-time allowance slightly) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume and mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=15, in-transit=86. Concluded lead-time observations: {P4: order P2 LT=2, P6: order P5 LT=1, P8: orders P6 LT=2 and P7 LT=1} \u2014 mixed 1\u20132 periods. Pipeline is large but arrivals have been inconsistent; use observed-average lead time to let backend smooth between 1 and 2. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20138) averages ~39 units/week with moderate variability; older Jan samples are lower, so prefer a recent-window forecast. Choices: L via "calculate" (backend averages concluded lead times so we reflect actual observed mix); mu_hat via "recent_N" with N=8 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 8 demand observations; sigma_hat via "recent_N" with N=8 to capture recent volatility. These settings keep service-level driven base-stock anchored to the most recent demand regime while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time behavior and cap exposure to excessive ordering given current large in-transit.

Recent concluded history shows intermittent arrivals with observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2 at Period 5. No sustained demand regime shift detected relative to provided historical samples (Jan\u2013Feb weekly mean ~35). To remain consistent with the promised lead time and the historical demand base, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use full sample mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 Period 11. Recent weekly demand has been ~25\u201345 units (multiple stockouts historically). On-hand=12 + in-transit=94 => pipeline=106 which currently covers several weeks of demand. Observed concluded lead-times show variability but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2; no sustained change (only occasional early/late arrivals). I therefore keep L at the promised/default to let the OR engine use promised lead time, and use default demand and volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (avoiding stockouts seen recently) against holding cost given significant pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=116 (large pipeline). Historical demand in game periods (P6-P11) averages ~35.8 units/week with moderate variability. Promised lead time=2 and past concludes show mixed 1\u20132 but no sustained shift; keep L=default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime (last 6 periods P6\u2013P11) so the base-stock covers (1+L) review+lead demand based on recent data. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong pipeline and recent demand ~36/wk) against holding cost by relying on recent mean/variance rather than old low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1) suggesting average lead time ~1.5 but no sustained shift away from promised 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=119 \u2014 pipeline is large but some past orders arrived with 1-2 period delays and none are confirmed lost. Use calculated average lead time to let backend balance observed variability. Demand history (seed samples mean=35.2) shows no confirmed regime change; keep default demand/volatility estimation so OR engine uses all samples adjusted by (1+L). This approach preserves service while avoiding over-reacting to mixed 1/2 period arrivals and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/05/13. On-hand=7, in-transit=103 (pipeline total 110) which roughly covers (1+L) periods of demand given historical weekly mean ~35. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period realizations but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2 at Period 5; no sustained lead-time shift detected. Use default L (promised=2) so backend computes base-stock using all historical samples. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples; this leverages full sample set and lets the OR engine cap orders given the large in-transit volume, avoiding over-ordering while maintaining service level.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent visible on-hand=0, in-transit=112. Historical sample mean (provided) = 35.2 units/week; with promised L=2, (L+1)=3 -> expected demand \u2248105.6 units over review+lead. Pipeline (112) slightly exceeds that, so no explicit upward adjustment to demand or lead time is warranted. There is confirmed evidence from prior conclude messages that actual lead time has been 2 periods, so using the promised/default lead time keeps the OR engine aligned. I select default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (coverage \u2248105.6) against holding cost given modest pipeline surplus.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent realized demand has moderated vs. earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands = [29,30,15,13,31] (avg ~23.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=120 so pipeline is substantial but arrival timing has varied historically. Use calculated L to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (last 5 demand observations). This balances service (capturing recent lower demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=120. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (carry-over). Recent arrivals show some variability but not a sustained regime shift in demand. I select default lead time to use the promised/confirmed 2-period setting and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding overfitting to noisy short-term arrival variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=112. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods but promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed a 2-period delivery (Period 5). No sustained change in demand level since samples are limited to early 2019 weekly data; pipeline (112) is large relative to recent weekly demand (historical mean ~34). To let the OR backend use its standard demand estimate and promised lead time while avoiding over-adjustment for intermittent 1-period arrivals, I keep L as default (promised=2) and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR compute the base-stock from full-sample stats while the large in-transit pipeline will naturally limit orders.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=115 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (mostly 2, occasional 1); no sustained change in lead time. Recent demand has been intermittent with many stockouts. Because there is no new, sustained regime shift and pipeline is sizable, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the historical mean/variance across all samples while capping orders by the computed cap. This avoids overreacting to volatile short-term arrivals while letting the backend temper order quantities given the large in-transit volume.

Demand history (sample mean=35.2 units/week from provided samples) shows no sustained new regime (recent spike to 88 is single period). To protect service with promised lead time and avoid overreacting to one-off spike, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Historical weekly mean (~35.2) from provided samples implies (1+L)=3 periods demand \u2248105, so pipeline (126) is sufficient to cover near-term demand. Observed concluded lead times have been 1\u20132 but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2; use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This balances service-level (cover ~3 weeks) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=128 (pipeline substantial). Recent demand has increased and become more volatile (last 5 demands: 8, 23, 88, 50, 127) so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime while keeping promised lead time. Set L=default (use promised 2). Set mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples and capture elevated mean. Set sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect increased recent volatility. This balances service (higher forecast) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent concluded history shows intermittent arrivals but overall demand is high and variable (historical samples mean\u224835.2/wk). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=235 \u2014 large pipeline already covering multiple weeks so no aggressive up-weighting of demand needed. Promised lead time is 2; recent evidence (mixed 1\u20132) but no sustained change beyond earlier confirmation. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine caps ordering given existing large in-transit; this balances service vs holding cost given high pipeline and modest per-unit profit/holding costs.

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (13 observed arrivals, avg \u22481.62), so I use the calculated average lead time to capture this variability. Demand samples (weekly historical data provided) show no clear sustained regime shift requiring a recent_N or EWMA adjustment, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for the inferred average lead time. This balances service level (by increasing L slightly above 1) versus holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

To keep policy aligned with promised lead time and the confirmed observation, I use the promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (uses confirmed L=2) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=170. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period 19 (demands: 88,50,127,113,38,93,68) \u2014 regime length 7. Past concluded messages confirm typical lead time ~2 (carry-over). To protect service during this higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher average and variance. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2), since concluded evidence supports 2 and no new sustained lead-time change is observed. This raises the backend base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weeks show a clear high-demand summer regime (multiple demands >80 including 127,113,110,93,68) so I bias forecasts to recent history. On-hand=0, in-transit=295 (pipeline substantial). Promised lead time remains appropriate given past confirmed 2-period observations; use default promised L to align with OR engine. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained demand increase and higher volatility so the backend raises base-stock and safety stock accordingly while the cap limits excessive single-period orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows large, volatile weekly demand with several high spikes (weeks with 68,110,118,127). On-hand=0, in-transit=237 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely to cover multiple upcoming weeks. Previous concluded messages confirm lead time ~2 periods; no sustained new lead-time evidence. I select default L to use the promised lead time (2). I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std using all historical samples; this keeps the model anchored to full-sample demand given high volatility and lets the capped ordering rule limit excessive orders despite large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): on-hand=0, in-transit=237. Prior concluded history confirmed lead time \u22482 (Period 5 insight). Recent arrivals are noisy but no sustained changepoint in demand or lead time; pipeline (237) is large relative to typical weekly demand samples. I choose default lead time (use promised 2) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean-based base stock, avoiding overfitting to recent noisy spikes while letting the large in-transit pipeline reduce new orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=237 \u2014 substantial pipeline arriving in future periods but not visible yet. Promised L=2 has been historically confirmed (Period 5 evidence) and observed lead times vary between 1\u20132; no sustained shift since. Demand context: base historical samples (Jan 2019) show mean ~35/week; profit/holding imply high service target (q=0.8). I choose default lead time to let backend use promised L=2, and default demand/volatility to rely on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to long-run statistics while the large in-transit quantity reduces ordering due to pipeline coverage, balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=237. Recent demand regime (Periods 26-30) is substantially higher than early-season samples (demands: 110,118,78,56,47), so I use recent data to set demand forecast. Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods (carry-over); use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the elevated demand and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock accordingly given high pipeline and to balance service vs holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=292. Recent demand shows a sustained higher summer regime: last 5 demand samples = [118,78,56,47,46], recent mean \u2248 69. To respond to the higher recent demand and preserve service while accounting for promised lead time=2, I use recent_N for demand and volatility (N=5). I keep L as default (promised lead time) because concluded history confirms lead time \u22482 and no new sustained lead-time shift is observed. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to reflect the elevated recent mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock versus holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been elevated and more stable (Periods 28-32: 78,56,47,46,46) after summer spikes; on-hand=9, in-transit=237 so pipeline is large. Promised lead time is 2 and past concluded messages show mixed 1-2 arrivals but no sustained change since previous confirmation, so keep default L. To reflect recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend targets safety and mean appropriate to current regime while relying on large pipeline to cover near-term demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30. On-hand=0, in-transit=237. Recent concluded lead-times vary 1\u20132 but Period 5 previously confirmed LT=2; no sustained change since. Recent demand (last 8 concluded periods) = [110,118,78,56,47,46,46,61], showing a lower post-peak regime but still elevated vs. early-year samples\u2014use a recent-N demand estimate to capture this regime. Keep L as promised (default) so OR backend uses promised lead time; use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to target the current demand regime; keep sigma_hat default so volatility uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (capture recent higher demand) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=256. Recent history shows variable demand with occasional large spikes; several past orders have exhibited both 1- and 2-period actual lead times but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2 at Period 5. Given remaining uncertainty in realized lead time and plentiful in-transit inventory, use calculated L (average of observed lead times) so the OR engine can adapt to observed lead-time pattern. Use default demand/volatility (all samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this balances service level versus holding cost when pipeline is already large. This keeps ordering conservative until lead-time and demand regime shifts are better confirmed.

Use default L so backend uses promised lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all provided samples) because the provided baseline sample set is limited and recent arrivals vary. This conservative choice hands forecasting to OR engine while avoiding overfitting to noisy/partial arrival history; it balances service level (via base-stock from sample mean) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Historical concluded lead-time evidence (recorded in carry-over) confirms LT=2; no new sustained lead-time change detected. Demand shows variability but no recent sustained regime shift that would justify overriding defaults. To keep OR backend aligned with promised LT and long-run demand statistics, use defaults so base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using long-run mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has risen sharply over the last 5 weeks (Periods 33-37: 61,72,88,126,128). On-hand=0, in-transit=256 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand (~>5 weeks covered) but we must account for review+lead demand (1+L). Prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 2 periods. To capture the recent sustained upward regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the higher recent mean and volatility rather than the long-ago low-Jan samples. This balances service (avoidable stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost; large in-transit reduces need for aggressive orders this period but parameters should reflect the new demand level so the backend's capped order won't overreact to older low-demand data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (large pipeline). Recent demand has stepped up sharply starting Period 35 (demands: 88,126,128,76). I keep L as default (promised 2) since prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2 and arrivals still consistent with 1\u20132 but no sustained change. To capture the recent uptick I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 35\u201338, N=4) so the OR backend targets stock for the higher recent demand and reflects increased volatility; this balances service (avoiding stockouts during the new high-demand regime) against holding cost given we already have a large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: avg demand = 104.5 over Periods 35\u201338 (88,126,128,76)

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history (Periods 35\u201338) shows a sustained higher-demand regime (avg \u2248104.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=353 \u2014 pipeline well above (1+L)*recent mean so stock should cover expected demand for lead+review. Use promised lead time (default) since confirmed historic evidence supports L=2 and no new contrary conclude messages. Set mu_hat using recent_N over the 4-period high-demand regime to capture the current mean ((1+L)*mean over Periods 35\u201338). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to the higher demand while the large in-transit position limits further aggressive ordering, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=353 units \u2014 large pipeline likely to cover upcoming demand. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime from Periods 35\u201338 (avg 104.5). Lead times historically centered on 2 (confirmed previously). I choose L=default (promised 2) to keep OR aligned with contract lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 35\u201338) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to capture volatility in this regime. These choices make the backend size base-stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit position prevents over-ordering; using recent samples raises service level appropriately given higher demand and limits holding cost by relying on existing pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 35 (avg ~104.5 over P35\u2013P38) but subsequent weeks (P39\u2013P41) returned to lower values; no new 3+ period sustained change observed. Observed lead times vary (1\u20132) but promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded arrivals are consistent with promised lead time (e.g., P39 order arrived in P41). To keep the OR backend stable given mixed LT signals and the existing in-transit stock (330 units), use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend applies its historical-sample-based base-stock and caps. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the large pipeline will cover upcoming demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Profit=4, holding=1 (service quantile q=0.8). Historical demand shows a confirmed regime shift at Period 35 (Periods 35\u201338 avg=104.5) but the most recent 4 periods (Periods 39\u201342 demands = 42,38,28,39) average ~36.75, indicating a lower recent demand regime. Lead-time observations remain mixed but previously confirmed as 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time shift. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (N chosen = 4 because the recent regime length is 4 periods). Given large in-transit (330) this conservative recent-based forecast prevents overreacting to the earlier spike while letting the OR backend compute base-stock and cap with current demand volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Promised L=2; pipeline (330) covers ~110 units/period over (1+L)=3 periods, which is aligned with the higher-demand regime observed in Oct (Periods 35\u201338 avg=104.5). No new sustained lead-time evidence since prior insights. I set L to default (use promised 2). For demand I focus on the confirmed higher regime (Periods 35\u201338) using recent_N N=4 so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean (captures the spike ~104.5) and sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in that regime. This balances service (meet the confirmed higher demand) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Historical concluded lead-time observations consistently show 2-period arrivals recently (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P39\u2192P41); I therefore keep promised/default lead time. Demand has declined since the Oct peak (Periods 35\u201338) \u2014 recent six concluded demands (Periods 39\u201344 = 42,38,28,39,12,10) average \u224828.2, indicating a new lower regime. I choose recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime over the review+lead horizon so the OR backend targets a smaller base stock and avoids excess holding cost while maintaining service. L uses default to align with promised lead time; mu_hat recent_N uses the last 6 demands to compute (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat recent_N uses last 6 demands to compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand regime (Periods 35\u201338) shows higher mean (~104.5) versus earlier history; carry-over in-transit=330 units, on-hand=0 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover multiple periods. Promised lead time=2 and historical concludes predominantly support L=2, so use default (promised) lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses avg of last 4 demand samples from the identified regime) so base stock reflects elevated demand over review+lead (1+L) periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given strong pipeline and holiday season) against holding cost (pipeline already large, so rely on recent stats rather than inflating forecasts further).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Historical concluded lead-times consistently show 2 periods (matches promised); no sustained lead-time shift observed, so use default promised L. Demand shows a clear regime change around Period 39 (recent weeks much lower than the spike in Periods 35\u201338); to capture the current lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 39\u201346, length=8). This keeps the base-stock sized to current demand while the large in-transit balance (330 units) limits new ordering risk and reduces holding costs.
