Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Review of evidence: on-hand=0 but in-transit=2862; recent conclude messages (Periods 44\u201346) show orders placed but arrived=0, continuing the documented pattern of unreliable/delayed shipments. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) and many lost/delayed shipments since Period 16, so I cannot trust the in-transit figure to be reliable or to arrive on the promised schedule. OR baseline recommends 0 units (uses promised L=2 and historical demand); given a very large pipeline (2862) and high uncertainty about arrivals, placing additional orders risks accumulating excess inventory if shipments do arrive, increasing holding cost for little expected incremental sales short-term. Profit per unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1), but we already have substantial pipeline that may fulfill demand when/if it arrives; the prudent action is to not order now and wait for conclusive arrivals in future 'conclude' messages to infer actual lead time and lost shipments before replenishing. Therefore I follow OR's recommendation and order 0 units for 160442010 this period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "OR recommends 0; with in-transit=2862 and continued evidence of delayed/lost shipments, I order 0 to avoid over-ordering while we wait for confirmed arrivals and clearer lead-time signals.",
