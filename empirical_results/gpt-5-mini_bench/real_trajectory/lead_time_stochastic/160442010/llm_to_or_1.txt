Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [84,54,56,70,72], mean\u224867.2, no in-transit or on-hand inventory, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Promised lead time (2) is used. Using default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) is appropriate given no evidence of regime change and low holding cost relative to profit (q high) so backend will target a service-oriented base stock without overreacting to noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=88 (ordered Period 1, not yet arrived in conclude \u2014 cannot conclude lead-time change). Historical weekly demand mean = 67.2 (5 samples). Promised lead time is 2 and no sustained evidence of a different lead time or demand regime yet. Use default lead time (promised L=2) so backend uses offered lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping decisions conservative until arrivals or multiple periods of evidence clarify lead time or demand shifts. This balances service level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost while we await arrival confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=178 (orders 88+90). Historical weekly demand samples mean=67.2. Promised lead time=2; concluded messages show no arrivals yet for Periods 1\u20132 but that's expected to be unresolved until Period 3 conclude\u2014insufficient evidence to change lead time or mark shipments lost. I choose default lead time (promise=2) and default demand moments so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that covers the review+lead horizon while avoiding premature regime shifts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan-Feb) mean \u224867.2; recent concluded messages show no arrivals yet but insufficient evidence to confirm lead-time change or lost shipments (only one expected arrival window missed for P1). Pipeline (349) already exceeds three-period expected demand (\u22483\xd767.2\u2248201.6), so do not inflate forecasts. Choose promised lead time to avoid overreacting to early delays and use default demand estimates based on full sample set so the OR engine applies its standard base-stock and cap calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4). On-hand=0, in-transit=440 (large pipeline). Historical weekly demand samples (given) have mean ~67.2. I will trust the promised/observed lead time (use default lead time=2) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this leverages all available demand history while the large in-transit stock reduces urgency to inflate forecasts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (ordered on Period2, arrived on Period4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=526. Historical sample demand (2019 Jan-Feb) mean=67.2 used as baseline; recent concluded history shows many lost/delayed arrivals but Period 4 confirms lead time=2. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine's base-stock calculation uses long-run sample mean (stabilizes orders given large in-transit pipeline). This balances service level (keep replenishment sized for L=2) vs. holding cost given already-high in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized demand has jumped sharply: Periods 4-6 demands = 132, 136, 243 (avg 170.3) vs historical sample mean 67.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=440 (large pipeline). Observed lead times: P2->P4 = 2, P5->P6 = 1 (inconsistent). I set L using recent_N (N=2) to capture the short-run average lead time (1.5) rather than default promised=2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new higher-demand regime (use the last 3 periods 132,136,243). These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher (1+L)-period demand while recognizing pipeline inventory; they bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given the demand spike, and sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to preserve service while holding cost is low relative to profit ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg historical samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) = 67.2; recent avg (Periods 4-6) = 170.3 (+153.6%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=691. Historical demand samples show a sustained upward regime: Periods 4-6 avg ~170.3 (confirmed earlier). Recent concluded lead times observed = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6)}. I select L by 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures variability between 1\u20132). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to anchor mu_hat to the new, higher regime (use last 3 demand samples rather than long-run mean). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while letting backend compute safety stock consistent with inferred shorter/variable lead time and current pipeline (691 units) to avoid overstocking.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=670. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times: observed Ls = {Period4:2, Period6:1, Period8:1} so recent average \u22481.33. Demand regime shifted up at Period 4 and has remained high (demands P4\u2013P8 = [132,136,243,302,343]); I treat the recent high-demand regime as the forecast basis. To reflect shorter realized lead times recently while retaining responsiveness to the elevated demand, I set L using recent observed lead times (N=3). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 4\u20138) to capture the new regime mean and volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent samples captures higher variability and limits stockouts; using recent lead-time average reduces over-ordering if lead times remain closer to 1\u20131.5 periods. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are applied because recent concludes show arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has shifted sharply higher vs historical (recent weeks 132,136,243,302,343). On-hand=0, in-transit=966 which likely covers several periods of elevated demand but arrivals observed have variable lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,1). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability between 1\u20132). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 5 concluded demand samples reflect the shift). Sigma also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while relying on pipeline visibility to avoid excess holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. On-hand 165 + in-transit 444 = 609 units. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = [2,1,1,2,1] \u2192 avg ~1.4), so use calculated average lead time. Demand shows a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 4; use recent_N to capture current higher mean/volatility. Selected L by "calculate" to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 (regime length from Period4\u2013Period10 = 7) so the OR backend targets service for the new higher-demand regime while capping orders via its cap rule to control holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime versus historical samples: P4\u2013P6 average demand ~170 (vs historical mean 67.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=841 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2); use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed higher-demand regime (periods 4\u20136). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated short-term demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits ordering aggressiveness.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=1242. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = [2,1,1,2,1] -> average ~1.4), so set L by calculate to reflect observed mean. Demand has clearly shifted upward and remained elevated since Period 4 (many recent demands >> historical sample mean); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime using the last 9 periods to estimate demand mean and volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet service while limiting excess holding given large in-transit stock.

To reflect observed lead-time variability I choose calculate (average observed lead time) so backend uses inferred L\u22481.5. Demand forecast should reflect the recent high-demand regime, so mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 (captures the 3-period high regime). Volatility also set to recent_N N=3 to reflect elevated recent variability. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind given large pipeline.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (recent weeks well above historical sample mean). To reflect confirmed faster/variable arrivals but let OR use observed average, set L to calculate (average observed). For demand forecast and volatility use recent data to capture the new high-demand regime: recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last 7 demand samples and reflect current mean/variance. This balances service (higher mean) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Historical concludes show mixed lead times (observed W = 2,1,1,2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.57); demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (sustained high demand). To capture the actual lead-time behavior use calculate (avg observed). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent data (recent_N) using the recent regime length (N=12) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*mean of recent periods and recent volatility, improving service while controlling holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. On-hand=0, In-transit=1077. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed values: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2) so average lead time is slightly <2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 and recent weeks (Periods 14\u201316 demands = 262,308,383) show an elevated mean. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent elevated demand trend (focus on last 3 periods). Sigma is set to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping variance and holding-cost tradeoffs responsive to the latest realized variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=108, in-transit=738 => strong pipeline (846 total) versus recent weekly demands (many 200-300s). Observed concluded lead times vary (sequence: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1) => average ~1.56, with multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals. To balance the backend's use of promised lead time and observed variability, set L to 'calculate' (use average observed lead time). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine uses the full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this leverages all available demand history while the calculated L captures the mixed lead-time behavior. This keeps service high given large pipeline while avoiding over-optimistic single-period forecasts in presence of lead-time variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=888. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times 1\u20132 but promised L=2; no new sustained lead-time evidence. Demand regime shift previously observed (Periods 4\u20136) to a higher mean; recent demand remains elevated. To respond to the sustained higher-demand regime while respecting promised lead time, I keep L as default (promised=2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the most recent high-demand regime without over-weighting older low-demand history). This biases the OR engine toward higher base stock to reduce lost sales while capping orders via the engine's cap to limit holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1-2 periods but promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2; use default promised LT to be conservative. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Period 4 and recent weeks remain elevated; use recent_N=6 to have forecast reflect the current high-demand regime while smoothing short noise. Use recent_N=6 for sigma to capture recent volatility. These settings bias the OR base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weeks show consistently high demand (~260\u2013383) versus historical sample mean 67.2; in-transit = 1030, on-hand = 0. Lead times observed vary between 1\u20132 periods; use an empirical average to let backend infer current realized lead time. Because a sustained demand regime shift was previously detected (Periods 4\u20136 onward) I use a recent-N forecast to capture elevated mean and volatility (N=5 captures the most recent behavior while remaining >=3). These parameters aim to raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while sigma uses recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses contract L=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to bias the forecast to the recent high-demand weeks and keep safety stock responsive; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture elevated demand) versus holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Demand history shows a prior sustained upward regime (not changed recently). Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, respecting the promised-review horizon and existing in-transit units.

Historical conclude messages show actual lead times averaging ~2 (recent arrivals from P20->P22 and P21->P23 had lead_time=2); promised lead time is 2. Demand has been in the higher regime established earlier (carry-over): recent demand is much higher than the 2019-Jan baseline. To keep service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19, use the promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Use matching recent-N volatility for sigma to reflect current variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=974 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and recent concluded lead-times vary but no new sustained shift; keep L as default. Recent demand (Periods 20-24 = 280,198,209,188,109) indicates a higher recent mean than early historical samples; to reflect current regime I set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture current variability. This avoids overreacting to older low-volume samples while accounting for the substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=974 \u2014 large pipeline covers multiple periods so risk of stockout is low despite zero on-hand. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior evidence; no sustained further lead-time change observed. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime earlier (detected around Periods 4-6, regime length=3), so I bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime rather than the long-run historical mean. Therefore: use promised lead time (default) since concluded messages support L=2; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent high-demand regime; use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with current higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction because a large in-transit position already exists.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=963 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with a recent 3-period arrival (order on P23 arrived on P26 => LT=3) plus earlier 2-period observations; I therefore set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the short-term average LT. Demand has clearly shifted upward from the historical 67.2 baseline; I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5, using Periods 22-26 demands: 209,188,109,121,131) so mu_hat reflects the last 5 weeks' demand pattern multiplied by (1+L). Volatility will use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since variability is high historically and pipeline is large\u2014this lets the OR backend size safety stock while capping orders. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts given uncertain LT) versus holding cost (large in-transit reduces need for aggressive additional ordering).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=963 (large pipeline but many past delays). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent arrivals show slight increase (last 5 observed lead times avg \u22481.8). Recent demand has fallen from earlier spike; last 5-period demand avg = ~128.8, so I use recent data to capture current demand regime and recent lead-time behavior. Chosen: L by recent_N to reflect recent observed lead times (protect against occasional 3-period delays); mu_hat recent_N to reflect current realized demand (reducing from earlier peak); sigma_hat recent_N to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting the near-term realized demand while accounting for pipeline and occasional longer delays.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=963. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average recent observed lead time ~1.7. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P24\u2013P28) = [109,121,131,95,80], mean=107.2 \u2014 demand has cooled from the earlier spike. To reflect actual observed lead-time variability use an empirical average (calculate). To make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the recent lower demand regime, use recent_N=5 (covers the most recent 5 weeks). These parameters let the OR backend set a base-stock that reacts to the current (lower) demand while the calculated lead time incorporates observed faster-than-promised arrivals and occasional delays, helping balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=963. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1-3 but previously confirmed as 2; promised lead time is 2. Recent demand (last several weeks) has been moderate (~80-130) after earlier high spike in Mar; to reflect recent lower regime while still covering review+lead demand, I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=5 to capture the most recent pattern. L uses default (promised=2) to align OR engine expectations with contract. This balances service (use recent demand to avoid over-ordering given large pipeline) vs holding cost by not inflating mu_hat from old high spikes.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior periods and promised lead time remains appropriate. Recent realized demand (Periods 24-30) averages lower (~96\u2013109 range) than the earlier high-regime spike; therefore I anchor forecast on the most recent 7 weeks to capture current demand level while (1+L) scaling and keep volatility estimated from the same recent window.

No new sustained lead-time evidence since prior insights, so keep L at promised (default) to let backend assume 2. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P27-P31 = 95,80,88,96,79) is lower than the early spike; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding given high in-transit.

Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 28-32) ~ 83 avg, showing no new sustained shift vs historical baseline. Previous carry-over noted a past demand spike and confirmed LT=2; since we have no 3+ period consistent new signal and many in-transit units, use defaults to let backend use promised LT and long-run demand stats. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while covering demand with current pipeline.

Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=963 \u2014 a large pipeline from prior orders. Recent demand shows variability with a spike in Period 33 (183). Promised lead time = 2 and historical actual lead times have varied, but no new sustained lead-time shift since prior confirmation. To keep the OR engine responsive to the most recent demand regime while respecting promised lead time, I select L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the last 5 weeks' demand (Periods 29-33) which reflect current regime including the recent spike. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so the backend sizes safety stock to recent variability. This leverages the large in-transit volume (reducing immediate ordering urgency) while ensuring forecasts reflect recent demand increases.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=963 (large pipeline). Historical long-run mean = 67.2 and earlier carry-over noted a temporary spike (Periods 4-6). Recent realized weekly demand (last 5 periods) is lower/variable, so I use the promised lead time and downweight the old spike by forecasting from the most recent 5 samples. L left as default (promised 2) so OR backend assumes standard lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect current short-run demand; sigma_hat stays default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps orders conservative given the large in-transit volume and avoids overstock while maintaining service level.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=0, in-transit=963. Historical demand shows a past spike (Periods 4-6) but recent realized demand (Periods 32-36) averages ~80 units/week, indicating demand returned to lower regime. Lead-time has been confirmed previously as 2. To reflect current lower recent demand and reduce holding cost given large in-transit, set L to default (promised 2), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock vs using the earlier spike and lets the existing in-transit (963) cover upcoming demand without overordering.

Pipeline is large so use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and lower current volatility, balancing service vs holding given high in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=963. Historical concludes show lead time confirmed at 2 and an earlier demand regime shift; recent weeks (Periods 33-38) exhibit lower/variable demand (183,50,43,51,53,62) \u2014 recent pattern appears lower than the earlier spike. I keep L at default (promised 2) because confirmed evidence supports 2 and no new sustained lead-time change. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast on the latest six periods' demand (captures recent lower demand pattern) so orders won't overshoot given large in-transit. sigma_hat left at default to let backend use full-sample volatility adjusted for (1+L). This balances service level with holding cost given high in-transit inventory and lower recent demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=963 \u2014 large pipeline but many past shipments did not conclude recently; no new concluded arrivals that change inferred lead time. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (2) because carry-over evidence previously confirmed lead time=2 and no sustained contrary pattern observed. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this targets demand over the review+lead window and balances service vs holding given profit $19 and holding $1). This conservatively avoids overreacting to recent noisy/no-arrival periods while the large in-transit pipeline will limit new ordering.

Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=963. Recent concluded history shows intermittent arrivals and earlier confirmed lead time=2; no new sustained change to demand or lead time since last insights. There are large pipeline units (963) so do not alter lead-time or demand priors; use defaults so OR backend applies promised L and the full-sample demand stats. This keeps orders conservative given high in-transit inventory and avoids over-ordering while backend balances service vs holding cost.

Historical conclude messages confirm a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 4-6) to a higher mean; no new lead-time evidence beyond promised L=2. To keep service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent regime (small recent window) so the OR engine will size orders to the higher short-term demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=963 which provides substantial coverage versus recent weekly demand (historical mean ~67). Past concluded messages confirm lead time = 2 in earlier periods and demand regime shifts were already recorded; no new 3+ period demand or lead-time pattern emerges in the conclude history. I therefore use default lead time (promised = 2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples. This leverages the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering while letting the backend compute safety stock given long historical sample set.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=963. Historical concluded lead times support promised L=2 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 43,56,44,140,24) averages ~61.4, near long-run mean; no new sustained regime change. Use promised lead time to align with supplier contract and because concluded history matches it. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent weeks' demand while scaling by (1+L) in backend. Use default sigma_hat (all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to give the OR engine a conservative safety buffer. This combination keeps orders responsive to recent demand while avoiding overreacting to single large week (140) given large in-transit stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Historical small-sample season mean = 67.2 with an earlier sustained spike around Periods 4-6, but recent concluded demands (Periods 42-44) are 140, 24, 19 \u2014 overall uncertain downward trend. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 963 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times average \u22481.67 periods (mixed 1\u20133). To avoid further ordering given a large in-transit position, I let backend use the calculated average lead time and global demand moments: L set to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std use all historical samples. This biases the policy to respect the pipeline inventory and prevents aggressive new orders while allowing the OR engine to compute safety stock from full-sample statistics.

Historical early-2019 samples show a past high-demand regime, but recent Dec weeks (Periods 42-46) show much lower demand (~24,19,26,25,25). I preserve promised lead time and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the current low-demand December regime so the base-stock won't overshoot given the large in-transit volume. This balances service vs. holding cost with conservative replenishment.
