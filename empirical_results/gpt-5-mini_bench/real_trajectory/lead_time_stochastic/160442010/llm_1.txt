Demand regime analysis: Recent observed demands: Period1=81, Period2=199.

If all in-transit arrive, 411 units would cover ~2.9 periods at a ~140 units/period recent average ((81+199)/2) or ~5+ periods vs. historical Jan mean (~67).

Recent demand (P42\u2013P46) excluding one outlier (P42=140) averages ~24/week (P43\u2013P46 mean=23.5). With promised lead_time=2 and observed variable actual LT historically (1\u20133, occasional lost shipments), we must cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand. Required cover \u22483*25\u224875 units. Current on-hand=0 but in-transit=773 units \u2014 ample to cover demand for many weeks. Some past shipments were delayed/lost, but the large in-transit balance and multiple concluded arrivals in prior periods imply substantial pipeline is valid. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit, so avoid over-ordering. Therefore place no new order this period.",
