Demand view: a sustained regime shift started Period 17 with recent weekly demands ~85 (Periods 17\u201321 mean \u224884.8 and subsequent weeks mostly 57\u2013112). Requirement: with promised L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand immediately after ordering. Target pipeline \u2248 3 \xd7 85 \u2248 255. Risk/finance: profit=$1 and holding=$1 \u21d2 critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock beyond expected demand. OR recommended 0; its cap/estimates use older historical mean and promised L. Given in-transit exactly matches the 3-period demand estimate (255) and recent lead times are typically 1\u20132 (so arrivals likely to materialize), placing additional order would only raise holding cost equal to profit and is not justified. Final decision: place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost while pipeline meets the 3-period demand estimate.",
