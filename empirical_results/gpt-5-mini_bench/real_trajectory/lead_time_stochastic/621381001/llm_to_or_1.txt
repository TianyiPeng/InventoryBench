Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks: 25,26,20,32,48) show a recent uptick but only one high week\u2014insufficient evidence for a sustained regime change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service level (captures recent variability) against holding cost given limited data and zero inventory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand spike: Period 1 demand=48 (historical weekly samples: 25,26,20,32,48; mean=30.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=49 (order placed Period 1 not yet arrived in Period 1 conclude). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; shipment may still be in transit per promised lead time=2. Use default promised lead time to avoid overcorrecting for missing conclude data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale historical mean/variance by (1+L)) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using full-sample stats rather than a small recent window that could overreact to one high week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=103 (orders P1=49 + P2=54). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; promised lead time (2) used. Historical weekly demand samples: [25,26,20,32,48] => mean ~30.2. No sustained regime change (single high week not enough). To balance service level vs holding cost use default calculations so OR backend will set base stock = (1+L)*mean + safety based on profit/(profit+holding). This avoids overreacting to a one-off spike while respecting current pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly demand mean = 30.2 (samples: 25,26,20,32,48). Three previous orders (P1=49,P2=54,P3=34) remain in-transit (total 137) and P1 (ordered Period 1) failed to arrive by its promised arrival (would have concluded in Period 3) \u2014 indicating actual lead time is longer than the promised 2 or a lost shipment risk. To avoid stockouts while accounting for potential extended lead time, I set L explicitly to 3 (one period longer than promised). Using mu_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean across all samples, preserving historical demand signal scaled for review+lead. sigma_hat default lets the backend scale observed volatility by sqrt(1+L). This increases recommended pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time while keeping demand estimates tied to historical data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand (Periods 1-4 conclude) is materially higher than the historical Jan samples: recent demands = [48,65,48,43], recent mean = 51 vs historical mean = 30.2. On-hand=11, in-transit=129 (pipeline large). Observed arrival in Period 4 shows actual lead time = 2 (matches promised). To capture the sustained higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; keep L as default (promised) since observed lead time matches promise. This raises target base-stock to meet the new demand level while sigma from recent data shapes safety stock to balance service vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean=30.2 (Jan samples) -> recent mean=51 (Periods Feb11\u2013Mar04), +69%, sustained over 4 periods

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=157. Historical demand samples show a sustained regime shift identified in Period 5 (recent mean ~51 over Feb11\u2013Mar04, up ~69%). Observed concluded lead time = 2 (Period4 arrival: ordered P2 arrived after 2 periods), so use calculated lead time based on observed data. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime length = 4 periods Feb11\u2013Mar04). This increases forecasted (1+L)-period demand and uncertainty so the OR backend raises base stock to avoid stockouts while still using its capped order size to limit exposure given holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand elevated vs Jan baseline: last three demands (Periods 4\u20136) = 43,36,42 indicating a higher regime than historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=135 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) => variable lead time; use recent average. Set L via recent_N on last 2 observed lead times to capture current shorter trend. For demand forecast use recent_N over last 3 demand observations (Periods 4\u20136) to target (1+L)-period demand in the new regime; same recent_N for sigma to reflect updated volatility. This balances higher service level from elevated demand while the large in-transit stock limits aggressive ordering to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has been elevated (recent weeks: 43,36,42,62) after a regime shift noted earlier. Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows LT=2 (order P2\u2192P4), P6 shows LT=1 (order P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed but recent evidence is short. On-hand=0, in-transit=135 (sufficient near-term pipeline). To be responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while reflecting recent variability in arrivals, I set L to recent_N (N=2) to average the two observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (last 4 demand samples) so the OR backend targets the elevated short-run demand and appropriate safety stock. This balances higher service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=148. Recent concluded arrivals reveal observed lead times [2 (P4),1 (P6),2 (P8)] => short-term avg ~1.67; some shipments arrived later than promised but not consistently lost. Demand shows a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (higher mean); recent demand (Periods 5-8 = 36,42,62,44) better represents current demand. To balance service vs holding cost: use recent average lead time (recent_N) to reflect slightly shorter-than-promised realized lead time, and use recent_N for demand mean/volatility over the 4-period elevated regime so orders match current higher demand and avoid stockouts given sizable in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Recent concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) =2, P6 (order P5)=1, P8 (order P6)=2 \u2192 recent avg \u22481.67 so I use recent_N for L to capture this short but variable lead time. Demand has shifted up since Period 5 (sustained higher demand); I use recent_N over the last 5 demand periods (Periods 5\u20139: demands 36,42,62,44,53) to capture the current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices ensure the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing higher service level for elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand remains elevated (last 5 demands P6\u2013P10 = 42,62,44,53,41; mean=48.4) versus older history. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:2, P10(from P8):2, P10(from P9):1} => average \u22481.6. To capture variable but slightly below-promised lead time, set L method=calculate (use average observed). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher recent mean/volatility and limit influence of older low-demand samples; this tightens stocking to meet current elevated demand while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-29: recent demand has increased vs. historical Jan baseline (carry-over noted). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 159 (pipeline substantial but arrivals uncertain historically). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,2,1] \u2192 average ~1.6 so use calculated average lead time. Demand regime changepoint at Period 5 (sustained higher demand); use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus forecast on the most recent regime. I choose N=7 (regime length from Period5\u2192Period11 = 7), so backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the last 7 samples. These settings bias orders toward higher recent demand while keeping volatility measured from the same window, balancing service level vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=159. Observed arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2); average observed lead time = 1.6 so use calculated average to reflect realized lead-time variability. Demand shifted up at Period 5 and has remained higher; use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=8 (Periods 5\u201312) to capture the new regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices help the OR engine size base stock to cover the sustained higher demand while reflecting actual lead-time experience and current pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/05/13. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained higher mean). Current on-hand=4, in-transit=132 (sizable pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1\u20132); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent data to capture the sustained higher regime: choose recent_N with N=9 (regime from Period 5\u219213 has 9 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 9 demands. Volatility also estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=9). These choices raise target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the higher demand regime while using recent volatility to control safety stock and holding costs.

Demand recent behavior elevated vs Jan; using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime (last 6 demands: P9\u2013P14 = 53,41,43,44,23,36; mean\u224840) so backend will scale by (1+L).

Date 2019/5/27. Observed concluded lead times: P4(order P2)=2, P6(order P5)=1, P8(order P6)=2, P10(order P8)=2 & (order P9)=1, P13(order P11)=2 \u2192 avg \u22481.67 so use calculate (average observed). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods P11\u2013P15): [43,44,23,36,39], mean \u224837 -> use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to reflect current lower regime vs earlier Feb/March spike. Volatility also set to recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat. On-hand=0 + in-transit=141 covers multiple (1+L) periods at this demand level, so parameters lean to service (profit $4 vs holding $1 favors higher fill rate) while using recent data to avoid overstock from the Feb\u2013Mar spike.

Demand has shifted up vs the Jan baseline (previous carry-over noted +69% sustained). Use recent 5-week demand to capture the new higher regime and recent volatility. These settings help the OR engine size base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while reflecting shorter/variable actual lead time and limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,1,2} \u2192 avg \u22481.67, so set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history. Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent high-demand regime (last 4 demand samples: 36,39,46,69) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for recent demand) against holding cost while accounting for actual lead-time evidence and the large in-transit pipeline.

Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {2,1,2,2,1,2} (avg \u22481.67) so I use a recent-average lead time to capture this mix of 1\u20132 period realizations. Demand has been elevated vs. historical (carry-over noted a sustained +69% shift around Period 5); recent realized demand sequence (Periods 13\u201318) shows high and variable demand, so I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to reflect the current higher regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock (improving service given in-transit uncertainty and mixed lead times) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Demand has been elevated since Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand in May\u2013Jun). To balance service and holding cost: infer lead time from observed history (calculate) so backend uses average LT\u22481.57; use a recent demand estimate to capture the sustained higher regime (recent_N, N=7) for mu_hat and recent volatility for sigma_hat (recent_N, N=7) so orders reflect the latest high demand while limiting overstocks given holding cost. In-transit 142 already provides coverage; using recent estimates prevents over-ordering against stale low-demand history.

Recent demand has been elevated (last 5 periods demands: 39,46,69,66,73) indicating a higher current regime; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 samples. This increases forecasted base-stock to cover the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility. Using the observed lead-time average helps account for shipments arriving faster/slower than promised and avoids underordering given large in-transit position.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average of observed lead times \u22481.57 so use calculated average to let backend adapt. Demand forecast uses most recent regime (high-demand weeks). I select recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest high-demand regime (last 5 demand samples), ensuring base_stock covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand while avoiding overstating long-run variability given large in-transit volume. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-07-15: recent demand has risen and is volatile (last 5\u201310 weeks averages >> historical Jan mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=180 \u2014 sizable pipeline but past arrivals show actual lead times oscillating between 1\u20132 periods. I estimate lead time from recent observed lead-times (capture variability and recent trend). For demand I use the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the elevated regime (short window to adapt to sustained higher demand). Volatility uses the same recent window. These settings bias the OR base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given elevated demand and uncertain/shortening lead times, while sigma based on recent variability prevents extreme overstock given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=170. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.7); pipeline is large so use inferred average. Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has a sustained upward shift already recorded in history; no new changepoint detected now. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, relying on its statistical estimate given the in-transit cushion. This balances service (capture observed higher lead time) vs holding cost by not over-specifying an explicit higher forecast.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been elevated vs early-year baseline (sustained higher means since Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=170 \u2014 pipeline material exists but arrivals are observed with mixed 1\u20132 period actual lead times; no clear persistent >2 lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (~1.6) to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the recent high-demand regime (capture last 10 demand samples) so the base-stock target increases service level while sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances higher stock to meet elevated demand vs holding cost given existing in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=187. Recent concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (~1.6) rather than blindly trusting promised=2. Demand has shifted up and remained high since mid-June/July (many weeks with demand 53\u201377); I therefore use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime using the last 8 samples. This keeps orders responsive to the higher demand while letting the backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff (profit=4, holding=1).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), with a recent 3-period arrival at Period 26; last five observed lead-times average \u22481.8, so I use a recent_N estimate to capture this drift. Demand shows a sustained regime shift upward starting Period 5 (already recorded), so I use a recent_N demand estimate over the most recent regime (capped at 20) to reflect current higher demand and reduce stockouts. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (higher \u03bc\u0302 for higher demand and slightly longer recent lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=161. Recent demand has risen and become volatile (Periods 23\u201327 demands = 53,27,54,83,96; recent mean ~62.6). Lead times show variability (observed lead_times include 1,2 and a 3-period arrival at Period 26) so I use a short recent average to capture current delivery pace without over-committing to the promised 2. Set L by recent_N (N=3) to reflect the last few observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime. These settings raise target stock to meet much higher recent demand while sigma_hat accounts for elevated variability, helping the OR backend trade off service level (profit per unit $4) against holding cost ($1).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent demand has risen materially (recent weeks: 54,83,96,103). On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (healthy pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1\u20133); average observed \u22481.75. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead-time data. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (last 4 periods). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward service (profit:holding = 4:1 \u2192 high fill priority) while respecting increased demand and variable lead times; existing large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=284 (large pipeline but arrivals observed with varying delays). Observed concluded lead times average ~1.75 periods (mix of 1\u20133); use calculate so backend estimates average from observed lead times. Recent demand has stepped up: last 6 periods demands = [27,54,83,96,103,97], mean \u2248 76.7 \u2192 use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to meet elevated demand while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Observed concluded lead times (recent history) average \u22481.85 and show intermittent 3-period delays but no sustained shift; use calculated average for L so backend uses empirical lead-time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained +69%); recent demands remain elevated (many weeks with 80\u2013103 units). I select mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent regime while smoothing older low-demand data. This balances higher service level (to capture elevated demand) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to recent high-demand samples rather than all historical low-demand weeks.

Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with recent observations averaging \u22482, so use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand has risen and been sustained in recent months; to capture the current high-demand regime I use a recent-window demand estimate based on the last 13 observed demand samples (captures the recent summer peak and volatility). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=13 so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock appropriate to elevated demand while sigma accounts for recent variability. This balances service (avoid lost sales given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Profit/holding => target service quantile high (q=0.8). Observed concluded lead times vary (many 1\u20133); average of all observed lead times \u22481.8 so use calculated average to let backend adapt to realized variability. Recent demand has risen and remained high since Period 26 (weekly demands: 83,96,103,97,94,67,63) \u2014 detect a new high-demand regime of length 7; use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecast and safety stock reflect the elevated mean and volatility. This balances higher service level (capture profit) against holding cost by increasing base-stock proportional to recent elevated demand while letting backend cap orders via its cap formula and promised lead time assumption.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=282. Recent demand has been in a high regime since late Jul/Aug (periods 26\u201333); last 8 demands = [83,96,103,97,94,67,63,110], mean=89.1/day. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of all observed lead times = 1.8. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures variable actual LT). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (captures the sustained high-demand regime since late Jul). Sigma also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. With (1+L)\xd7recent mean the in-transit 282 covers ~3.2 periods of demand, so no immediate urgent replenishment needed; these parameters bias the OR backend towards stocking for the higher recent demand while respecting observed lead-time variability.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=292. Recent demand has risen sharply in late summer (Periods 28\u201334), so I use recent demand to set mu/sigma while letting lead-time be estimated from observed arrivals. Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 periods (average \u22481.8), so I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average. For demand I choose recent_N with N=5 (Periods 30\u201334: 94,67,63,110,103) to capture the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the current high demand while L='calculate' captures the slightly-below-2 realized lead time; given pipeline=292 vs recent (1+L)*mean \u2248 2.8*87.4\u2248245, we expect in-transit stock to cover near-term demand and avoid unnecessary ordering while maintaining service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: avg demand P28\u2013P34 = 91.0 (periods: 103,97,94,67,63,110,103) vs historical mean ~30.2 (Jan samples) \u2192 +201%, sustained over 7 periods

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand regime is high: Periods 28\u201334 avg \u224891 (samples: 103,97,94,67,63,110,103) \u2014 a sustained +200% shift versus earlier Jan mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=265 which covers multiple periods of elevated demand but some past orders showed variable lead times (observed lead times: 1\u20133 periods). To capture the confirmed longer/higher-variance demand regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend average recent observed variability) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 high-demand samples (regime length=7). This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat recentization raises safety stock to reflect observed volatility; using backend-calculated L aligns policy with the observed mixed lead times and preserves cap constraints.

On-hand=0, in-transit=233 (covers some upcoming demand but lead times have trended to 3 periods recently).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 28 (weekly demands ~103,97,94,67,63,110,103,90), so forecast should use recent high-demand samples. Concluded arrivals show multiple consistent 3-period lead times in recent history (evidence below), so set L based on recent observed lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=272 \u2014 with L\u22483 this pipeline covers ~4 review+lead weeks; still order policy must target (1+L)-period demand using recent mean to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 implies service quantile q=4/(4+1)=0.8). Chosen methods: infer L from recent observed lead times to capture the apparent shift to 3 periods; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat over the recent high-demand regime to reflect the higher mean/volatility and keep service levels appropriate. This balances service (avoid lost sales in high-demand regime) against holding costs given substantial in-transit stock and elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P26 order from P23 arrived P26; P30 order from P27 arrived P30; P35 order from P32 arrived P35; P36 order from P33 arrived P36).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 28 (demands: 103,97,94,67,63,110,103) and confirmed longer lead times historically (carry-over indicated LT=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=239 (pipeline present but arrivals observed with 3-period actual lead). To protect service during this high-demand regime I set L explicit=3 (reflecting observed arrivals at LT=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 28\u201334). I apply recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and cap using the recent high-demand mean and volatility; this balances selling high-margin units ($4) against $1 holding cost while accounting for the confirmed longer lead time and avoiding stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 28 (avg \u224891 over P28\u2013P34, sustained); on-hand=0, in-transit=325 units. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries and avoid treating large in-transit as arriving sooner. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the recent high-demand regime (regime length=7). This biases the base-stock toward higher service given profit/hold ratio (q=0.8) while using recent volatility to cap order sizes and limit excess holding given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmations P26/P30/P35/P36). Demand regime since P28 is elevated (avg \u224891 over P28\u2013P34, 7 periods). To cover review+lead and preserve service during this high-demand regime I set L explicit=3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the 7-period high-demand regime. This favors service (higher base stock) while in-transit inventory (338) helps cap immediate orders and limit excess holding.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime around Periods 28\u201334 (avg ~91 over 7 periods) though subsequent weeks are variable. On-hand=83, in-transit=230 \u2192 pipeline=313 which covers multiple review+lead periods (L+1). Given multiple concluded arrivals showing longer transit (confirmed previously as 3), I set lead time explicitly to 3. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime length=7). This biases the base-stock toward servicing the elevated demand while the large pipeline mitigates immediate stockout risk and limits extra ordering.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=16, in-transit=230. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed P26/P30/P35/P36). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 28 (avg \u224891 over P28\u2013P34) \u2014 I therefore forecast using recent demand samples to capture the elevated level. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the latest regime (~P30\u2013P43 window), balancing higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=8, in-transit=291 (large pipeline). Historical history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals at LT=3). Recent demand has moderated from the prior peak; last 7 demands (Periods 37\u201343) avg \u224846.6. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current post-peak regime; mu_hat uses the (1+L)-period aggregate of these recent weeks so the OR engine will size base stock for 4 periods of near-term demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=7) to reflect observed recent volatility. Given large in-transit inventory, this conservative recent-based forecast avoids overreacting to older extreme peaks while matching confirmed longer lead time.

On-hand=0 but in-transit=291 (sizable pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the high-demand regime from P28\u2013P44) so the OR backend targets a base stock sized to the current elevated demand and observed volatility; this avoids understocking from using old low-demand history while acknowledging substantial pipeline inventory to limit excess ordering.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=55, in-transit=239 \u2014 ample pipeline but some arrivals have shown actual lead_time=3 repeatedly. To reflect sustained higher demand and observed lead-time, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the entire high-demand regime (P28\u2013P45, regime_length=18).

Given large pipeline and no clear new demand regime since mid-Dec softness, use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean over history; volatility likewise default. This keeps target base-stock responsive to observed longer lead time while relying on backend historical demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.
