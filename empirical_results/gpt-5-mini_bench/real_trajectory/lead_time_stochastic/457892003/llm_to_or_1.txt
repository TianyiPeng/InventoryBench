Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly data to 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. Historical samples available (5 weekly points: 66,73,111,83,85) but no sustained changepoint or delayed shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std without overfitting to short history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=112 (order placed in Period 1). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Recent observed weekly demands (historical samples) show mean ~83.6; no sustained changepoint or seasonal signal detected. Use default lead time (promised=2) so OR backend assumes promised L; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (covers L+1 periods) without overreacting to limited data or potentially delayed shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u224883.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=222 (matches orders placed P1+P2). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1/P2 may still arrive on schedule); no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this balances service vs. holding cost given no confirmed regime shift and limited data. Note: current in-transit (222) is slightly below (1+L)\xd7historical mean, so backend will likely order to top up.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=233. Historical conclude messages for Periods 1\u20133 show no arrivals for prior orders (3 consecutive periods), indicating shipments are delayed or lost and actual lead time is likely longer than the promised 2. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline. Demand history (5 samples, mean=83.6) will be used by default formulas so mu_hat and sigma_hat use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to reflect the chosen L without overfitting short-term noise. This raises target base stock to cover an extra period of demand given missing arrivals while keeping volatility estimate unchanged so the capped order limit still applies.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived in conclude messages (3 consecutive periods); likely actual lead time >2 or lost shipments.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
457892003: ordered=78, arrived=110 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=110, demand=48, sold=48, ending on-hand inventory=62
Daily Profit: $48.00, Daily Holding Cost: $62.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded info: Period 4 arrival shows order placed P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (matches promised), but orders from P1 and P3 did not conclude (missing/delayed shipments across 3 periods). Current inventory: on-hand=62, in-transit=201. I set L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (observed = 2 from P2->P4) so we anchor to confirmed lead time while allowing future updates if more arrives. Demand forecast uses default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) because available historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) are limited but show no clear sustained mean shift yet; this provides a stable baseline for base-stock. Sigma uses default to reflect historical variability. These settings balance service (use confirmed lead time, full-sample demand/volatility) while remaining conservative about missing shipments (we did not inflate demand forecast without multi-period demand evidence).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); Missing/delayed shipments confirmed: orders placed in Periods 1 and 3 have not concluded (3 consecutive periods) \u2014 possible lost or delayed shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=28, in-transit=201. History shows one concluded lead time = 2 (Period 2\u21924) while some earlier orders remain missing/delayed; evidence supports using observed lead-time data only. I select L via 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (reflecting the confirmed L=2). Demand history is limited and shows no clear seasonal shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies a standard (L+1)-period forecast. This balances service (use observed lead time) against holding cost conservatively given profit=holding cost parity and the risk of lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized demand has dropped: Periods 4-6 demands = 48,34,42 (sustained lower regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=201; observed concluded lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4) but several earlier orders never concluded, indicating possible lost/delayed shipments\u2014so rely on observed lead-time history rather than promised uncertainty. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=2. Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent demand regime (last 3 periods) to capture the sustained lower demand and reduce over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 4-6 avg demand = 41.3, down from earlier sample mean ~83.6 (\u2248 -50%); sustained for 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has shifted lower: Periods 4-6 avg = 41.3 (vs earlier mean ~83.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=201; prior concludes show a confirmed lead time=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) but multiple earlier orders remain missing/delayed. To be conservative on forecast I use a recent-window demand estimate (captures the lower regime) and recent volatility. For lead time I use calculated (average of observed lead times) which is 2 based on concluded arrivals. These settings bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of the verified lower-demand regime while acknowledging in-transit stock and possible lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). History shows a confirmed lead time observation: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). Recent demand has dropped from historical mean (~83.6) to a lower regime around Periods 4\u20138 with more variability and a late spike (Periods 4\u20138 demands = 48,34,42,32,72; mean=45.6). To capture the recent regime I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std (uses Periods 4\u20138) so the OR engine targets a base-stock covering the current lower-demand regime while still reacting to the recent spike. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit stock) against holding cost given profit=holding= $1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 => observed lead time = 2 (confirms promised lead time). Demand has shifted downward vs. the Jan samples; recent concluded demands (Periods 5-9 = 34,42,32,72,40) are more representative. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent lower demand while letting the OR engine compute pipeline-aware base stock, I set L by calculating average observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility weight the most recent regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has moved down vs. historical (earlier mean ~83.6; recent periods show much lower demand with a confirmed regime shift around Periods 4\u20136). Pipeline shows 201 units in-transit; some earlier orders were delayed/lost but observed arrivals confirm at least one lead time =2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (evidence: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower-demand regime (last 5 observed demands: P6\u2013P10 = 42,32,72,40,24) and reduce target stock accordingly; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices lower the base-stock vs. long-run history to avoid excess holding given holding cost = profit and the clear demand decline, while still accounting for in-transit inventory and lead-time evidence.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded arrivals show a confirmed lead time observation of 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); many earlier orders experienced delays/losses but recent concluded data is limited. Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 32,72,40,24,50) shows a lower regime vs initial sample mean; no new 3+ period sustained changepoint beyond the previously recorded shift. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence (average observed = 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 5-period demand pattern (captures the post-shift lower mean while smoothing recent variability). This balances service (use recent demand to avoid overstock) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows at least one 2-period arrival (Period 2\u21924) and prior missing shipments; use observed lead-time average. Demand has shifted down since Period 4 (recent periods 4\u201312 mean \u224841.7 vs earlier \u224883.6); use recent demand window to reflect the lower regime. Set L by calculate to use observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (regime from P4\u2013P12, length=9) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods at the new lower mean while capturing recent volatility, reducing overstocks from legacy higher-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has been lower than the Jan samples; Periods 4\u201313 show a sustained lower regime vs earlier historical mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=201 \u2014 visible pipeline is large but prior missing arrivals occurred; we have one confirmed observed lead time = 2 (Period 2\u21924). I set L by calculation (use observed lead times average) to reflect confirmed L=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (covering Periods 4\u201313 where the lower-demand regime is sustained) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples; sigma_hat also recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching the OR backend's base-stock to the current lower-demand regime while respecting the confirmed lead time and avoiding overstating demand (which would increase holding cost given unit holding=$1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Demand has shifted down since Periods 4-6 and recent weeks (Periods 7-14) show a lower regime (recent 8-period avg \u2248 38 units vs earlier mean \u2248 83.6). To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the recent regime (recent_N) to reflect the lower mean and volatility. Using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns base-stock with the current lower-demand regime and reduces holding cost risk while preserving service.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained lower weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (pipeline sufficient but some earlier orders were delayed/lost historically; one observed lead time=2). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (covers Periods 4\u201315 recent regime) so mu_hat reflects the reduced mean over the sustained lower-demand window. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concl: lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Demand has shifted down starting around Period 4 and this lower regime has persisted through Period 16. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default=2) and use recent_N on demand to capture the post-changepoint mean/volatility (use last 13 periods since the regime began). These parameters will reduce target base-stock relative to the historical long-run mean, avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit and profit=$1/unit while preserving service during the current lower-demand regime.

Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 4-6 (avg ~41) vs earlier sample mean ~84; on-hand=0, in-transit=201 (supply exists but several early orders showed delayed/lost behaviour). Use L="calculate" to let backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (evidence: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 => lead time=2). For demand, use recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime from Period 4 onward (covers periods 4\u201317 available samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding overstating demand (reduce excess holding) while acknowledging confirmed lead-time=2 and existing in-transit stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical conclude messages confirm at least one order with lead time=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Multiple earlier missing shipments were observed but later evidence confirms actual lead time = 2; demand has shifted down since Periods 4\u20136 and the low-demand regime persists through recent periods. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (uses observed evidence rather than promised). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the most recent sustained low-demand regime to capture the lower mean and variance; N=15 (Periods 4\u201318) reflects the sustained regime length per carry-over notes and available samples. These choices reduce overstating required pipeline while preserving service given current low demand and the confirmed lead time; they also avoid building excess inventory while some in-transit units remain.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: Period2 order arrived in Period4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2. Demand has shifted down since Periods 4\u20136 (previous carry-over) and recent weeks remain low (last 5 demands: 17,24,6,5,15). To reflect confirmed lead time and the sustained lower demand regime, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a (1+L)-period forecast based on the most recent low-demand data while keeping volatility tuned to recent variability. This also avoids over-ordering despite a large in-transit balance and accounts for possible earlier missing shipments by relying on concluded lead-time observations rather than unconfirmed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead-time evidence includes a P2\u2192P4 arrival (lead_time=2); several earlier placed orders were delayed/lost but later evidence supports a 2-period lead time. Demand dropped starting Periods 4-6 and has stayed lower since; recent regime length ~17 periods (P4\u2013P20). I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (reflects confirmed 2-period observation). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the post-shift regime. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the sustained lower demand while acknowledging pipeline (201 units) to avoid over-ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has been well below historical pre-period levels (sustained lower regime detected in Periods 4-6 and continued through subsequent weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (pipeline present). Promised lead time is 2 and earlier concludes confirmed lead_time=2 for at least one arrival, so use default lead time. To reflect the persistent downward demand regime, use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent low-demand weeks (capture current mean and volatility). N=10 balances recency with sample stability and is within available sample count. This reduces target base-stock and holding while preserving service against the current lower demand pattern.

Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Periods 4\u20136 and persistently low weekly demand in recent weeks (last 5 demands: 5,15,11,8,5 \u2192 mean \u22488.8). Promised lead time is 2 and earlier concludes confirmed lead time=2; use default L to keep OR backend alignment. To reflect the new low-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent_N (last 5 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling captures low current demand and reduced volatility, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded arrivals show a confirmed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and many earlier shipments were missing; however recent concluded evidence supports LT=2. Demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 4\u20136 and remained low through recent weeks (most recent 5 demands: 15,11,8,5,29). To protect service while avoiding excess holding (profit=$1, holding=$1 so q=0.5), I set L based on observed lead times, and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the sustained low regime. This balances service (captures recent lower mean) against holding cost and accounts for the visible in-transit stock the backend will offset against pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concludes show one confirmed lead time=2 (Period 2\u21924) and multiple missing/delayed shipments earlier; demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 4-6 (sustained lower weekly sales). To be conservative I set L to calculated average of observed lead times (uses concluded evidence). For demand I use recent_N (last 20 weeks) to capture the persistent lower-demand regime and reduce forecast bias from earlier high samples. Volatility also set from the same recent window so safety stock matches current variability. This balances service (use recent demand) vs. holding cost (avoid basing orders on older larger mean).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (earlier sample mean ~83.6 vs Periods 4-6 avg 41.3), and this lower level has persisted through Period 25. On-hand=0, in-transit=201 units (pipeline present but several earlier orders showed delayed/lost behavior; one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2). I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (use last ~20 samples to capture current mean/volatility). This reduces overstating required base stock given holding cost equals profit, and balances service level vs holding cost while accounting for persistent lower demand and past shipment irregularities.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (from early orders); historical concludes show some delayed/lost shipments but a confirmed lead time observation exists (Period 2\u21924). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4. I set L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (reflecting the confirmed 2-period observation while allowing any other concluded observations to inform the estimate). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained low-demand regime (Periods 4\u201326), improving service/holding balance given much lower demand versus the early-sample mean. This also hedges against relying on early high-demand samples and helps reduce excess ordering while in-transit inventory is substantial.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended: Periods 4\u201326 avg demand = 27.91 (642 over 23 periods), down from earlier sample mean \u224883.6 (\u2248 -66.6%); sustained low-demand regime confirmed.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (Periods 4\u201326 avg \u224827.91) despite a spike in Period 27; lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior concludes. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=201 (covers multiple future periods). To avoid overstock in the sustained low-demand regime while preserving service, keep L at promised (default). Set demand forecast using recent data from the low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent 20 weeks of realized demand (captures the low regime while smoothing the Period 27 blip). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias ordering toward the lower, sustained demand level and reduce holding cost risk given large in-transit volume.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Historical concluded data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (Periods 4\u201326 avg = 27.91 units/week); on-hand=0, in-transit=201. Promised lead time = 2 but concluded lead-time evidence is sparse and mixed (one confirmed LT=2 and earlier missing shipments); I will use the promised lead time (default) to avoid over-correcting for possibly lost shipments. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the OR forecast with the sustained low-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules) so base-stock reflects current lower weekly demand while keeping volatility estimated from recent observations. This balances service (avoid stockouts while 201 units in-transit exist) against holding costs in a low-demand environment.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 4 (Periods 4\u201326 avg \u224827.91); recent weekly demands remain low. On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (sufficient pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude messages confirm lead_time=2 for observed arrivals, so use default lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent stable data (use N=20 capped by rule). Volatility likewise uses recent_N with N=20 to capture recent variability. These choices keep base-stock low to avoid holding cost while the in-transit quantity covers near-term demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (avg ~27.9) vs. earlier ~83.6. On-hand=0 with in-transit=201 \u2014 pipeline likely covers several weeks of current demand. Observed lead time evidence includes a confirmed 2-period arrival (Period 2\u21924). To capture the sustained lower-demand regime and recent volatility, set L to be calculated from observed lead-times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent regime without overfitting). This reduces target base-stock relative to historical highs and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 Period 32. On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical conclude messages confirm a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 4 (Periods 4\u201326 avg \u224827.9) and no recent lead-time surprises after Period 5 (lead time confirmed 2). To avoid overstock given Profit=Holding ($1) and sustained lower demand, keep promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime. I detect the changepoint at Period 4; regime length since then is >20, so use recent_N with N=20 to capture the low regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reduces forecast bias from the earlier high-demand samples while allowing the OR backend to compute a conservative base-stock that balances service vs holding cost given the current in-transit units.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time 2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and a sustained low-demand regime since Period4 (Periods4\u201326 avg ~27.9). No new evidence of further lead-time drift or recovered demand. I use default lead time (promised L=2). For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (cap recent window at 20 per rules) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, biasing stocking toward the confirmed lower demand and limiting holding cost exposure while preserving service for expected demand covered by pipeline (201 units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead time evidence: one confirmed arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period 2\u21924); earlier shipments showed delays/losses but later confirms support promised-2. Demand recent window (Periods 27\u201333) shows sustained uptick vs prior low regime. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (leveraging the confirmed 2-period observation) while acknowledging past missing shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=7, Periods 27\u201333) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand and its volatility (captures the regime shift). This raises the base-stock to meet higher realized demand while the recent sigma increases safety stock; with profit=holding, this balances service and inventory risk given uncertain past shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 27: Periods 27\u201333 avg demand = 53.14 vs prior Periods 4\u201326 avg = 27.91 (+90%); sustained for 7 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 units (pipeline present from earlier orders). Historical demand shows a sustained regime change since Period 27 with recent 8-period avg \u224854.4/week (Periods 27\u201334). One confirmed lead-time observation equals promised 2 periods (Period2\u2192Period4). I therefore keep L at the promised/default to match observed confirmation. To make the OR engine responsive to the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 27\u201334), I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) so (1+L)*mean reflects the latest 8 weeks. Volatility also set from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=8) to capture current demand variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given 201 units in-transit but uncertain arrivals) against holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the most recent regime while not overreacting to single-week spikes.

Historical concludes show at least one order with lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and many earlier missing arrivals, but recent arrivals confirm promised lead time is reliable; keep L as default (promised=2). Recent demand regime (Periods 27\u201335) shows higher, sustained demand vs prior low regime; to capture the current regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (Periods 27\u201335) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand around the recent pattern. This balances service (avoid stockouts given the recent higher demand) against holding cost by relying on pipeline (201 units) and using recent volatility for safety stock instead of long-term historical higher variance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent concluded demand (Periods 27\u201336) elevated vs earlier low regime; last 10 concluded weeks avg \u224864.7 (Periods 27\u201336) so I use a recent-window forecast. No new confirmed lead-time change in concluded history beyond earlier confirmations; promised lead time (2) remains appropriate for the OR engine. On-hand is 0 and in-transit=201 (large pipeline) so keep L=default and tighten demand estimate to recent behavior to avoid under-ordering when pipeline depletes. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised 2; mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to reflect the recent higher-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 to capture recent volatility. These parameters steer the backend toward a base stock that balances unit profit vs holding cost given the recent upward demand while acknowledging the large in-transit units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand (Periods 28\u201337) has rebounded vs earlier low regime; last 10 weeks avg demand = 59.5 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (pipeline adequate). Observed concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 in earlier evidence (Period 4 showed P2\u2192P4). Use promised/default lead time to match supplier promise. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (3-period review+lead means scale by 1+L). This balances service (capture current demand uptick) while avoiding excess stock since pipeline is sizeable.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 27 (recent 12-week mean \u224860.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 covers ~3\xd760.5 demand (L+1 periods) so pipeline is adequate. I set L by calculating observed lead times (observed arrival shows 2). For demand I use the recent 12-week regime to capture the shifted mean/volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat recent_N with N=12) so the OR backend will size base stock to the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and many earlier lost/delayed shipments, but no sustained evidence of a new lead-time regime; therefore keep promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated since Period 27 with a sustained regime; use recent samples to capture current mean/variance. Set L to default (promised). Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast on the last 13 demand observations (Periods 27\u201339) so the OR backend targets service for the current higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Last observed arrival was Period 4 (confirms some shipments can have 2-period lead time), but many intervening periods showed no arrivals. Demand has clearly risen in recent weeks vs the long low regime; latest 5 concluded weeks (Periods 36-40) average ~70 units/week. I choose L=default (use promised 2) since lead time was previously confirmed and evidence of systematic longer lead time is inconclusive. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime without over-weighting older low-demand history. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet near-term higher demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=212. Historical concludes confirm realized lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) but many earlier orders showed long/no arrivals; in-transit stock likely includes delayed shipments. Demand has rebounded since Period 34 (recent weeks high). To balance service vs holding cost I keep promised lead time (use default L) but bias demand estimates to the recent higher regime: use recent_N over the last 8 periods (Periods 34\u201341) to capture the current elevated demand and volatility so the OR backend raises base stock enough to meet higher near-term demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Periods 34\u201341 avg demand = 70.63 vs prior Periods 27\u201333 avg = 53.14 (+33%), sustained for 8 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): recent demand has been elevated and volatile (several weeks 60\u2013118) after earlier sustained low regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=212 units. Historical conclude messages confirm at least one order with lead time=2 and intermittent missing/delayed shipments, but the only reliably observed lead-time samples support L\u22482. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed evidence rather than the promised value). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history \u2014 this balances service level for the now-higher, variable demand while leveraging all historical data given regime uncertainty and intermittent lost shipments. The large in-transit (212) should already provide coverage for (1+L) periods; using defaults avoids overreacting to recent spikes that may be temporary or caused by restitution of previously missing inventory.

No new sustained demand regime change in the most recent 3 concluded periods. Use calculate for L to lock in observed lead-time evidence; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L). This balances service (observed LT=2) vs holding cost given current large in-transit.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 34 (avg ~70); to focus the base-stock on the recent regime I use a recent-window forecast. Choices: L kept at promised/default (2) consistent with observed 2; mu_hat set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent ~8-period elevated demand; sigma_hat set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. This biases ordering toward meeting the current higher demand while containing holding cost by using a recent rather than all-time mean.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=223. Recent concluded lead-time observations (Period2\u21924, Period41\u219243) confirm actual lead time \u22482; earlier missing arrivals appear to be isolated/lost but more recent evidence aligns with promised L=2. Demand regime has risen since Period 34 (Period34\u201345 avg \u224870) so I use a recent-demand window that captures this higher regime. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (supported by recent concluded arrivals), mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 12 demand observations (regime length from Period34\u201345 = 12) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using recent, higher-demand data. This balances service (higher recent demand) with holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 for observed arrivals (Period 2\u21924 and Period 41\u219243). Recent demand regime (Periods 34\u201346) is elevated and sustained (avg \u224870.6); use recent-sample estimates to reflect this regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=223 (large pipeline) \u2014 keep promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the most recent regime to avoid understocking when in-transit arrives. Chosen methods: L kept at promised lead time to match confirmed observations; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (periods 34\u201346) to capture the current regime and its volatility so the OR backend sets a base-stock appropriate to higher recent demand while the cap prevents excessive single-period orders.
