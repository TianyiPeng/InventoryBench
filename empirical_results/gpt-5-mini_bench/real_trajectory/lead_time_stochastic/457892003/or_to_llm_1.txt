Confirmed arrivals: P2\u2192arrived in P4 (lead_time=2 as promised); P5\u2192arrived in P6 (lead_time=1). Multiple earlier orders (P1,P3,P4,P8) remain unobserved well past promised L=2, matching prior Period 4 insight: pipeline is unreliable and some shipments may be lost or severely delayed. Demand outlook: historical single-period mean from provided samples \u224883.6 units/week; recent weeks show volatility including a 72 sale in P8 and several 30\u201348 weeks. OR's base-stock/capped policy returned 0 because it trusts promised L and counts pipeline=251 toward pipeline_inventory. Adjustment logic: Because the observed pipeline contains large overdue/possibly-lost shipments, I cannot fully rely on it to meet upcoming demand. However, holding cost equals profit ($1=$1) so over-ordering is costly; we should be conservative yet ensure some coverage if in-transit never arrives. Target: cover roughly one period of expected demand (single-period mean \u224884) with a conservative safety buffer rather than matching OR's 0. Action chosen: order 84 units (\u2248single-period mean). This mitigates immediate stockout risk if in-transit is lost while avoiding large holding costs if in-transit subsequently arrives.
