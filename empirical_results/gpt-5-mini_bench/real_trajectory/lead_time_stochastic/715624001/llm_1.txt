Historical lead time has varied (observed 1\u20133 periods) so arrivals could be delayed, but current in-transit quantity (1150) exceeds 3\xd7forecast(\u2248600) so no immediate replenishment needed. Inventory economics: Profit=$19/unit >> holding=$1/unit; however excess ending inventory incurs holding cost each period, and current pipeline already provides high coverage. Action: place no order to avoid unnecessary holding cost while in-transit inventory is sufficient to meet near-term demand and to observe actual arrivals for lead-time confirmation.",
