Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand data shows a clear upward shift beginning 2019-01-28 (week of 215 then 302). On-hand and in-transit are zero so we must cover review+lead demand. I use promised lead time (default L=2). For demand I focus on the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher mean and volatility of the last three weeks (2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04). This increases target base-stock to balance service level against holding cost given the spike; no delayed shipments observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-28: previous early-Jan average \u224837.3 (2019-01-07..2019-01-21) vs recent 3-week average =190.0 (2019-01-21..2019-02-04), +409%.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=398 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). Promised L=2 remains default since no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-28 (recent high demand in last 3 samples). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples to capture the higher mean and volatility (N=3), so base-stock reflects the new, elevated demand while L stays default to avoid overcorrecting for an unconfirmed lead-time change.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=755 (orders from P1/P2). No concluded arrivals yet so do not infer a lead-time change; keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a clear regime shift starting 2019-01-28 (recent 3-week avg \u2248190 vs earlier ~37). Use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility to capture the new higher-demand regime and to size base-stock accordingly while avoiding over-reacting to older low-demand weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand regime jump confirmed (post-2019-01-28 weekly mean \u2248190 over last 3 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=846 but three consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 \u2192 shipments overdue or lead-time longer than promised. To be conservative, set lead time explicit=3 to cover observed delays. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (last three samples: 53,215,302 -> weekly mean 190; with L=3 the review+lead multiplier is 1+L=4). This increases target base_stock to cover elevated demand while sigma based on recent_N=3 captures current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $603.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-28 (recent weeks much larger than early-Jan). On-hand=309 + in-transit=489 gives ample pipeline but several earlier orders were delayed and later confirmed with observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Therefore use promised/default lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (last 3 samples) to capture the new high-demand regime (changepoint at 2019-01-28). Use sigma recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This biases base-stock upward to avoid stockouts in the new regime while keeping holding cost in mind.

Daily Reward (R_t): $671.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). On-hand=260 + in-transit=489 = 749 units in pipeline; pipeline comfortably covers multiple periods of observed weekly demand (~48\u2013131 historically). No new sustained changepoint since prior insight, so use default/robust settings: L default (promised lead time), mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, sigma_hat default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids overreacting to short-term demand fluctuation while the large pipeline reduces stockout risk.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand regime: late-Jan\u2192early-Feb spike confirmed (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 avg=190 vs early Jan avg\u224837). Observed lead time evidence: Period 4 conclude shows order from Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2 (matches promised). Several earlier orders (Period 1) never concluded -> possible lost shipment but insufficient sustained pattern to record as new insight. On-hand=209, in-transit=489; pipeline is large versus recent weekly demand (~48\u201351 in Mar). To prioritize service for the new, higher demand regime while recognizing available stock, set L by calculating observed lead times (use measured data). For demand forecast use recent_N=3 (focus on the elevated regime: 215,302, and 53/53? actually last three high-week samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean/volatility and avoid being pulled down by sparse early-Jan data. This balances higher service (captures spike) against holding cost given current ample inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=160, in-transit=489. Confirmed observed lead time = 2 periods (Period2 order arrived Period4). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-7) = [48,49,51,49], avg \u224849.25. No new sustained changepoint since prior spike; current regime appears stable near 49 units/week. To align forecast with the most recent regime and keep safety appropriate for promised lead time, use default L (promised 2), set mu_hat from the recent 4 demand samples (captures current ~49 mean across review+lead), and set sigma_hat from the recent 4 samples to reflect current volatility. This balances service (matching recent demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-8) \u2248 [48,49,51,49,52] (~50/week). Pipeline large (in-transit=489) from earlier orders; some earlier orders (Period3) appear lost but we only infer from concluded messages. Lead time: one observed conclusion shows Period2 order arrived in Period4 => actual LT evidence =2. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect the sustained ~50/week pattern over last five concluded weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. These parameters steer the OR engine to target service for current stable demand while accounting for existing large pipeline and minimizing extra holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized weekly demand since arrivals (Periods 4-9) is stable ~48\u201352 (6 samples), much lower than the Jan spike. On-hand=57, in-transit=489 => pipeline large relative to demand; no new missing-shipment signal. Set L to calculated average observed lead time (observed = 2). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast/volatility on the most recent stable regime (Periods 4-9). This keeps target base stock aligned to current ~50/wk demand while preventing overstating demand from the earlier spike, balancing service level vs holding cost given significant pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Current on-hand=38, in-transit=489 => pipeline+on-hand=527, which comfortably covers multiple weeks. Recent demand since arrivals (Periods 4\u201310) shows a stable weekly demand regime around ~48\u201352 with one low week (19) in Period 10; the most recent 7-period mean = 45.6. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 2 periods. To capture the current post-arrival demand regime I set L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to base the (1+L) forecast on the recent stable regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current realized demand and avoids overstock given large pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-11) averages ~50.8 units with moderate variability; latest period showed a one-off spike (87) that caused stockout but not a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (coverage ~9.7 weeks at recent mean). Lead time has been observed as 2 periods (matches promise). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use the promised/confirmed lead time and base mu/sigma on the recent 8-week regime (Periods 4-11) so the OR backend forecasts using current demand levels (captures post-jan uplift) and recent volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-06: recent weeks show elevated and variable demand with several large weeks (87,129) and on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Promised lead time is 2; past conclude messages confirmed actual lead time=2. In-transit (489) already provides substantial cover for (1+L) review+lead demand, so use default lead time and default demand stats to let the OR engine compute base-stock given historical samples. This avoids overreacting to recent spikes while keeping inventory sufficient for service with moderate holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (likely covering multiple outstanding orders). Historical concluded lead time evidence confirms 2-period behavior earlier; promised LT=2. Recent demand (Periods 8-13) = [52,51,19,87,129,68], recent mean \u224867.7/week. To align orders with current demand regime and limit holding cost, I use L=default (promised 2), mu_hat based on recent_N=6 (captures most recent demand pattern since late-Mar through early-May), and sigma_hat recent_N=6 to reflect recent volatility rather than older Jan spike data. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of recent mean demand) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand (last 6 weeks: 51,19,87,129,68,70) shows elevated and volatile weekly sales vs early-Jan baseline; confirmed lead time = 2 (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=489 units \u2014 pipeline currently covers multiple review+lead periods so no aggressive uplift needed. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 2-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime and volatility (3-week spikes present) so the OR backend will size base-stock to meet current higher mean while reflecting recent variability and avoiding excess holding costs given large in-transit volume.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand 0, in-transit 489. Historical series shows an established higher-demand regime since 2019-01-28; recent weekly demands (Periods 4\u201315) average ~67\u201370/week with some volatility and intermittent spikes (87,129). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods. To reflect the post-changepoint regime and prioritize service given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1), I use promised lead time (default) and compute demand statistics from the recent 12 weeks (most recent coherent regime). This gives the OR engine a forecast focused on current demand levels and recent volatility, improving fill rates while limiting excess holding given the large in-transit quantity.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent 5-period observed demand (Periods 12-16) = [129,68,70,82,64], average \u224882.6 indicating a sustained higher post-stockout demand vs earlier mid-March regime (~51). Lead-time observation: one confirmed observation shows 2 periods. I set L to calculate (use observed lead times average). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated regime (covers the 5 most recent observed demands). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind given holding=$1/unit and profit=$19/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 4 message). Recent realized demand (most relevant) is from Periods 12-17: [129,68,70,82,64,48], average \u224876.8/week. To reflect the current demand regime and keep service while avoiding excess holding given large in-transit, I use promised lead time (default=2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (the six most recent observed demands) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current regime. This balances higher recent demand against substantial in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude messages confirmed LT=2; I therefore keep L as default (use promised). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-28; recent demand (Periods 10\u201318) is variable but represents the current regime, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to focus the OR forecast on the most relevant recent 9 demand observations. This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent observed demand (Periods 12-19): [129,68,70,82,64,48,58,18], avg \u224874.1 \u2014 demand has moderated from the Jan spike but remains nonzero and variable. On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (pipeline present). Lead-time evidence: prior concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4); no contradictory concludes since. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-times (captures confirmed L=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the last 8 observed weekly demands (captures the post-spike regime average \u224874\xd7(1+L)). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep orders responsive to the current, lower-volatility regime while respecting the confirmed lead time and existing in-transit pipeline to avoid overstock given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Historical recent demand (Periods 4\u201320) shows stable lower regime vs the early-Jan spike; I use recent data to forecast. Lead time kept as promised (2) consistent with earlier confirmed observation. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 17 observed demand periods (Periods 4\u201320) so the OR engine targets service for the current low-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost; this leverages the 3-period review+lead aggregation (1+L) in backend calculations.

To focus the forecast on the most relevant recent weeks, I use recent_N=11 (Periods 11\u201321) for demand mean and volatility while leaving lead time at the promised/default value (confirmed by past concl.). This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

In-transit stock is sizable relative to recent weekly demands, so use promised/default lead time and population-wide demand stats to let the OR backend compute base_stock and caps consistently. Default mu_hat/sigma_hat let the OR engine use all samples (stability) while avoiding overfitting to short recent spikes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=489. Recent demand has moved to a higher regime: the last 3 weeks show 104, 201, 199 units (Periods 21-23) after several low-demand weeks. Promised lead time is 2 and earlier history confirmed LT=2 (Period 4 conclude). To capture the recent upward demand while keeping safety for the 1+L review+lead horizon, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 6 demand observations (Periods 18-23: 58,18,19,104,201,199) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over this recent window. I also use recent_N (N=6) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. I keep L as default (promised) because concluded evidence supports LT=2 and there is no new multi-period loss pattern. These choices raise target base stock to meet the sustained higher weekly demand while the sigma estimate increases safety stock for observed volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=539. Recent demand has jumped since Period 21 (104,201,199,66) indicating a new high-demand regime beginning in early July. Lead time evidence (Period 4 conclude: P2\u2192P4) supports actual L\u22482. I select L by calculating average observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new July regime (periods 21-24). For volatility I use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variability. These settings raise base-stock to meet elevated near-term demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variance and confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has stepped up since early July (Periods 21-25: 104,201,199,66,110) indicating a higher recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=622 (includes recent orders from P24/P25 which will arrive during this period and be visible in P27 conclude). Promised lead time is 2 and earlier history (Period 4 conclude) confirmed a 2-period actual lead time; no sustained evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. I therefore keep L at the promised/default, but bias demand estimates to the recent high-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples (recent_N with N=5, capturing Periods 21-25). This raises the backend base-stock and cap to improve service during the current high-demand regime while keeping holding-cost tradeoff manageable given profit/holding parameters.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=622. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 (Period 4 show P2\u2192P4). Recent demand has risen (Periods 21-26: 104,201,199,66,110,208) so I use a short recent-window forecast. Set L to promised (default) so OR backend uses promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (last 6 concluded demand samples) to capture the current higher/volatile regime and keep orders aligned with the recent demand pattern given large in-transit volume.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been high and volatile since late June (Periods 21-27: 104,201,199,66,110,208,322) indicating a sustained higher regime vs earlier months. On-hand=0 but in-transit=539 units (large pipeline). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 2 periods. To capture the recent elevated demand while respecting the promised L=2, I use default lead time and base mu/sigma estimates on the most recent regime (last 7 weeks) so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting current demand and variability; this avoids understocking during the recent high-demand regime while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=766. Historical concluded lead time = 2 (confirmed earlier); use promised lead time. Recent demand shows elevated and volatile weekly sales (recent 6 weeks: 199,66,110,208,322,83; mean\u2248164.7). Using recent_N (N=6) for demand mean and volatility captures the current high-demand regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand weeks. With L=default (2), (1+L)\xd7recent_mean \u2248 3\xd7164.7 -> backend will set base stock to serve ~3 weeks. In-transit (766) comfortably covers ~3\xd7mean (~495) so no emergency over-ordering is needed; using recent_N for sigma ensures safety stock reflects current variability and prevents excessive holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$19, holding=$1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. Promised lead time = 2 and past concluded evidence confirms a 2-period lead (Period 2\u21924, Period 25\u219227). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=771 units (will cover many weeks). Demand has a sustained higher regime since late June/July (Period 21 onward: demands 104,201,199,66,110,208,322,83,63) \u2014 recent regime length = 9. To capture the current high-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 2), and use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 9 samples, which balances service level for the elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand weeks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 2 (arrivals from P2\u2192P4 and P25\u2192P27). On-hand=130, in-transit=544 (large pipeline). Demand has two regimes: low early-2019 and higher summer activity (many weeks with ~100\u2013322). I treat lead time as promised (default) because concluded arrivals support L=2. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the summer/autumn higher-demand regime (use last ~10 weeks to reflect the sustained elevated demand and avoid dilution by early low-demand weeks). Using recent_N for sigma_hat matches the same recent window so safety stock reflects current volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to meet elevated service needs while the capped order prevents excessive single-period replenishment given high pipeline inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Current on-hand=113, in-transit=545 => large pipeline already covering multiple weeks of demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2\u21924, 25\u219227, 28\u219230). Recent demand is volatile but we have substantial pipeline; with profit $19 vs holding $1 the service-level target is high (q\u22480.95). To avoid overreacting to demand noise and to let the backend compute the safety stock using full-sample stats and promised lead time, I choose the defaults for lead time, mu_hat and sigma_hat. This leverages the backend's base-stock formula while avoiding additional replenishment given the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Current on-hand=80, in-transit=544. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with one recent 1-period arrival; overall observed average ~1.75 so use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. Recent demand has been variable but last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 28-32 = 83,63,97,17,34) indicate a lower recent mean vs earlier spikes, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime. These choices keep target stock responsive to the recent lower demand while the backend will account for pipeline; using recent statistics reduces overstock risk given the large in-transit volume.

Demand recent 8 weeks show elevated and volatile demand (Periods 26-33: 208,322,83,63,97,17,34,84). To reflect confirmed typical lead time while letting backend compute a robust average, set L='calculate'.

Recent demand has been elevated and variable since July\u2013Sep; to reflect the recent regime and avoid stockouts despite large pipeline, I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N demand estimates to tune the base-stock to current demand levels. Choosing N=8 captures the most recent two-month window (covers the high-demand summer/autumn regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean and volatility.

Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (recent weekly demands: ...63,97,17,34,84,98,131 over last 8 periods) with multiple confirmed 2-period lead-time arrivals historically but one 1-period anomaly. On-hand=0, in-transit=631 \u2014 large pipeline present so avoid over-ordering. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the dominant 2-period signal while allowing the 1-period anomaly to influence the mean). For demand I use recent_N N=12 to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures summer/autumn elevated demand and recent volatility) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the base-stock and cap reflect current higher mean and variability without reacting to very old low-Jan samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline variability) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=631 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals delayed by lead time). Historical concluded lead times observed = [2,2,2,1] (most recent 4). Recent demand (Periods 27-36) = [322,83,63,97,17,34,84,98,131,117], mean \u2248114 over last 10 with noticeable variability. I set L using recent_N (N=4) to capture the prevailing 2-period lead-time signal while allowing the single 1-period blip to be downweighted. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime (captures late-summer/early-fall higher demand). These parameter choices align the OR backend's base-stock toward current demand levels while reflecting observed lead-time behavior and avoiding overreaction to single-period noise.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=0, in-transit=631. Historical concludes show mostly 2-period actual lead time (one 1-period anomaly); previous carry-over confirmed LT=2. Recent demand has increased in Oct: Periods 34-37 demands = [98,131,117,160], suggesting a higher recent mean than the long-run. I keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded history supports promised lead time and one short arrival is noise. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent regime (last ~8 weeks) so mu_hat reflects the Oct uptick; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect against stockouts during sustained higher demand while limiting excess holding cost since substantial pipeline (631) already exists.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=631. Historical demand has been elevated and volatile since mid-2019 (notable spikes Jul\u2013Sep and sustained higher weekly demand Aug\u2013Oct). Promised lead time=2 and prior conclude messages confirm 2-period arrivals; no new lead-time evidence since. To capture the recent higher/volatile regime I use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand samples cover 2019-09-09..2019-10-28) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current demand level and variability. L kept as default (promised) because observed lead-time evidence is already recorded and no new sustained change is detected. These settings push the OR backend to stock for the (1+L) review+lead window using recent demand while keeping variability-driven safety stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=631 \u2014 large pipeline inventory exists from prior orders. Recent concluded arrivals confirm lead time behavior has mostly been 2 periods (earlier carry-over noted); occasional 1-period arrival occurred but not sustained. No new sustained demand regime shift detected since summer. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service level given substantial in-transit stock while avoiding extra inventory holding given low holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand (Periods 34-40) shows a sustained higher regime vs early-year: demands = [98,131,117,160,93,81,104], mean \u2248116.9. On-hand=0, in-transit=631 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-time observations previously confirmed 2 periods; promised LT=2. I set L to default (use promised 2). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent post-summer demand regime (N=7 is the length of this recent stable window, within 3..20). Same recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to current elevated demand while the large in-transit stock limits immediate ordering to avoid excess holding cost.

Recent demand (last 8 weeks, Periods 34-41) averages \u2248109.9/wk with moderate variance; no new sustained changepoint since earlier reported Jan shift. Lead time historically confirmed at 2 and promised lead time is 2, so retain default L. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime (keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while the large in-transit position will be accounted for by the OR engine). Carry no new long-term insight.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and variable in Oct\u2013Nov (examples: P37..P43 = 160,93,81,104,95,148,65). On-hand=0 with 631 units in-transit (large pipeline). Prior evidence confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 9). I use L=default to trust promised lead time (2) which matches observed history; this lets OR use its known-lead-time model. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (last ~6 concluded weeks) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand and avoids understocking. I also use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and set safety stock appropriately. No new sustained changepoint or missing-shipment pattern to record.

Promised lead time remains 2 and prior conclude messages confirm LT\u22482. To capture the recent elevated demand I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime while keeping L default to promised lead time.

Recent weeks show elevated and variable holiday demand (e.g. Period 45 demand=233) but not a clear sustained new regime; to avoid overfitting to short spike and because large pipeline exists, use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This balances service (protects against typical demand) while avoiding excess hold given holding cost=$1 and pipeline=631 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=631. Promised lead time=2 (previously confirmed as 2). Recent demand shows a late-Dec uplift (periods 44-46) with higher mean and volatility versus earlier autumn. To protect service during the current Dec spike while avoiding excessive holding cost after season, I use default lead time (promised=2) and set demand estimates from the most recent 4 weeks to capture the spike and current variance. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4) lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts this period while keeping cap constraints for safety. 

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 44-46 (2019-12-02..2019-12-23) recent mean=150.5 units/week vs prior Periods 40-43 mean=103.0 (+46%), sustained 3+ weeks.
