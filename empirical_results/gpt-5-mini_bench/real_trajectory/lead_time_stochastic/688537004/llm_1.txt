Current on-hand 8 and in-transit 866 (includes long-outstanding P1/P3 + P10 + P12).

On-hand=0 but in-transit=1136 units \u2014 this pipeline alone can cover many weeks of current winter demand (1136 / 39 \u2248 29 weeks). Lead time has varied historically (1\u20133 periods) but recent pipeline arrivals are occurring; no new evidence of lost shipments. Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit is $4/unit, so excess inventory reduces objective. Therefore place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and let existing in-transit inventory satisfy demand through the low season.",
