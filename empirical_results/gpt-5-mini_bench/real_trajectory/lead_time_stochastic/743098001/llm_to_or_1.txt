Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (week of Feb 11). Product is a womens necklace\u2014Valentine's Day (Feb 14) likely causes a short, immediate demand spike vs. historical Jan samples (mean=32.8/week). No on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time, so keep L as promised. To cover the near-term Valentine uplift I set mu_hat explicitly higher than the default (covering review+lead period demand). sigma_hat left as default to reflect historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances higher service for the holiday spike while letting the backend compute risk buffer from historical variance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb) average 32.8 units/week; last period demand was 20. On-hand=0, in-transit=69 (ordered in P1) and P1 conclude showed arrived=0 \u2014 but promised lead time is 2 and we have no concluded arrivals yet, so do NOT infer a lead-time change. Use default promised lead time to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample stats. I select L=default to retain promised L=2, mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures typical weekly demand scaled over review+lead period = 3 weeks), and sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances service (covers ~3 weeks demand) while avoiding overreacting to a single low demand period or a still-in-transit shipment that hasn\u2019t concluded.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=119 (orders from P1/P2 have not concluded). No concluded arrivals observed \u2192 cannot confirm lead-time change; use promised L. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=32.8/week. With promised L=2, use default aggregation to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service (covering 3 weeks demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive periods (P1-P3) where orders were placed but arrived=0 (P1 ordered=69 arrived=0; P2 ordered=50 arrived=0; P3 ordered=1 arrived=0) indicating shipments are delayed or lost versus the promised L=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (some pipeline exists but arrivals not concluding). I therefore raise the assumed lead time to account for delayed arrivals and use recent demand (last 3 concluded demand samples: 20,23,16) to reflect a lower, recent demand regime rather than older Jan samples. Choices: L set explicit to 3 to be conservative about delays; mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 so (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands captures current lower demand; sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering risk given overdue shipments while keeping service level adequate.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive (P1 ordered=69 arrived=0; P2 ordered=50 arrived=0; P3 ordered=1 arrived=0) \u2014 evidence of delayed or lost shipments sustained for 3 periods.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
743098001: ordered=0, arrived=50 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=50, demand=8, sold=8, ending on-hand inventory=42
Daily Profit: $152.00, Daily Holding Cost: $42.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows demand samples (weekly) mean=32.8; latest on-hand=42, in-transit=70. Concluded arrivals show Period2 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=2) while earlier Period1 and Period3 orders did not arrive \u2014 possible partial losses. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times (confirmed 2). For demand I use 'default' (mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to anchor to historical weekly mean scaled by review+lead horizon; sigma_hat='default' to let backend scale observed variability by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using confirmed lead time) against holding cost given available on-hand + in-transit and uncertain missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=32, in-transit=71. History: P1-P3 orders did not arrive (lost/delayed) but P2 order arrival in P4 confirms actual lead time = 2 for observed shipments. I select L=calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). Demand parameters use defaults: mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical weekly samples\u2014this balances service level for the review+lead horizon while keeping estimates robust given limited data and earlier missing shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand 26 + in-transit 76 = 102 units. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 shows P2 order lead_time=2; Period6 shows P5 order lead_time=1 \u2192 use average to reflect mixed evidence (1.5). Recent realized demand has trended down (periods 1-6 demands: 20,23,16,8,10,7), so I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime. These choices balance service (accounting for variable lead time) against holding cost by using a moderate lead-time estimate and demand estimates focused on the most recent 6 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent history: large demand spike in Period 7 (59) exhausted on-hand (ended 0). Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 76. Past concluded lead times show mixed evidence (one arrival with lead_time=2, one with lead_time=1) and multiple earlier missed arrivals. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) using full historical demand\u2014this is conservative given the recent spike and uncertain arrivals, letting the backend produce a capped order that balances service level against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand shows a sharp surge in Periods 7-8 (59, 50) after several low periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=118 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8) \u2014 recent variability suggests using a short recent average. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture current realized lead-time mix. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N N=3 to emphasize the recent high-demand regime while keeping the horizon (1+L) scaling to the OR engine; this raises target base-stock to protect service during the recent spike but uses recent samples to limit excess holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime since Period 7 (demands 59,50,32). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: {P4:2, P6:1, P8:2} \u2192 recent avg ~1.67. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent variability in observed lead times. Demand has a changepoint at Period 7 (sustained 3 periods), so I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to forecast across review+lead using the high-demand regime (Periods 7\u20139). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect increased volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the base-stock upward to protect service during the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: prior avg (P4\u2013P6)=8.33 units, recent avg (P7\u2013P9)=47.0 units (sustained 3 periods)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 7 (P7\u2013P9 avg=47 units); current on-hand=101 + in-transit=70 provides ample coverage vs. elevated demand. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use calculated average lead time to reflect that. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed regime (P7\u2013P9 avg=47). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility in the new regime. These settings aim to keep base stock aligned with the higher demand regime while the OR cap limits excessive ordering and holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=73, in-transit=70 => healthy pipeline but recent volatility. Concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,2,1} (avg 1.6) and earlier carry-over shows demand regime shift at Period 7 (P7\u2013P9 avg=47 over prior ~8). To reflect observed lead-time variability I set L='calculate' (uses average observed lead time). To capture the higher recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the most recent high-demand regime while keeping variance from the same window. This balances service-level (capture recent surge) vs holding cost given current strong on-hand + pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 7 (P7\u2013P12 demands: 59,50,32,25,28,19 \u2014 recent avg elevated vs prior). On-hand=54, in-transit=70 \u2192 pipeline =124 units (ample cover today). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,1} \u2192 variable but cluster around 2; use backend 'calculate' to capture observed average. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=6) to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime (Periods 7\u201312). Volatility is also updated using recent_N (N=6) to reflect higher recent variance. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given proven higher demand while keeping sigma_hat aligned so the OR engine\u2019s capped order respects holding cost tradeoffs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has moderated after the earlier spike: Periods 11\u201313 demands = 28, 19, 33 (avg \u224826.7). On-hand=21, in-transit=97 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,1} (avg \u22481.6). To balance service vs holding cost given sizable pipeline and moderate recent demand, I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so demand forecasts use all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders conservative given existing in-transit inventory and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Demand has recently been elevated and volatile after a confirmed regime shift around Period 7. On-hand=0, in-transit=103. Observed concluded lead times include a mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent sequence: 2,1,2,2,1) \u2014 use a short recent average. For demand, the most relevant recent behavior is the last 4 selling periods (Periods 11\u201314: demand 28,19,33,78 => avg 39.5) which captures the post-changepoint higher demand and elevated variance. I set L using recent_N over the last 5 observed lead-times to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period deliveries; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to target the most recent elevated demand regime and its volatility, giving the OR engine a focused forecast that balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) versus holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=186. Historical concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:2, P10:2, P10:1} (avg ~1.6). Recent demand has jumped sharply: Periods 13\u201315 = [33,78,156]. Given the clear recent regime (3 periods), set L by averaging observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 variability), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 3 demand samples to reflect the new high-demand regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts during spike) vs holding cost by using recent-demand-based forecast while letting OR backend cap orders via its cap formula. Noting past lost/delayed shipments (Periods 1\u20133) but more recent arrivals confirm lead time ~1\u20132.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: prior avg (P10\u2013P12)=24.0, recent avg (P13\u2013P15)=89.0 (+271%)

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=4) to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period 13 (protects service level during spike while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand data). Volatility set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect higher recent variability. This balances profit vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent high mean and elevated sigma while relying on large in-transit pipeline to satisfy near-term demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 13 (P13\u2013P17 demands: 33,78,156,165,153) and observed lead times vary 1\u20132 periods. On-hand (122) + in-transit (230) appear adequate vs. elevated demand but shipments have sometimes arrived with 1 or 2 period lag. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132p behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples P13\u2013P17). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated demand while reflecting observed lead-time variability so the OR engine raises the base-stock without overshooting holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 13 (P13\u2013P18 demands = 33,78,156,165,153,38; recent avg \u2248104) vs earlier lower periods. On-hand=84 and in-transit=396 (total pipeline=480) which already covers multiple periods of elevated demand. Lead-time observations in conclude history show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime (P13\u2013P18) I set demand forecasts using recent_N (N=6). Volatility also uses recent_N (N=6) to capture increased variability. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while acknowledging substantial existing pipeline to avoid excessive additional ordering and holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has been high and volatile (multiple regime shifts previously recorded), but current stock is ample: on-hand=191 + in-transit=237 = 428 units covering several weeks of elevated demand. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (mixed). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times. Given no clear new short-term demand changepoint since Period 16 and large pipeline, I use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs. holding cost while avoiding overreacting to noisy recent spikes.

Concluded history shows observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (mix of 1s and 2s across concluded arrivals); recent arrivals have resumed so no persistent lost-shipment pattern beyond earlier outages. To capture actual lead-time distribution I set L by averaging observed lead times. Demand has documented regime shifts earlier but no new sustained change since Period 16, so use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances high service (high profit vs low holding cost) while reflecting observed lead-time variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand elevated and volatile since the regime shift noted at Period 13; latest 5 concluded demands (Periods 17\u201321 = 153,38,59,57,93) show higher mean and variability than older history. On-hand = 41, in-transit = 237 (sizable pipeline). Use promised lead time (default) to align with OR engine assumptions and avoid over-correcting for past lost shipments. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) set using recent_N N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent variability; this balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been high and volatile since the regime shift at Period 13 (recent avg \u224889 through P15), with continued large weekly demand (P17\u2013P22: 153,38,59,57,93,97). On-hand=0, in-transit=329 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are only visible after conclude; some prior shipments were delayed/lost but lead-time observations since P4 show a mix of 1\u20132 periods. I set L to "calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (captures the post-shift regime from P13 onward and recent volatility) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock target and cap reflect the higher recent mean and variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by relying on recent regime data and existing large pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=328. Recent concluded lead times are mixed but trending ~1\u20132; last 5 observed lead times average \u22481.4 so I use recent_N to reflect shorter recent fulfillment. Demand has risen sharply in prior months; the last 5 demands (Periods 19\u201323) are high (59,57,93,97,108) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and its volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the recent lead-time estimate avoids overstock if shipments continue to arrive faster than promised. No new confirmed lead-time losses since prior insights.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand is high (P22\u2013P24 = 97,108,101) after the sustained regime shift noted earlier; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=328 units. Historical concluded lead times are mixed (mostly 1 or 2); recent observed lead times favor ~1.2. To capture the recent high-demand regime while reflecting short/variable actual lead times, I set L using a recent-average of observed lead times (N=5). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples to reflect the elevated mean and recent volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock while capping order size. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost (holding=$1) by relying on recent demand/lead-time evidence.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 13 (sustained elevated weekly demand; recent 10-period mean ~94). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 (large pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks but some past shipments were delayed/lost \u2014 use lead-time inferred from concluded arrivals). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to let the backend average concluded lead times (~1.33) rather than blindly using promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (periods 16\u201325) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute appropriate base-stock and cap given the inferred lead time and recent demand statistics.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=9, in-transit=309 \u2014 large pipeline covering several weeks of elevated demand. Recent realized lead times vary (1\u20133 periods); last 10 observed avg \u22481.6. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 13; most recent 5-week avg demand \u224891.8 units. To reflect the recent shorter/variable lead-time behavior while being robust to the occasional 3-period arrival, I set L using the recent 5 observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the sustained high-demand regime). These parameters align the OR base-stock toward serving the elevated recent demand while accounting for current pipeline and limiting excess holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand remains high (Period25\u201327 demands = 71, 82, 105; recent 3-pt mean = 86). On-hand=0, in-transit=307 (covers multiple outstanding orders but arrivals are delayed/variable historically). Observed concluded lead times (latest 3 observed = 1,3,2 \u2192 avg 2.0) and prior evidence of inconsistent deliveries motivate using a short recent window for L. I set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the current effective lead time. I set mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect the elevated recent demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during a sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability and an empirically estimated lead time.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been high and volatile (periods 13\u201328 average surged vs prior); on-hand=0, in-transit=308 (large pipeline). Many recent arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) so I use a recent average lead time. I set L by averaging the last 9 observed lead times to capture recent variability. For demand I use the recent demand regime (periods 13\u201328, regime length=16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=16 to reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand while keeping sigma to reflect higher uncertainty and avoid excessive overstock given holding cost.

Recent demand has been high and volatile (last 5 demands: 82,105,137,123, ? \u2014 overall recent periods show sustained elevated demand since Period 13). Observed lead times have varied; use calculated average of all observed lead times to let the backend infer typical lag. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine raises target base-stock while limiting overreaction to older low-demand periods. This balances service (high profit relative to holding cost) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=402. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed values across concluded arrivals average \u22481.77), and demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 13 (recent weeks P27\u2013P30: 105,137,123,132; many earlier weeks also high). To reflect the empirically shorter-than-promised lead time I set L via 'calculate' (uses average of all observed lead times). To capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (regime length from P13\u2192P30 \u224818 weeks) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, improving service with recent demand while limiting holding cost given strong in-transit positions.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=411. Historical concluded lead-times vary (recent observed sequence includes 1,1,3,2,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482). Demand has stayed high since the regime shift at Period 13; recent 5-week demand = [105,137,123,132,95], mean\u2248118.4. To reflect recent lead-time variability I use recent_N (N=6) for L (captures the last 6 observed lead-times, avg\u22482). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the high recent demand regime (uses last 5 weekly samples). Volatility is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the OR backend base-stock responsive to the sustained high demand while using a lead-time estimate informed by recent mixed delays (mitigates stockouts from occasional 3-period delays).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been high and volatile since the regime shift recorded at Period 13 (sustained high demand through Periods 13\u201332). On-hand=0, in-transit=402 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals may still be noisy (historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20133). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the variable/shifted lead-time behavior). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (N=20 balances recency with sample size given the sustained high-demand period). This biases orders to meet the elevated demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility, and avoids overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent weekly demand has been high and volatile since the regime shift detected at Period 13 (sustained higher mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=402 \u2014 large pipeline but past shipments show variable lead times and occasional lost/delayed shipments. I set L=calculate to let the backend infer average realized lead time from concluded arrivals (promised=2 but history shows variability). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 20 samples to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (P14\u2013P33 window) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while the backend cap limits extreme orders; using recent data reduces risk of understock given observed sustained higher demand and the uncertain arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 406. Historical concludes show variable and sometimes delayed lead times (observed lead times include 1\u20133 periods, with some missing arrivals earlier), and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (recent weeks much larger than early periods). To hedge demand and uncertain delivery, set lead time to the calculated average of observed lead times so backend uses empirical lead-time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (stable high-demand from P13 onward) with N=20 to capture recent mean/volatility while smoothing noise. This increases target base stock to cover higher demand and delivery uncertainty, balancing profit vs. holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=407 \u2014 large pipeline but many prior shipments showed variable lead times (observed 1\u20133). Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (recent weeks demand ~63\u2013137). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability 1\u20133). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime starting P13 and to make base-stock responsive to current elevated demand. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=20 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices balance service (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost given large pipeline and variable lead times.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weeks show elevated, volatile demand versus early-year low baseline; on-hand=0, in-transit=406 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with evidence of lost shipments earlier, so rely on observed lead-time average. Use recent demand window to reflect sustained higher-demand regime (shift at Period 13). L: compute average of observed lead times to capture true supplier behavior. mu_hat: recent_N using last 20 demand observations to center forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit position limits aggressive ordering and helps control holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Product is a fashion necklace with sustained high recent demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=406 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary but earlier carry-over confirmed lead_time=2; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (recent weekly demands large and volatile); use recent_N with N=5 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the 5 most recent demand observations so the base-stock reflects the current high-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. The large in-transit quantity plus recent_N forecasting balances service level vs holding cost by relying on observed pipeline and recent demand to avoid excess new orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical log shows sustained demand regime increase since Period 13 (recent weeks average ~80\u201390 units). Promised lead time=2 and past concluded lead-times vary but 2-periods remains valid; no new sustained lead-time change observed. To ensure higher service during this high-demand regime while capping orders per OR engine, use promised lead time (default) for L, and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on recent demand to reflect the elevated regime. I choose recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand periods show avg \u224880 units) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture current volatility. This raises the backend target inventory to meet elevated demand while the cap limits excessive ordering and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) and some lost/delayed shipments; demand has been in a higher regime since Period 13. To capture actual lead-time variability use calculate (avg observed LT). To bias demand forecast toward the recent high-demand regime use recent_N with N=20 (focus on the last 20 demand observations). Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to ensure pipeline + orders cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while keeping safety stock aligned with recent variability.

Recent history (many weeks of high weekly demand in late summer\u2013fall) and prior confirmed lead time=2 make using the promised lead time reasonable. I set L to default (promised 2). To capture the sustained high-demand regime since mid\u20102019 I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=20 (places weight on recent weeks). I leave sigma_hat at default to reflect overall observed variability. This balances higher target inventory for service with holding cost awareness given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent weekly demand (P37\u2013P41) = [89,77,65,54,68], avg \u2248 70.6 \u2014 demand has been materially higher than early-year samples and shows a recent moderate downward drift from midsummer peaks but is still elevated. On-hand=0, in-transit=406 (large pipeline) so orders already outstanding likely cover several weeks; earlier periods showed both lost/delayed shipments but recent conclues confirm typical lead times around 1\u20133. To respond to the recent demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost given large pipeline, use a short recent-window forecast (adaptive) and match sigma to recent variability.

History shows variable lead times (1\u20133) and occasional lost/delayed shipments earlier; recent concluded arrivals indicate lead time variability. I choose L by 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead-time history rather than the promised default. Demand has been in a more stable, elevated regime recently (recent weeks ~63\u201377 units); to capture current demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demand samples). These settings aim to size base stock to meet current demand while reflecting recent variability and avoid overreacting to older lost-shipment noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=406 \u2014 large pipeline from prior orders. Historical concluded lead times show variability but promised lead time remains 2; recent concluded evidence (Period 4 and Period 17 etc.) supports using promised lead time for the OR engine. Demand history is noisy with earlier regime shifts but no new 3+ period sustained change since Period 16 entry; therefore use defaults so backend uses full-sample statistics. This keeps the backend\u2019s base-stock calibrated to long-run mean while capping orders via its cap formula; using defaults avoids overreacting to transient spikes and leverages the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess holding cost.

Recent concluded history shows no new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes since the prior recorded shifts (lead time confirmed=2 at P5; demand regime shifts at P7 and P13). Large in-transit suggests outstanding pipeline will cover upcoming demand; nevertheless concluded messages show no new arrivals recently so avoid aggressive changes. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats (default) so the OR backend computes base stock from all historical samples and the promised L, balancing service level vs holding cost given high pipeline volume.

Promised lead time is 2 periods; recent concluded history confirms occasional variability but no new sustained lead-time change since prior insights. Large in-transit balance (406) suggests sufficient pipeline to cover (1+L) demand; avoid increasing target stock to limit holding cost during holiday week. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service level given heavy pipeline against $1/unit holding cost and $19 profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent weeks show sustained customer demand (many nonzero weekly demands) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=406. Historical concluded lead-times are variable but earlier evidence (Period 4\u20135) confirmed a 2-period lead time; no new sustained lead-time change is convincingly observed. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised commitments and its assumptions, use the default promised lead time and default demand estimates (which use all samples) so the backend computes base_stock from the full historical mean/variance. This leverages the large in-transit pipeline while avoiding overfitting to recent noise; defaults balance service-level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.
