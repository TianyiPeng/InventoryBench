Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand samples (weekly): 47,63,69,60,61 (mean ~60). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time issues. Promised lead time is 2 and no evidence to override. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=74 (ordered P1). No concluded arrivals yet; cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand mean=60 (samples: 47,63,69,60,61). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps policy aligned with historical baseline while awaiting arrival confirmation or lead-time evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (matches orders 74+75). No concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 2. Use default lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Demand history (47,63,69,60,61) mean=60; use all-sample defaults so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock tied to historical weekly demand while avoiding overreaction to possible delayed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan) have mean=60 units/week. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=168 (orders placed in Periods 1-3) but no arrivals recorded in conclude messages for those orders. Orders placed in Period 1 would have been expected to arrive by Period 3 if promised L=2, yet arrived=0 for P1\u2013P3 orders, indicating actual lead time is longer than promised or shipments delayed. To protect service I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures full-sample demand and scales safety stock for longer review+lead period). This increases order quantities to cover the longer effective pipeline while sigma scaling preserves safety stock vs holding cost tradeoff given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained arrival failures: orders from Periods 1\u20133 (total ordered 168) have arrived=0 in concludes; suggests actual lead time \u22653 periods (in-transit=168, on-hand=0).

=== Period 4 Summary ===
536139010: ordered=59, arrived=75 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=75, demand=60, sold=60, ending on-hand inventory=15
Daily Profit: $60.00, Daily Holding Cost: $15.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concludes show one confirmed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Multiple earlier orders were delayed but Period2 arrival matches promised lead time. On-hand=15, in-transit=152 (some orders from P1\u2013P3 remain in-transit). Given single confirmed LT observation and no sustained evidence of a longer LT, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 2). Demand history (samples mean = 60) and (1+L)=3 motivate using default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (protect against 3-period coverage) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand samples avg \u2248 60 (historic five samples: 47,63,69,60,61). On-hand=0, in-transit=156 (some earlier orders still in pipeline). Concluded arrivals show at least one order had lead_time=2 (order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4), so actual lead time appears consistent with promised L=2; use backend's lead-time estimator to average observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility methods so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost and limited on-hand stock. This maintains a conservative base-stock while letting the OR engine cap orders based on its cap formula and observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order placed Period 2 arrived in Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed W=2 for P2->P4 and W=1 for P5->P6) and large in-transit (166) with on-hand 0; some earlier arrivals were delayed but later concluded, so use observed-average lead time to let backend adapt. Use 'calculate' for L to average observed lead times. Demand history (weekly samples mean \u224860) is stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This keeps orders conservative while the in-transit pipeline is monitored for lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=166. Recent demand history shows sustained weekly demand ~47\u201369 from historical samples and recent realized demands (periods 4\u20137) of 60,53,33,43 \u2014 demand remains elevated. Concluded arrivals give observed lead times of 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6); earlier multi-period non-arrivals suggest some lost shipments but more recent evidence supports a shorter realized lead time. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR engine adapt to recent variability. For demand forecast and volatility I'll use the backend defaults (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to leverage the full historical sample set while letting L reflect recent lead-time behavior. This balances service-level (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P2->P4:2, P5->P6:1, P6->P8:2} \u2192 average \u22481.67. On-hand=0, in-transit=152 (some earlier orders outstanding). Demand samples historical mean = 60. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while letting L adjust the review+lead period. This balances service level (captures modestly elevated lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding, avoiding explicit overstocking despite in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent realized demand per period is roughly 40\u201365 units (historical samples and recent periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (large pipeline from prior orders). Concluded history shows actual lead times centered on 2 periods (Period 2\u21924, Period 6\u21928), so promised lead time=2 is consistent. No sustained demand regime shift detected. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full historical sample statistics, I select default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Concluded history shows mixed observed lead times: recent observed W sequence = [2 (P4),1 (P6),2 (P8),1 (P10)] => average 1.5. To reflect this recent variability I set L=recent_N (N=4) so the OR engine uses the recent average lead time. Demand history (seed samples 47,63,69,60,61 and subsequent period demands) shows no clear sustained regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples). This balances service (capturing elevated demand samples) vs holding cost by letting the backend compute base stock with the recent lead-time estimate while keeping demand priors broad.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=156. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2 (P2->P4),1 (P5->P6),2 (P6->P8),1 (P9->P10)] \u2192 recent average \u22481.5. Recent demand (Periods 7\u201311) = [43,49,43,42,39], mean \u224843.2. I set L to recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest observed lead-time mix rather than blindly using promised 2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to forecast over the review+lead horizon using the most recent demand regime (stable ~43 units/week). This balances service (capture recent demand level) with holding cost (avoid inflating demand with older higher samples) given profit=holding cost symmetry.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=156. Historical concludes show mixed arrivals but lead time was confirmed as 2 periods (Period 6 evidence) and recent arrivals are intermittent; no new sustained changepoint. To avoid overfitting to transient missed shipments, use promised/default lead time and full-sample demand statistics so the OR engine computes base-stock from the long-run mean/variance. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand while letting the backend cap limit extreme orders given uncertainty.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} \u2192 average \u22481.6. Use calculate for L so backend uses observed average lead time; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so forecasts reflect full historical demand and scale with chosen L.

Demand samples (historic weeks) show mean ~60 (given samples 47,63,69,60,61). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend use avg ~1.6) to reflect mixed/unstable arrivals while remaining data-driven. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (leveraging full history). This balances service (capture higher mean demand) versus holding cost given holding=profit, and lets the OR backend apply its capped policy given the inferred lead time and full-sample demand stats.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=154. Historical concluded lead times show recurring 2-period arrivals (several orders: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13) so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been variable with a modest uptick; to capture the latest regime I use a recent-N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean and volatility over the most recent weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from recent demand rather than the long-run mean.

Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] (avg 1.6). To capture the empirical lead-time behavior while letting the backend use its averaging, set L via calculate. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (captures recent mean \u224851 and recent volatility) so the OR engine sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand and accounts for recent variance.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with confirmation at Period 6 of lead_time=2; some earlier delayed/lost arrivals occurred but recent concluded messages are consistent with promised 2-period behavior. I use default promised lead time to let the OR engine assume L=2. Demand history sample mean (~60) will be scaled by (1+L) by the backend, so I keep mu_hat default to reflect all samples and avoid overfitting to recent noise. Volatility will use default as well. This balances service (covering (L+1) periods) against holding cost given profit=holding, and lets the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using full-sample statistics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical concluded lead times (periods with arrived>0) = [2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg\u22481.67) \u2014 recent observations show mostly 2-period arrivals with occasional 1-periods. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) = [69,55,45,38,36], indicating a higher recent mean than the long-run sample mean. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to recent average (capture short-term actual lead behavior) and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (focus orders on the recent higher-demand regime). These choices help the OR backend size base stock to cover the review+lead demand under the most recent demand and lead-time conditions while avoiding overcommitment to older low-demand data. In-transit=152 flags many prior orders; methods above rely on observed concluded lead times only per rules.

Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2 periods (confirmed in Period 6) with occasional 1-period arrivals and some earlier lost shipments; no new sustained lead-time shift since last confirmation. Demand history (many weeks of ~33\u201369; early samples mean ~60) implies steady moderate weekly demand. I choose the promised/default lead time to let the OR engine use its observed lead-time stats, and default demand/volatility estimators so the backend computes base_stock using all available samples. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of typical demand while letting the OR cap guard against over-ordering given pipeline=152.

On-hand=0, in-transit=152 (large pipeline). Historical weekly samples (provided) have mean \u224860; profit and holding cost are equal, so no bias toward over/under stock. I choose default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the promised lead time and full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This lets the backend compute the appropriate base-stock while accounting for the large existing pipeline and equal profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has fallen materially versus earlier history: last 5 periods (P17\u2013P21) avg demand \u224829.2 units/week vs earlier average \u224848.1. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=152 (sizable pipeline). Promised lead time=2; historical concluded arrivals show lead time behavior around 1\u20132, so use promised lead time. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for pipeline, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5-week lower demand pattern). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit here), while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent demand volatility. L uses default (promised lead time=2) so backend aligns ordering timing with supplier promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 17\u201321): avg demand decreased from ~48.1 (Periods 1\u201316) to ~29.2 (Periods 17\u201321), a ~39% drop.

Demand has stepped down starting Period 17 (Periods 17\u201321 avg ~29.2 vs prior ~48); I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the new lower regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps stock aligned to the confirmed lower demand while letting the OR engine set service level vs holding cost using observed lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 17 (avg down ~39%); on-hand=0, in-transit=152 (some prior orders may be delayed/lost). Use observed lead-time evidence rather than promised: set L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, target the recent low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201323) so set mu_hat recent_N with N=7 (captures the low-demand regime length). Match sigma_hat to recent variability in that same window (recent_N N=7). This reduces overstock risk given lower demand while keeping enough pipeline cover for the (calculated) lead time and the review period.

Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical concludes confirm a sustained demand regime shift down beginning Period 17 (Periods 17\u201321 avg ~29.2 vs Periods 1\u201316 ~48.1). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 in concludes; promised lead time is 2. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised=2) and use recent_N for demand parameters using the recent 5-period regime (N=5) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and updated volatility over the new regime. This balances avoiding overstock given holding cost equal to profit while preserving service with the observed lower demand and existing large in-transit pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weeks (Periods 17\u201325) show the lower-demand regime (~28\u201329 wkly) confirmed earlier; current on-hand=0, in-transit=152. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg ~1.67) so I use calculated average lead time to reflect realized behavior rather than the promised 2. I set mu_hat using a recent_N window covering the recent low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201325, length=9) so the OR base-stock reflects the lower mean; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to capture recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to the lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking given holding cost = profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12): on-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical concludes show a sustained demand drop starting Period 17 (avg ~29.2) vs earlier (~48.1). Recent arrivals sparse but lead-time confirmations earlier were 1\u20132; promised lead time is 2 so use default L. To capture the confirmed lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 17\u201326 \u2192 N=10) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the lowered mean/variance. This keeps orders lean given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1) and large in-transit volume that may be delayed or lost.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical concluded lead_times = {2,1,2,1,2,2} (avg \u22481.67) so use calculate to let backend infer avg observed LT. Demand regime dropped around Periods 17\u201321 (avg down ~39%); to reflect recent lower demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on latest 5 demand observations) so the OR engine reduces target base_stock and volatility, lowering holding cost while preserving service. In-transit stock (152) likely covers the near-term (L+1) demand, so this conservative recent-based forecast avoids over-ordering if shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. Historical sample set shows a sustained demand drop confirmed Periods 17\u201321; recent weeks (Periods 24\u201328) are more variable with a higher mean than the mid-regime dip. Many prior orders experienced delayed arrivals but lead-time observations exist (mixed 1\u20132). I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals) to reflect actual behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the latest 5 demand samples (captures recent variability and avoids stale early high-demand weeks). This balances service (accounting for current in-transit + recent demand) vs. holding cost by focusing forecast on recent regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning around Periods 17\u201321, but the most recent five weeks (Periods 25\u201329: 26,25,59,53,30) show higher variability and a higher short-term mean. On-hand=0 and in-transit=152 (outstanding pipeline) \u2014 some past shipments were delayed but lead time was confirmed as 2 in prior concludes; therefore keep L at the promised/default to align with supplier promise. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest demand level and volatility over the most recent 5 weeks so the OR engine targets service for current demand while capping orders against the pipeline. No new sustained changepoint detected to add to carry-over.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=152. History shows sporadic arrival failures early but lead time was later observed as 2 periods; demand regime drop was noted around Periods 17\u201321 but recent weeks (Periods 22\u201330) show variable demand. Given confirmed promised lead time=2 and no new sustained changepoint, use default calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps parameters robust to noise, lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost, and avoids overreacting to possibly transient fluctuations while accounting for the promised 2-period lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=152 \u2014 significant pipeline exists from prior orders. Historical concludes show actual lead time has oscillated but was confirmed as 2 periods previously; no new sustained lead-time evidence. Demand has a confirmed downshift around Periods 17\u201321, but recent weeks (Periods 27\u201331) show higher volatility and a higher recent mean. To balance service vs holding cost I use the promised/default lead time and set demand parameters from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime and volatility (short lookback to react to recent spikes). These settings keep orders responsive to recent demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=159. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2 and 1 periods (avg ~1.67) but prior carry-over flagged a confirmed regime drop around Periods 17\u201321 and recent demand (Periods 27\u201332) has rebounded. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times (lets backend infer ~1.67) and use recent demand (last 6 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent uptick rather than older low-demand regime. This reduces overstocking from older high pipeline while restoring enough cover for recent higher demand.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has spiked (last 5 weeks: 30,59,63,66,113; mean\u224866) so use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the recent surge while using observed lead-time average to avoid systematic under/over-ordering given past variable arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=199. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with several earlier prolonged arrival failures now resolved; promised lead time remains 2. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201334 = 63,66,113,67) shows a sharp uptick vs prior low regime (Periods 17\u201330). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost given profit=holding, I use promised lead time (default) and a recent-window demand estimate to capture the recent spike. I choose recent_N with N=5 to let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean over the last 5 demand samples (captures the most recent regime) and recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher target stock for service against holding cost given uncertain arrivals/in-transit balance.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14): on-hand=0, in-transit=214. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W values: 2,1,2,1,2,2,3, ...), indicating inconsistent fulfillment and occasional long delays; demand has shifted historically but recent history includes high weekly spikes (e.g., P33 demand=113, P35 demand=71). To let the OR engine internal forecast use all available demand data while accounting for variable lead time, set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) so the backend infers realized lead time from concluded arrivals; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This balances service level (by capturing realized lead-time variability) against holding cost while acknowledging large in-transit stock (214) already covers several review+lead periods.

Recent concluded lead times are variable; last observed lead times (most recent 5) = [1,3,3,2,2] => average ~2.2, so use recent_N for L to reflect realized variability above promised 2. Recent demand (Periods 32\u201336) shows a higher regime (demands = [66,113,67,71,69], mean \u224877.2) so use recent_N for mu_hat to capture current elevated demand. Demand volatility is also elevated (large spike 113) so use recent_N for sigma_hat over the same window. These choices align pipeline coverage to (1+L) periods of the most recent demand regime and increase safety stock to guard against observed high variance while avoiding overcommitting to older low-demand periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has rebounded strongly vs the mid-year low (recent demands P33-P37 = 113,67,71,69,70). On-hand=0, in-transit=232 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (historic observed: 2,1,2,1,2,2,3,3,1) -> average \u22481.89. To capture the recent higher demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5, covering P33\u2013P37) and infer lead time from observed concluded lead times (calculate). This balances service (higher mu_hat to meet current elevated weekly demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, In-transit=188. History shows variable but mostly short lead times (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,1,2,2,3,3,1,1 \u2192 avg 1.8). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand history is noisy with a confirmed downward regime earlier; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, yielding a conservative base-stock that balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=188. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average ~1.8 periods with recent variability (1\u20133). A previously recorded demand drop around Periods 17\u201321 remains the last sustained regime shift; no new sustained demand or lead-time shifts detected in the most recent concludes. I therefore let the backend compute lead time from observed concludes (calculate) so it captures the ~1.8 average, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full sample history ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) for stable baseline forecasting. This balances service (by acknowledging slightly <2 average lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding, and leverages the OR engine's capped ordering policy while accounting for large in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=188. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) including several 3-period arrivals since Period 32; use observed lead-time data rather than promised. Demand shows a clear upward regime starting at Period 32 (sustained higher weekly demand). I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=8, most recent 8 demand samples) to capture the post-Period-32 higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This gives the OR engine a demand forecast reflecting the new higher mean and volatility while L calculated from observed leads reconciles late/3-period arrivals; together these balance service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and recent high demand) vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg increased from ~29.2 (Periods 17\u201321) to ~77.2 (Periods 32\u201336), +164% (sustained high demand P32\u2013P40).

No new concluded arrivals since Period 41, so no confirmed permanent lead-time change. Use promised lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned, but base demand estimate on the recent high-demand regime (last 9 periods, P32\u2013P40) to cover review+lead demand. Setting sigma to recent_N (same 9) captures recent volatility during this high-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 32 (P32\u2013P40 avg \u224877.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=206 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 but observed lead times have varied; recent concludes show arrivals with 1\u20133 periods so use default promised lead time to let OR engine assume L=2. Set mu_hat using recent high-demand regime to capture current elevated demand: use recent_N with N=9 (samples from the sustained high-demand window) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean over last 9 samples. Match sigma_hat to recent volatility with recent_N N=9. These choices prioritize meeting high recent demand while the large in-transit stock reduces immediate stockout risk; using recent_N focuses safety stock on the current regime and keeps holding cost in check.

Recent concluded arrivals (most recently P43: order P41 arrived with lead_time=2) indicate actual lead time around 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts since prior carry-over insights. I will use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses its historical-demand estimate, and keep default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. The large in-transit quantity is noted and will be reconciled by the OR engine against the pipeline when sizing orders.

Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed avg ~1.82) but promised=2; demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 32 (P32\u2013P44, 13 periods) so forecast should use recent high-demand samples. Choose L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (~1.8). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (covers P32\u2013P44) so base-stock and safety stock reflect current elevated mean and volatility while capping orders via the OR cap.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=240. Recent concluded arrivals show typical actual lead time \u22482 (recent arrivals: P45:2, P43:2, P38:1, P36:1,3, P35:3 \u2192 avg \u22482). Demand has been in the elevated regime since P32 (sustained high demand through P45). To cover review+lead demand while reflecting the sustained high-demand regime and recent stable lead time, I set L via calculate (average observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 14 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (higher mu_hat for the elevated regime) against holding cost given profit=holding, while leveraging recent volatility for safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=252. Recent concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); several recent confirms of 2-period arrivals (e.g., P41\u2192P43, P43\u2192P45). Demand has jumped in late periods (Periods 42\u201346 = 175,132,131,72,53) reflecting holiday/high season. To balance service vs holding cost, set L to the computed average of observed lead times so the OR engine internal L matches empirical behavior. Use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime in the last five weeks and its volatility while avoiding dilution by older low-demand history.
