  "rationale": "Observed facts: promised LT=2 is confirmed by earlier concluded arrivals (carry-over). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=450. Historical weekly mean from samples \u224860 units; (L+1)=3 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248180 units over coverage horizon. In-transit (450) comfortably exceeds expected demand even if some in-transit units are delayed; ordering now would create extra holding cost equal to profit ($1) so increasing inventory reduces objective. OR recommended 0; given sufficient pipeline to cover (L+1) periods and high holding cost, I place no order to avoid unnecessary holding costs. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime signals warranting override were observed.",
