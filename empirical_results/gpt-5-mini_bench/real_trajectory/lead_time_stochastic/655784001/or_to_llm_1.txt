Given the pipeline of 306 may never arrive, but uncertainty is high, I avoid fully trusting the in-transit number and avoid creating excess holding cost if those in-transit units do eventually arrive.

I choose a compromise order of 150 units: with on-hand 10 this plus expected (unreliable) arrivals covers most near-term demand while limiting overstock risk if the demand remains lower or lost shipments reappear. This reduces over-ordering relative to naive base-stock while keeping service high given the high profit margin.",
