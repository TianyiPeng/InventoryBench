Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly cadence). Recent weekly demand samples: [22,11,20,13,41] (mean=21.4, std\u224810.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. Promised lead time=2 has no observed deviations. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given limited data and no confirmed regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand 0, in-transit 41 (order placed P1 showed arrived=0 in P1 conclude \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time yet). Promised lead time retained. Use default lead time so backend treats L=promised (2). Demand history mean ~21.4/week; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) provides a neutral baseline that covers (L+1) periods of demand while the missing arrival is monitored; this balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost until lead-time is confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent history: two orders (41 in P1, 60 in P2) have not concluded yet (arrived=0 in conclude messages) and on-hand=0, in-transit=101. Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean\u224821.4. I am conservative: do not yet conclude lead-time change (need \u22653 periods evidence) so keep promised lead time. Use default demand estimates so backend uses full sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps forecasting grounded in historical data while the sizable in-transit (101 units) already covers (1+L)\xd7mean, avoiding aggressive extra ordering while we wait for arrival confirmations. Carry-over notes: none (insufficient sustained evidence of a lead-time or demand regime shift).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=178 (orders 41,60,77 from P1\u2013P3). No arrivals concluded for those orders (Period1\u20133 concludes show arrived=0) which strongly suggests actual lead time is longer than promised 2 or shipments are delayed/lost. To be conservative I set L explicitly longer to cover delayed arrivals so the backend sizes reorder targets knowing we need more pipeline coverage. Demand history mean \u224821.4/week; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (they scale with chosen L) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std automatically. This balances higher target stock to avoid lost-sales while keeping holding cost considered by the backend's service-level formula.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (41, 60, 77 units) have not arrived by Period 3 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 suggests actual lead time >2 or missing shipments; treat as sustained delay until arrivals confirmed.

Daily Profit: $1140.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1140.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has risen: last 4 weekly demands = 60, 77, 98, 89 (upward trend). On-hand=0, in-transit=215 (includes multiple outstanding orders; arrivals show at least one order had lead_time=2 but some earlier orders were delayed). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time data (we have a confirmed 2-period arrival) rather than the default promised value, capturing measured lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to base mu_hat on the most recent regime reflecting the upward demand trend. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to capture recent demand variability. These settings bias orders toward the recent higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead time and recent variability, addressing overdue shipments by relying on measured lead-time and recent demand rather than long-ago samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent observed demands (Periods1-5) are high and volatile: [60,77,98,89,50]; historical older samples are much lower and less relevant. One confirmed observed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Several orders (Periods1,3,5) experienced delays/missing arrivals; treat delay as persistent risk but evidence does not contradict lead time=2. I set L=calculate to anchor on observed lead times (avg=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime across the last 5 periods; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap to limit overshoot given in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent demand has been much higher than the older 2019-Jan samples (most recent 6 demands: 60,77,98,89,50,42; mean\u224869.3) and arrivals show variable lead time (observed lead_times: 2,1). On-hand=33 + in-transit=215 provides sizable pipeline but earlier periods 1\u20133 shipments were delayed; recent arrivals (Period4 and Period6) show lead time variability rather than consistent 2. I choose L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variability without overcommitting to promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the last 6 observed demands). For sigma I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while using observed lead-time average to avoid overordering if lead time shortens; using recent std keeps safety stock aligned with recent variability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has stepped up vs the sparse 2019-Jan samples (recent period demands: 60,77,98,89,50,42,70) and pipeline shows 239 in-transit with on-hand=0; some prior orders were delayed but we have two concluded lead times (1 and 2). To reflect the most recent realized lead-time behavior I use recent_N for L (average of last 2 observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises base stock while controlling volatility estimates. This balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost given elevated recent demand and uncertain arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. Recent realized weekly demand (periods 4\u20138) is elevated vs. Jan samples (demands: 89,50,42,70,75). On-hand=0, in-transit=255 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 arrival (ordered P2) = 2, P6 arrival (ordered P5)=1, P8 arrival (ordered P7)=1 \u2192 evidence of a shorter-than-promised average lead time with variability. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 outcomes). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the last 5 realized demands (captures the current higher-demand regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet near-term demand while using recent variability to limit excess holding given the large in-transit pipeline and some delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: P4 (ordered P2) = 2; P6 (ordered P5) = 1; P8 (ordered P7) = 1 \u2192 average lead time \u22481.33 periods (based on 3 concluded arrivals).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=255 => substantial pipeline but recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times shorter than promised (observed LT samples: 2,1,1). Some earlier orders were delayed but recent arrivals indicate avg LT \u22481.33. Demand history shows elevated recent weekly demand (periods 5\u20139: 50,42,70,75,52). I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the average of the three most recent observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the latest five demand observations, capturing the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples. This balances higher service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost by targeting a demand-driven base stock with recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=215. Historical concluded lead times: P4 (ordered P2)=2, P6 (P5)=1, P8 (P7)=1, P10 (P8)=2 \u2192 observed lead-time avg=1.5. Demand since Period1 is clearly higher than the early 2019 sample set (recent concluded demands: 60,77,98,89,50,42,70,75,52,64); this represents a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (let backend average concluded observations). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 concluded demand observations, which captures the sustained higher demand while allowing the OR engine to compute service-level stock given profit/holding tradeoff. This also accounts for the large in-transit volume when computing pipeline coverage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as ~1.5 periods (observed: P4 ordered P2 -> 2; P6 ordered P5 -> 1; P8 ordered P7 -> 1; P10 ordered P8 -> 2).

Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=254. Historical concluded lead times: P4(order P2)=2, P6(order P5)=1, P8(order P7)=1, P10(order P8)=2 \u2192 recent average \u22481.5. Several earlier orders were delayed (Periods 1\u20133 arrivals missing) but recent arrivals show lead time fluctuating around 1\u20132. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures ~1.5). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand mean/std are scaled by (1+L) determined by calculated L; this balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost while accounting for pipeline (in-transit=254).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand has been much higher than the January samples (recent 5-period demands \u2248 75,52,64,57,91; mean \u224867.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=254 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times (most recent 4 observed: 2,1,1,2) average \u22481.5 \u2014 I use a recent-average estimate to reflect faster arrivals than the promised 2 but still variable. Set L using recent_N (N=4) to capture the last 4 observed lead-times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime (covers review+lead demand). These choices push the OR engine to target a base stock appropriate for the elevated recent demand while recognizing a shorter effective lead time, helping balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been elevated vs the early-sample history (recent 5 concluded demands = 52,64,57,91,81 \u2192 avg 69). On-hand=0, in-transit=215 (covers multiple periods). Observed concluded lead times: P4(P2)=2, P6(P5)=1, P8(P7)=1, P10(P8)=2, P13(P11)=2 \u2192 recent average \u22481.6. Use calculated L to let backend infer average observed lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current higher-demand regime. This balances higher service level (larger base_stock via recent mean) against holding cost by keeping variance estimate recent so cap limits order size when uncertainty is elevated.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as ~1.6 periods (observed lead_times: 2,1,1,2,2 across concluded arrivals P4,P6,P8,P10,P13); earlier sustained delays (Periods1-3 orders not arriving by P3 conclude) persisted but recent concluded arrivals are consistently 1\u20132 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled higher: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [64,57,91,81,89], avg\u224876.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=254 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (most recent) are 2,1,1,2,2 \u2192 average \u22481.6; recent arrivals are consistently 1\u20132 periods. To reflect observed lead time variability and recent higher demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime and volatility. This provides the OR engine a demand forecast tuned to the current higher-demand regime while letting backend compute base-stock and cap using observed lead-time statistics and recent volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {2,1,1,2,2} \u2192 avg \u22481.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=273 (large pipeline). Use L='calculate' to let backend set L to the average observed lead time (captures recent 1\u20132 period reality). Demand has stepped up recently (most recent 5 demands: 57,91,81,89,83; avg \u224880.2) so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the latest regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while the large in-transit inventory limits new ordering via the OR cap, mitigating holding cost risk and addressing prior delayed arrivals evidence.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

To reflect the empirically shorter-than-promised but variable lead time, set L via calculate (uses observed average). Demand has been high and stable recently (last 5 period demands avg \u224888.4); use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base-stock on the current higher-demand regime and observed volatility. This balances service (capture current demand spike) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand is elevated vs. the historical 2019-Jan samples: last 6 concluded demands = [91,81,89,83,98,67] (avg ~84.8/week). Pipeline is large (on-hand 0, in-transit 259) but past history shows variable lead times of 1\u20132 periods with a recent average ~1.6. I set lead-time using a recent average of the last 5 observed lead-times to emphasize the most recent 1\u20132 period behaviour while being robust to earlier long delays. For demand I use the last 6 weeks (recent_N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime; same window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet high short-term demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering; using recent samples helps the OR engine adjust \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 for the current elevated regime and the recent 1\u20132 period lead-time pattern.

I set L using recent lead-time observations to reflect current ~1.6-period reality so the OR backend sizes review+lead accordingly. Demand has been elevated recently (last 5 demands: 89,83,98,67,68); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts and uncertainty reflect the current higher-demand regime and short lead-time variability, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than the long-run mean.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=259 \u2014 pipeline is large but recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times mostly 1\u20132 periods (historical concluded lead_times: 2,1,1,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.6). Use calculate for L so backend explicitly estimates observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples; this leverages full sample history while letting L reflect recent 1\u20132 period reality. This balances service (high pipeline + shorter inferred L \u2192 lower base_stock) against holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=290. Historical concluded lead times cluster 1\u20132 periods (11 concluded samples; mean \u22481.55). Recent demand has risen (Periods 20\u201324 demands = 119,122,81,92,145; recent mean \u2248111.8). There remain earlier prolonged delays for Periods1\u20133 orders but recent concluded arrivals are consistently 1\u20132 periods, so I set L using a recent-average of observed lead times to reflect the shorter effective lead time while keeping memory of variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand periods to capture the recent elevated demand and volatility. These choices give the OR backend a lead-time estimate close to recent reality (reducing excessive pipeline padding) while scaling expected demand and uncertainty to recent higher sales, balancing service level (profit-driven high fill rate given profit/holding implies high z) against holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=409 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible on-hand stock today. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods with recent average \u22481.6; earlier sustained delays (Periods1\u20133) persisted but recent concluded arrivals are consistently 1\u20132. Demand has shifted upward in recent weeks (several weeks of 100+ demand including 119,122,145,129). To reflect recent realized lead times I use a recent average for L; to capture the elevated recent demand and volatility I use recent_N demand estimates over the last 10 periods so the OR backend's base-stock balances higher target service (profit >> holding cost) against holding costs. Methods chosen: L = recent_N (short recent lead-time evidence), mu_hat = recent_N (captures recent high-demand regime), sigma_hat = recent_N (captures recent volatility).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical concluded lead_times across recent arrivals are consistently 1\u20132 periods (recent sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2...), indicating actual lead time \u22481.6 but fluctuating around 1\u20132. Demand has risen in recent weeks; last 5 demands = [81,92,145,129,97] (mean \u2248108.8). To reflect the recent stable short lead-time regime and elevated recent demand, I set L using recent lead-time observations (recent_N), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand periods (recent_N=5) so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate for the latest demand level while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding overstocks given holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=72, in-transit=290 \u2014 ample pipeline but past shipments showed variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods). Recent demand has shifted materially higher vs. early-sample periods (multiple weeks with demand 80\u2013145), so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. For lead time I use recent observed lead times to reflect the 1\u20132 period behavior (not trusting the promised 2 exclusively). Chosen methods: L from recent observed lead times to bias toward the shorter recent realizations; mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent demand samples (captures current higher mean and volatility) so the OR backend raises the base-stock appropriately while the capped order cap prevents extreme single-period replenishment.

Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 1\u20132 period lead times (multiple concluded samples across P4..P27), giving an average lead time below the promised 2 but >1. Recent demand (Periods 22\u201328) is elevated and more variable vs. early samples, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current higher mean and volatility. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend averages concluded lead-time samples. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to force the OR engine to target base stock appropriate to the recent higher-demand regime while the calculated L corrects for actual shorter average lead time; this balances service (capture current demand spike) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Demand has increased in recent summer weeks (Period 25-29 demands: 129,97,47,86,76); I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current higher demand regime. Set L explicitly to 1.6 to reflect observed delivered lead times (helps the OR engine size pipeline for ~1.6 periods rather than the promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to compute (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from the last 5 demand samples, capturing the recent summer demand pattern and higher variance.

To reflect the empirically observed lead-time distribution I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method: calculate). Demand has been elevated and variable in recent weeks; I bias the forecast toward recent weeks by using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean/volatility. I select N=8 (balances recent regime sensitivity with sample robustness). This combination keeps pipeline cover aligned to observed lead times while letting the OR engine set service-level via profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical concluded arrivals show recent actual lead times averaging ~1.6 periods (mix of 1\u20132), and earlier prolonged delays resolved into consistent 1\u20132 period arrivals. Given this, use inferred lead time via observed data (calculate) so backend uses empirical average. Demand history is stable-seasonal; use default demand/stretch estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect full sample mean and volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (captures recent shorter lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Recent demand since Period 20 is a higher regime (elevated weekly demands from Periods 20\u201332); to capture current demand level I use a recent-window forecast. Decisions: set L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized ~1.6 mean rather than promised 2); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 to reflect the higher-demand regime from Period 20\u201332 ((1+L)-scaled mean of last 13 samples); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to meet elevated demand while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid over-ordering for an assumed L=2, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

To be responsive to recent lead-time behavior while protecting against occasional 2-period delays, I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times. Demand has been volatile weekly; I use a recent-window estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using recent demand only. These choices bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand (improving service given in-transit uncertainty) while avoiding excessive holding cost by not inflating long-term mean from older spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=362 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple periods but arrivals have shown variable 1\u20132 period lead times recently. Concluded arrivals (Periods 27,30,32) give recent observed lead_times = 2,2,1 -> avg\u22481.67. Use recent_N for L (N=3) to reflect recent 1\u20132 period reality rather than the promised 2. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full history while the L update adjusts the review+lead horizon. This balances higher service from recognizing ~1.7 actual lead time against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=350. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (recent samples: 2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,3) with a recent central tendency ~1.6\u20131.8; I use a recent-average lead time to capture this shift away from the promised 2. Recent demand has moderated (last 5 demands: Periods 32\u201336 = 28,43,52,33,27 \u2192 mean \u224836.6). I set L to a recent_N estimate (N=5) to reflect the most recent realized lead-times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend bases base-stock and cap on the most recent demand regime. This balances service (shorter recent lead times) with lower current demand and avoids overstock given holding cost, while the large in-transit (350) already provides coverage for upcoming periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=350. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) with recent arrivals clustering around 1\u20132 and a 3-period outlier (P36). Demand in the last 5 observed periods (P33\u2013P37) averages ~37.4 units/week, lower than earlier peaks. To adapt to the recent regime and recent lead-time behavior while down-weighting older volatile history, I use recent_N with N=5 for lead time, demand, and volatility so the OR backend computes L and (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent 5 samples. This balances service (using recent shorter lead times) against holding cost given current in-transit coverage.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=350 (large pipeline, some past shipments were delayed). Recent demand (last 5 weeks) averaged ~37 units/week with moderate variability; use recent demand window to capture current lower autumn demand. For lead time use 'calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (history shows mostly 1\u20132 periods with occasional 3). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) focuses orders on the current regime and avoids overreacting to older high-season spikes; this plus the backend's capped order will limit new orders while the 350 units in-transit clear, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand history shows intermittent weekly demand with many concluded lead_times averaging ~1.6 periods recently; on-hand=0, in-transit=350 (sizable pipeline). I choose to let the OR backend compute a lead time estimate from observed arrivals (method='calculate') so it uses all concluded lead-time evidence. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I select default rules so backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level vs holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline and the moderate profit/holding cost ratio.

To reflect empirical lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed concluded arrivals (average lead time). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock estimate while letting the OR engine cap orders; this balances service (use observed shorter-than-promised lead times) against holding cost given the sizable in-transit volume and $1 holding cost.

History shows recent concluded lead times clustered 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.6 from recent arrivals) and earlier sustained delays for early-period orders; recent arrivals are consistent so use backend-calculated average lead time. Demand recently has been lower than mid-year peaks; to be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand moments (short horizon). Choices: L by 'calculate' (let backend average observed lead times); mu_hat and sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=8 to focus on the most recent demand regime and reduce bias from mid-year spikes. This balances avoiding overstock (low holding cost vs profit) while covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand and protecting against lead-time variability.

Historical concluded arrivals show varied lead times (1\u20133), recent average ~1.6 periods; earlier multi-period missing arrivals noted but later concluded arrivals are consistently 1\u20132 (with one 3). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 high service target), I let the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded history so L reflects realized variability, and use backend defaults for demand forecast and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This leverages all historical demand while letting OR engine apply the correct safety-stock z* and cap.

Recent concluded lead-times (last 5 arrivals) = 2,1,1,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.6; earlier sustained delays occurred but recent pattern is 1\u20132 periods. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201344) = [10,18,33,14,12] (low December demand). To reflect the recent stabilized lead-time and current low demand, I set L using recent_N on the last 5 observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples so the OR engine targets service around the current regime while accounting for pipeline. These choices reduce over-ordering given subdued season demand while preserving service given q\u22480.95.

Use L='calculate' so backend infers the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures recent 1\u20132 pattern while accounting for earlier delays). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, ensuring the base-stock and cap reflect full-sample demand variability and the chosen lead-time estimate.

Use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; with profit>>holding cost the backend will target a high service level while the chosen L captures the faster recent deliveries and avoids systematically over/under-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.
