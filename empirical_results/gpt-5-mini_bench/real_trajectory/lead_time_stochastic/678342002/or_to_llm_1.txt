OR recommends 39 using promised L=2 and historical demand; its base-stock would be to cover (L+1)=3 periods demand \u224866 plus safety. However pipeline (in-transit=237) already far exceeds 3-period expected demand (\u224866) and even a conservative 95% cap. Given prior history of variable/extended lead times and lost shipments, adding more inventory risks long-term holding cost without increasing sales (current demand is modest and sustained lower since Periods 39\u201345). Therefore place no new order this period to avoid excess holding cost while waiting for outstanding in-transit units to conclude and be observed in future period(s).",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows many past arrivals but the most recent conclude messages (Periods 17\u201346) include multiple periods with arrived=0 while in-transit remains 237, indicating outstanding shipments exist and some orders have long/variable lead times or are delayed. I will NOT assume those 237 units are lost because earlier patterns show late multi-period arrivals (e.g., lead times of 1\u20133 observed); however arrivals are not yet confirmed in concluded messages. Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=237. Recent realized demand (Periods 40\u201346) is low (6\u201333/week), well below the earlier regime spike (Periods 11\u201315) and below historical sample mean. Profit per unit = $19, holding = $1/period. Risk tradeoff: Ordering now risks overstock if in-transit arrives soon; not ordering risks stockouts only if many in-transit are actually lost. Given a large in-transit pipeline (237 >> typical weekly demand) and low recent demand, the prudent action is to place no new order this period and wait one more conclude to observe whether arrivals are confirmed. This minimizes holding cost exposure while preserving sales upside if shipments arrive. I therefore order 0 units of 678342002.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Cancel ordering this period (order=0): in-transit=237 units likely covers upcoming demand despite variable lead times; recent demand is low, so avoid extra holding cost and wait for confirmed arrivals.",
