Recent history shows several very large weeks (Period42=999, P43=922) but surrounding weeks are variable. b) Demand regime: Recent demand (P38\u2013P44) is elevated vs earlier low regime; short-term volatility is high. c) Lead time & lost orders: Promised LT=2; concluded arrivals across history show actual LT varies (1\u20133) and some earlier shipments were lost, but no new lost-order evidence in the last few periods. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=1400 units. With L=2 we must cover current period plus next L periods (3 periods) after decision. Conservatively forecast short-term weekly demand \u2248400 units (elevated/holiday-adjusted); 3-period demand \u22481,200 units. e) Order logic: In-transit (1400) already exceeds the 3-period coverage estimate (~1,200). Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is small versus profit ($19/unit), but excess inventory during uncertain LT and variable demand risks unnecessary holding. Therefore place no new order this period and consume in-transit stock to meet holiday demand; monitor arrivals to detect any lost shipments and update ordering if arrivals do not conclude.",

Demand analysis: recent concluded demands show two very large promo weeks (P42=999, P43=922) followed by P44=210, P45=245. A short-run elevated holiday demand estimate is appropriate. Simple short-run forecast: average of last 4 weeks \u2248594 units/week; cover (L+1)=3 periods \u2192 ~1,782 units projected demand. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1,200 \u2192 pipeline covers most but not all of 3-period need (shortfall \u2248582). Lead time: supplier promised 2; historical actual lead times have varied (1\u20133) and some lost orders occurred earlier, so treat in-transit as deliverable but be conservative. Decision logic: order enough to cover estimated shortfall for the next (L+1) periods while avoiding excessive holding during post-holiday drop. Recommend ordering 600 units (rounding shortfall up to provide small safety buffer).",
