Inventory economics: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period (holding cost equals profit), so excess inventory is costly. Given no on-hand stock and high holding cost, prioritize meeting likely immediate post-arrival demand while avoiding large safety stock. Forecast: target one-week demand around 150 units.

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is week of 2019-12-30 (holiday week/New Year). Demand historically around late Dec (P43\u2013P46) = 49,67,65,51 \u2192 recent mean \u224858 units/week; no clear holiday spike. Demand regime: recent 4 periods show moderate, stable low-60s demand; no new sustained shift (need \u22653 periods of change vs prior baseline to record). Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised 2; actual lead times have varied 1\u20133 historically. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=264 (these in-transit units should cover multiple weeks). Ordering policy: target coverage = (L+1)=3 weeks demand \u22483\xd758\u2248174 units. In-transit (264) already exceeds target; given profit=$1 and holding=$1 per unit/period (holding cost high relative to profit), avoid adding inventory to prevent negative impact. Therefore place no order this period.",
