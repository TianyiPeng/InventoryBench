Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (124,168,190,183,99) show no sustained regime shift (only 5 weeks, last value 99 not a persistent change). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals \u2192 no evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost with no unjustified manual adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 demand=112; historical samples range 99\u2013190. On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (order placed in P1, no arrival yet \u2014 promised lead time=2 so arrival expected later). No sustained changepoint in demand or lead time (single new observation only). Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility (use full-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) so backend base-stock policy relies on long-run stats while avoiding overfitting to one recent low demand point. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=429 (sum of P1=218 and P2=211). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 and 2 conclude show arrived=0), so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Use default lead time (promised L=2). Demand history (5 samples mean=152.8) will be used by backend: keep mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples; keep sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples. This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical demand while avoiding premature adjustments for shipments that are still in-transit.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=448; three consecutive conclude messages show orders placed in Periods 1-3 but arrived=0 \u2192 probable delayed/lost shipments. Demand observed in recent periods (Periods 1-3): 112, 169, 136. To be conservative given missing arrivals, set lead time explicitly longer than promised. Use recent 3-period demand to forecast (captures current regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (218,211,19) have not concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 sustained missing arrivals across 3 periods; treat as delayed/lost shipment risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) = [112,169,136,123] showing a modestly lower regime than the older 5-sample history; one confirmed lead time observation (Period2\u2192Period4) = 2 periods but multiple earlier orders (P1,P3) remain missing, so shipment loss/delay risk persists. I choose L=calculate to use the observed lead-time evidence (backend will average observed lead times) while keeping in mind missing arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to focus the forecast on the last 4 periods including the most recent realized demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias stocking toward current consumption patterns while letting the OR backend compute safety stock against the inferred lead time; they also avoid overreacting to older outlier samples given missing/in-transit uncertainty.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has declined versus older historical samples: last 5 realized weekly demands = [112,169,136,123,83] (mean=124.6) vs long-run mean=152.8. On-hand=5, in-transit=345; earlier shipments showed at least one confirmed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192arrived Period4) and there is sustained risk of missing/delayed shipments from Periods 1\u20133. To avoid excess holding cost given current low on-hand and large in-transit but uncertain arrivals, I use a recent-window demand forecast (capture the recent downshift) and infer lead time from observed arrivals. Choices: L set by calculating observed lead times (confirmed = 2); mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect the recent lower demand regime and reduce overstock risk; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (use pipeline + small on-hand) against holding cost given shipment uncertainty.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand samples (weekly Jan\u2013early Feb) have mean ~152.8 and moderate volatility. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=369; several earlier orders (Periods 1 and 3) remain unconcluded beyond promised lead time, signaling possible lost/delayed shipments, but we have one clear arrival showing an actual lead time of 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Therefore set lead time to be inferred from observed data (calculate) so backend uses confirmed lead-time behavior. Use default demand/statistics (all historical samples) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L) to avoid overfitting to short-term noise; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5 and moderate uncertainty. These choices account for delayed arrivals by relying on historical demand and confirmed lead time rather than only recent noisy periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=416. History shows sustained missing arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 and a confirmed observed lead time of 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). To reflect observed lead-time evidence while being robust to missing shipments, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will reproduce the confirmed 2). Given no strong, sustained demand regime change in the sample history, use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices keep base stock tied to historical mean demand while the calculated L captures the confirmed 2-period lead time; using defaults avoids overreacting to recent noisy/possibly lost arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent observed demands (last 5 periods) are lower (~100s) than earlier Jan samples (~150\u2013190); on-hand=0, in-transit=345 (large pipeline but earlier missing arrivals observed P1\u2013P3). Observed lead times from concluded messages: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 2 (P6\u2192P8), 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt. Use recent demand (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the downshift in realized demand and to avoid over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit. These choices balance service (capturing current demand over review+lead period) versus holding cost risk given delayed/lost shipment history and a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=345. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 2-period arrivals (confirmed at Period 7) and earlier missing arrivals from orders in Periods 1-3 indicate possible lost/delayed shipments but later evidence supports promised L=2. Recent demand has moderated vs. early-sample Jan values; last 5 concluded demands = [83,135,90,101,67], mean=95.2 so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture current regime. I set L to default (promised lead time 2) to align with confirmed observations. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce stockouts from recent demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=345. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8) and one 1 (P7\u2192P8); multiple early-period orders (P1\u2013P3) failed to conclude, indicating possible lost/delayed shipments but later evidence supports lead time \u22482. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 2-period behavior). Demand history is limited but shows no sustained, recent regime shift; use default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Defaults keep orders conservative while the calculated L accounts for observed lead-time evidence and helps the OR backend size pipeline to cover (L+1) periods, mitigating stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand (Periods 4\u201311) = [123,83,135,90,101,67,62,93], recent mean=94.25 \u2014 demand has been ~stable around ~95 units/week. Historical missing arrivals in Periods 1\u20133 indicate risk of lost/delayed shipments, but subsequent concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,2,1 periods. I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the recent regime (Periods 4\u201311) which reflects current demand levels and avoids old Jan samples. These parameters aim to size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while keeping variance estimates anchored to recent volatility given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. History shows intermittent arrivals with confirmed lead_time=2 in earlier periods and several missing/delayed shipments (Periods 1-3). I keep L as promised (default) because recent concluded arrivals are consistent with promised 2-period lead time overall. Demand has varied; recent 5 periods (Periods 8-12) show mean demand ~96/week with a spike to 157 in Period 12, so I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the current regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise (1+L)-period coverage to protect service against recent demand spikes while avoiding excessive holding given $1 holding cost equal to $1 profit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weekly demand samples show variability (historical samples mean=152.8); last observed demand = 83 (P13). On-hand=0, in-transit=345. Earlier periods showed sustained missing arrivals (Periods 1-3) but lead time has been confirmed as 2 in multiple concluded arrivals. To balance service vs holding cost I use the promised lead time and historical-sample based demand moments so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from full-sample mean/std, while preserving conservative treatment of in-transit pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,2,1,2] (avg ~1.75) with occasional 1 but mostly 2; earlier sustained missing arrivals (Periods1-3) noted but later arrivals confirm typical lead_time\u22482. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) = [62,93,157,83,71] \u2014 elevated variance with one spike but no sustained new regime. To balance service (profit=holding cost) use a slightly shorter/empirical lead estimate (recent average) and base demand on recent 5 periods to capture current mean/variance. This helps backend compute base_stock that covers (1+L) periods of recent demand while reflecting current volatility and guarding against lost shipments via slightly conservative lead-time estimate.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with confirmed actual lead times mostly 2 but one 1 observed; several early orders (Periods 1-3) showed sustained missing arrivals signaling shipment risk. On-hand=0, in-transit=363 \u2014 pipeline large but some past orders were delayed/lost. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 period variability). For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative given the noisy/partially missing arrivals and large in-transit volume. These settings balance service (by using empirical lead time) against holding cost given high pipeline units and shipment risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been volatile but no clear upward regime shift; historical samples (Jan-Feb 2019) still anchor forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=363 \u2014 significant pipeline but many earlier orders showed delayed arrivals; observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 periods (with one 1-period instance). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (reflecting confirmed L\u22482). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical conclues show observed lead times {2,2,1,2} (avg\u22481.75) and recent demand has risen with last 5 demands = [83,71,102,96,177] (notable spike in P17). There have been past missing arrivals (Periods 1-3) indicating lost/delayed shipments risk; using a data-driven lead time estimate and recent-demand forecast hedges service level while avoiding excessive holding. Selected L: calculate (use average of observed lead times \u2192 captures slight <2 mean). Selected mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (includes P17 spike). Selected sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded lead-time evidence includes confirmations of 2-period lead time; earlier missing arrivals (Periods 1-3) indicate lost/delayed risk but later arrivals align with L=2. Recent demand (Periods 13-18 = 24,83,71,102,96,177,201 \u2014 focusing on most recent 6 nonzero weekly demands) shows a higher, volatile regime vs. the Jan samples. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 2). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the elevated recent demand (so backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples) and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to protect service level given elevated demand and observed shipment risk while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 demands: P15-P19 = 102,96,177,201,203; mean ~155.8) vs earlier lower February/March values. On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (large pipeline) but history shows prior missing/delayed arrivals early in the run; however multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22482 in several cases. To balance higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed ~2 periods). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (use last 5 periods to reflect the demand surge). This focuses safety stock on current demand patterns and limits overreaction to older low-demand samples; using recent volatility helps the OR cap orders given the sizable existing pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=468. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2,2,1,2 (avg ~1.75) and earlier sustained missing arrivals (Periods 1-3) indicate shipment risk but more recent evidence supports ~2-period lead time. Recent demand has increased sharply since Period 17 (periods 17-20 demands: 177,201,203,216). I set L method='calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 4 periods: 177,201,203,216). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and matches replenishment to the higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility. These choices balance service (capture current demand spike) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock and prior delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: recent avg (Periods 17-20)=199 (+30% vs historical mean ~153); sustained for 4 periods

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=598. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 17 (recent avg Periods 17-20 ~199 vs historical ~153). Some earlier shipments (Periods 1-3) were lost; recent orders show one missed arrival (Period 19 order not concluded) but not yet a sustained loss pattern. Evidence of actual lead times: observed lead times = {2,2,1,2} (avg ~1.75) confirming typical 2-period behavior with occasional 1. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses recent evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 17-20). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while letting the backend cap orders using its cap calculation to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (Periods 17-20 avg \u2248199 vs historical \u2248153). Pipeline is large (537 in-transit) but earlier shortfall across Periods 1-3 indicates risk of missing/lost shipments; however multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22482. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures occasional 1 vs 2 period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 17-20). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices bias stocking toward satisfying the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap orders using its pipeline-aware cap to limit excess inventory given the large in-transit quantity.

Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (higher weekly demand ~200+ vs historical ~153) and multiple confirmed 2-period lead-time arrivals in the conclude messages. On-hand = 8, in-transit = 515 (large pipeline). I choose L="calculate" so backend averages observed concluded lead times (uses evidence-only inference). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to anchor mu_hat to the most recent elevated regime (captures recent weeks including the confirmed shift) so the base stock reflects higher demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the higher-demand regime) while acknowledging significant pipeline already in-transit and potential earlier delayed shipments; no new sustained lost-shipment pattern detected beyond previously recorded insights.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand regime high since Period 17 (avg ~199) and sustained through Period 24; current on-hand=0, in-transit=632 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (several confirmed 2s with occasional 1s). I select L via calculate to let the backend use observed lead-time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 17-24) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the new higher mean while sigma estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility; large existing in-transit reduces need for extra ordering and helps mitigate risk of lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand elevated vs historical (Periods 17-21 showed a sustained uptick) but last five weeks (P21-P25 demands = 233,263,164,109,123) show higher mean and notable variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=632 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times consistently 2 periods (multiple P->P+2 arrivals). I choose L by calculating observed lead times to let backend confirm the empirical average. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the post-changepoint regime while keeping responsiveness to the recent decline. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias base-stock toward recent higher demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to limit new ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=44, in-transit=482. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead time with occasional 1 and one 3-period event; several early orders (P1-3) never concluded indicating lost/delayed risk but later evidence confirms typical LT\u22482. Demand regime increased around Period 17 (Periods 17-20 avg elevated). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures occasional 1 and 3 period outcomes). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (use the confirmed post-changepoint regime P17-20) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices raise target base stock to serve the sustained higher demand while the calculated L accounts for observed LT variability and missing shipments.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand elevated vs historical (carry-over previously noted regime shift around Periods 17-20). Shipment history shows mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1 and 3; some earlier sustained missing arrivals (Periods 1-3) indicate lost/delayed risk but recent confirms center near 2. I choose L using recent_N to weight recent observed lead-time behavior while smoothing occasional 1/3 outliers. For demand and uncertainty I keep default formulas (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using the inferred L. This approach is conservative given large in-transit (482) and past missing arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods but with occasional 1 and one 3-period arrival; average of recent observed lead times \u22482. Recent demand has declined from the peak (Periods 17-23) \u2014 last 5 demands (Periods 24-28) = [109,123,106,96,57], mean \u224898.2. To balance service vs holding cost given large pipeline and recent lower demand, I set lead time based on the recent lead-time sample and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime. Volatility also estimated from the same 5 most recent samples so the backend can size safety stock appropriately.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. History shows mixed lead times (observed W values = [2,2,1,2,2,2,1,3], average ~1.875) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (higher mean). Several prior orders showed delayed/missing arrivals; to balance service vs holding cost I (1) infer lead time from concluded history using average, and (2) bias demand estimates toward the recent, higher regime. Therefore: set L via "calculate" to let backend use observed average lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (captures Periods 17+ recent elevated demand) so base-stock and caps reflect the sustained higher demand while limiting overstock given shipment uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concludes show past delayed/lost arrivals but lead-time was previously confirmed as 2; no new sustained lead-time change. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 (recent avg Periods 17-20 = 199 vs historical ~153), sustained 4 periods. To cover elevated demand, use a recent-window demand forecast (captures the +30% regime shift). Keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded evidence still supports LT=2 on average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (the confirmed regime length) so the OR backend increases target base-stock and volatility estimate to restore service level while recognizing holding cost risk; in-transit stock (482) will be reconciled by the engine against pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, In-transit=482. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-periods but occasional 1 and 3; earlier periods 1-3 had sustained missing arrivals (risk of lost/delayed shipments). Demand regime increased starting Period 17 (recent periods 17-31 show persistently higher demand vs historical mean). To reflect true lead-time variability I request the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method: calculate). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility, using the most recent regime (Periods 17-31). This biases base_stock upward to meet elevated demand while relying on the backend cap to limit overly large single orders and mitigating holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

On-hand=0, in-transit=482 \u2014 large pipeline but past periods show variable actual lead times (1\u20133). I set L using recent observed lead-times to reflect current delivery variability: recent_N N=5 (most recent 5 observed lead times avg\u22482). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 17\u201333, N=17) so mu_hat reflects the sustained elevated mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=17 to capture volatility in the same regime. These choices align supply targets to the higher demand while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding understocking given substantial in-transit but delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concluded lead times cluster around the promised 2 periods (multiple P->P+2 confirmations) and missing arrivals were previously flagged; no new sustained lead-time change observed. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P30-34 = 144,125,99,201,158) shows current regime closer to recent mean than the earlier mid-year spike, so I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most-recent demand level across the review+lead horizon. I keep L as default (promised) and sigma_hat as default to allow the OR engine to use full-sample volatility while the mu_hat focuses on recent demand; this balances service versus holding given profit=holding cost.

Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime starting Period 17 (noted in carry-over); recent weeks remain elevated. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent demand regime for the (1+L) horizon and to capture current volatility. These settings signal the OR backend to target service under the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance; using calculate for L aligns the lead-time estimate with observed arrivals and mitigates risks from lost/delayed historical shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 periods with occasional 1 and one 3; average observed lead time ~1.9. Demand has been elevated since Period 17 (already recorded). To account for observed lead-time pattern use the calculated average lead time. Use default demand/volatility (backend will scale by 1+L) so the OR engine uses full history mean and std while respecting the inferred lead time. This balances service (higher L increases mu_hat) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 17 (avg ~199) and remains elevated through Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are variable (recent observed values include 1,2,2,2,3); to reflect recent variability I set L via recent_N over the last 5 observed lead-time conclusions to let the backend average recent realizations. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 17\u201336 provide ~20 recent samples) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit quantity will cap actual order sizes via the OR engine cap and avoid excessive new orders despite higher mu_hat.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead time with occasional 1\u20133; several early orders (P1\u2013P3) failed to conclude indicating lost/delayed shipments risk. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concluded messages (captures empirical 1\u20133 variability while ignoring nondelivered orders). Demand has varied recently; to be responsive to the latest weeks I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent 5 demand observations (captures recent elevated and variable demand). These choices aim to raise target inventory modestly to cover short lead-time variability and recent demand while letting the backend cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost parity with profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=482 \u2014 sizable pipeline but history shows some lost/delayed shipments earlier; observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability vs promised=2). Recent demand (Periods 33\u201339) shows moderate volatility and no new sustained regime change, so I choose recent_N for demand and volatility to emphasize latest pattern: use the last 7 periods to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. These parameters bias ordering toward current demand while letting the large in-transit pipeline absorb some lead-time uncertainty and reduce unnecessary holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=482 \u2014 large pipeline but on-hand unavailable for current demand. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1\u20133; average observed lead time ~1.9. Demand regime shift at Period 17 (+30%) is sustained. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5), I (1) let L be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical avg (~1.9) instead of promised when forming (1+L), (2) set mu_hat to recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-change higher demand regime, and (3) set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the sustained higher demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering despite delayed arrivals risk.

Historical concludes show mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1 and 3 and some lost/delayed shipments earlier; recent concluded lead-times (most recent 5) average 2. Demand experienced a higher regime around Periods 17-20 but recent weekly demand (Periods 34-41) is mixed; to balance service vs holding (profit=holding so critical service), I set L to the recent average lead-time (robust to occasional 3s). I use a recent-demand mean to capture more current demand level while keeping sigma conservative (global sample std). These settings aim to size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while avoiding excessive holding given uncertain/occasionally delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (large pipeline but many past orders showed delayed/lost arrivals). Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 with some 1 and one 3; I use an averaged inferred lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 17; to respect that shift I bias demand forecast to recent regime. Therefore: L set to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to let backend infer ~1.9; mu_hat set to recent_N with N=4 to capture the post-shift higher demand regime; sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=4 to capture recent volatility. This balances service level (capture elevated demand) while avoiding excessive holding given current large in-transit pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed Ws mostly 2, some 1 and a 3) and several sustained missing arrivals earlier\u2014risk of delayed/lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded history (captures variability and past 3-period delay). Demand forecasting uses default (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to leverage the full historical demand series; given mixed recent lows and earlier sustained regime shift evidence, default avoids overfitting to short-term noise. These parameters balance service level (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost by relying on established historical demand dispersion.

Historical concludes show mostly 2-period lead time with occasional 3 and earlier missing arrivals; risk of delayed/lost shipments exists but recent long-run pattern supports using promised lead time. Demand regime increased around Period 17 and recent weeks remain variable; to bias forecast toward recent demand while smoothing older low-history, I use recent_N (last 20) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the upshift and recent variability. L uses default (promised lead time=2) so OR backend treats supplier as promised while we rely on pipeline quantity to cover exposure.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent calendar: pre-Christmas week with subdued observed demand (Periods 43-45 = 49,67,65) versus mid-year peak. On-hand=0, in-transit=482 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple periods; however history shows past delayed/lost shipments so do not assume immediate additional arrivals beyond concluded confirmations. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract (confirmed as 2 historically). For demand forecast apply EWMA to weight very recent low December demand while still retaining some memory of elevated mid-year levels (gamma=0.3). Volatility left to default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service vs holding given the large in-transit position and holiday softness.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=482 (multiple past orders outstanding; earlier carry-over flagged missing arrivals P1-3 and confirmed lead time=2). Recent realized demand (Periods 43-46 = 49,67,65,51) shows a pronounced drop vs mid-year spike; this low December level appears sustained over the last 4 periods, so use a short recent window to avoid overstocking the large in-transit balance. Set L to default (promised 2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed but previously confirmed as 2 and no new sustained lead-time shift is observed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime (protect against excess ordering given large in-transit inventory). These choices bias the OR backend toward a low target stock and lower orders, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service for current demand.
