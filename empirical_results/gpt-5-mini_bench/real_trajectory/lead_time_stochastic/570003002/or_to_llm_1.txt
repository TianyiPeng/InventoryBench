  "rationale": "Observation: on-hand=0, in-transit=214. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 observed) but no evidence that the entire pipeline is lost. Demand recent weeks: spikes (Period 42=99) but typical weeks ~40\u201380; 3-period demand (L+1=3) worst-case spike ~99\xd73=297, but pipeline=214 still materially large and will likely cover several weeks of normal demand. OR base-stock capped policy recommends 0 (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0 \u2192 base_stock equals forecasted demand; cap further limits orders). Placing additional order risks high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit) and OR already caps to 0. Given large in-transit, uncertain but mixed lead times, and high holding cost, I will follow OR and order 0 units to avoid excess holding cost while letting in-transit stock arrive and be observed in subsequent conclude messages. I will monitor concluded arrivals to detect lost shipments or sustained demand surge and adjust future orders accordingly.",
