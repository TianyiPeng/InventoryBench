Adjustment decision: Because demand is rising rapidly and holding cost is low ($1 vs $19 profit), I increase OR's 102 to 120 to better cover the observed higher mean (~86) over the (L+1)=3-period protection horizon and to buffer further growth and variable arrivals.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "History shows large pipeline (in-transit=255) from earlier orders and recent concluded periods (P30\u2013P46) show a sustained low-demand regime (avg \u224820/week over P30\u2013P46, and last 3 weeks even lower ~15). Promised L=2 but past evidence includes delayed/variable lead times and some late arrivals; however the visible pipeline already far exceeds the (L+1)-period coverage needed. Required coverage for (L+1)=3 periods at ~20 mean \u224860 units. With on-hand 0 + in-transit 255 >> 60, placing any new order risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $19. OR recommended 44 uses promised lead time and longer-horizon history and therefore is overly aggressive given current low demand and large pipeline. I therefore place no order this period to avoid extra holding cost and let existing pipeline arrive (or reveal losses) before replenishing.",
