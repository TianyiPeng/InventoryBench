Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks: 52,69,123,141,125) show no sustained regime change; no concluded arrival history (on-hand=0, in-transit=0) so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) L=2. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the full review+lead demand based on available history, and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed variability. This conservative choice relies on full-sample statistics until we observe concluded arrivals or a clear demand shift; it balances service level (via base-stock from observed mean/variance) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u2248102 units/week; no sustained changepoint detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=167 (order placed P1) \u2014 the P1 order showing arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised lead time=2 (arrival will be observed in a later conclude). No evidence yet of lost shipments or lead-time drift (need \u22653 periods of consistent misses). Therefore use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps: L=default, mu_hat=default (uses all samples), sigma_hat=default (uses all samples). This balances service level (covering L+1 periods of demand) against holding cost while remaining conservative given limited history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=333 (matches two outstanding orders of 167 and 166). No concluded arrivals yet beyond promised lead time; insufficient evidence to change lead-time estimate. Recent observed demand (P1=127, P2=165) is higher than earlier Jan samples but only 2 periods of elevated demand \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (avoid falsely assuming lost/longer lead time). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent data while retaining sample context: (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. Keep sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher recent demand signals with caution about shipment uncertainty and holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (historical weeks Jan-Feb) show mean ~102 units/week. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 467 (sum of orders P1-P3). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (167,166,134) have not concluded/arrived after \u22652 promised periods \u2192 sustained delays. To guard against longer actual lead time / missing arrivals, set L explicitly to 3 (conservative). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a larger review+lead demand to raise target base-stock and mitigate stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (167,166,134) have not arrived after promised lead_time=2 \u2192 evidence of extended/missing lead time (treat as \u22653 periods until contradicted).

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent history: Period4 showed arrival of the Period2 order with observed lead_time=2; Periods1 and3 orders remain unarrived (possible lost/delayed), but we have one confirmed lead-time=2 observation. On-hand=20, in-transit=389 (pipeline large vs. demand history). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirmation of 2 from Period2 arrival). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this balances service level given current large pipeline while avoiding overreacting to possibly lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent concluded history shows high demand (last concluded demands: 127,165,168,146,127) and on-hand=0, in-transit=410. One concluded arrival confirmed promised lead time=2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4), and other earlier orders remain missing but not yet confirmed as longer lead time. Because we lack sustained, conclusive evidence of a systematic lead-time increase or a new demand regime, use default methods so the OR backend applies the promised L and full-sample demand statistics: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level versus holding cost while preserving conservative response to potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1 and 3 (167, 134) have not arrived after promised lead_time=2; treat these as potentially lost or delayed until further conclude evidence.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history: mixed lead-time evidence \u2014 one order (P2\u2192arrived P4) showed LT=2, another (P5\u2192arrived P6) showed LT=1; some earlier orders (P1,P3) remain unobserved and may be delayed/lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=407 \u2014 pipeline large versus zero on-hand so risk of stockouts reduced but missing arrivals suggest lead-time uncertainty. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures recent variability 2 and 1). For demand, use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, providing a stable forecast from available 5-sample history while letting OR engine compute safety stock given the inferred L. This balances service level (using observed faster LT sometimes) against holding cost and the observed missing shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent weekly demand has been stable-high (~127\u2013168; recent average ~146 across last 5 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=427; several early-period orders remain delayed suggesting actual lead times have been inconsistent and some shipments overdue. I set L explicit=3 to conservatively account for observed extended/missing lead times (promised=2 but multiple orders exceeded that). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 3\u20137: demands 168,146,127,131,144) which best reflects current demand level; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service against delayed arrivals while keeping variability and holding cost grounded in the latest demand evidence.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=559 from prior orders (total ordered through P8 = 784, arrived so far = 225). Concluded arrivals show mixed actual lead times (observed lead_times = 2 from P2->P4, 1 from P5->P6, 2 from P6->P8, 1 from P7->P8) => recent average \u22481.5. Demand recent five periods (P4-P8 = 146,127,131,144,178) shows an elevated regime with mean \u2248145.2. To reflect the observed mixed/shorter-than-promised lead times but avoid overreacting to single-period 1s, set L by averaging the last 4 observed lead times (recent_N, N=4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent 5-sample windows (recent_N, N=5) to capture the current higher demand regime. These choices let the OR backend compute base_stock that balances higher recent demand against holding cost while acknowledging variable lead time and outstanding in-transit pipeline.

I set lead time explicit=3 to be conservative given sustained missing arrivals beyond promised 2. Demand sample mean = 102 (from provided five samples); (1+L)=4 \u2192 mu_hat = 4 * 102 = 408 to cover review+lead demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1.6 realized lead-time vs promised=2). For demand forecast and volatility I select defaults so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L). This balances service (using observed lead-time) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock and recent demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=6, in-transit=389. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,2} (avg 1.6) \u2014 variation around promised L=2 but no sustained shift to >2. Demand has been higher recently than the 2019 Jan samples; I use a recent demand window to reflect elevated recent weekly demand. Set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (higher recent weekly demand). Keep sigma_hat default to leverage full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (capture recent higher demand and observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given existing large in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weekly demand has been volatile but centered near ~100 units/week (historical samples avg ~102). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (multiple past orders outstanding; some shipments have been delayed/missing in early periods but concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods). I choose to let the backend infer an empirical lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) to reflect observed 1\u20132 period variability. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1. This keeps parameters data-driven and responsive to concluded lead-time evidence while avoiding overreacting to potentially lost shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent concludes show multiple late/missing arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders still not fully arrived earlier; several orders exceeded promised LT=2), so treat lead time as extended. I set L explicitly to 3 to account for observed delays (conservative one-period extension). Demand has shifted upward from the Jan baseline; I use recent_N (last 5 demand samples) to capture the current regime (reduces weight of older low-season samples). sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices increase on-hand targeting to cover the longer effective pipeline while keeping variability grounded in the most recent demand history, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given delayed shipments.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=391. Recent observed lead times in concluded messages are mostly 1\u20132 periods (several 2s, some 1s); use averaged observed lead time to let backend reconcile variability and detect losses. Recent demand (Periods 10\u201314) averages ~83.6 units/week; use a recent_N=5 demand estimate to capture the current lower post-receipt regime and avoid overstock given holding cost. Use matching recent_N=5 for volatility to reflect recent variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand history shows weekly demands 52,69,123,141,125 (mean=102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391; several early orders (Periods 1,3) remain missing/lost per prior carry-over. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 avg \u2248 1.67. To account for the mixed but predominantly 2-period realizations while letting the OR engine compute demand-over-review+lead sizing, I set L via calculate (average observed lead times) and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so the backend uses (1+L)*overall mean and sqrt(1+L)*overall std from all samples. This balances service (captures extended lead time evidence) without overfitting short noisy arrivals given some lost shipments.

Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2} (avg\u22481.67) but some early orders remain missing/lost (Periods 1 & 3). Demand history samples (weekly) used as baseline; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures mix of 1\u20132 period realizations while not trusting isolated missing shipments). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

There are multiple short/variable observed lead times (1 or 2) and some earlier missing shipments documented; no new sustained lead-time shift is conclusively observed. To be conservative I keep promised lead time and base demand forecast on the most recent regime: use recent_N=5 to capture current lower-average demand and recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent demand) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost > profit ratio.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has dropped versus earlier spikes: last 4 weekly demands = [40,29,29,24], indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. Historical concluded lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2) with some earlier missing shipments; to be robust I use a short recent average for lead time and base demand/volatility on the most recent 4 weeks to capture the new lower regime while keeping responsiveness to late-arriving shipments. Methods chosen: L recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent observed lead-time mix; mu_hat recent_N (N=4) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility under the new lower-demand regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has declined versus early-spring levels: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [40,29,29,24,10] (mean\u224826.4) vs historical sample mean\u2248102. On-hand=0, in-transit=391 which likely covers several future weeks but some past shipments were delayed/lost per carry-over notes. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 or 2 periods); using 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times. To adapt to the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) so the forecast and volatility reflect the sustained drop. This reduces over-ordering risk given high in-transit inventory and holding cost, while the backend cap will still limit order size if pipeline already sufficient.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent weekly demand has settled well below early-year peaks (recent demands P17\u2013P21 = 29,29,24,10,20 \u2192 mean \u224822.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline from earlier orders, some shipments long-delayed). Historical conclude messages show multiple orders missing beyond promised L=2 (Periods 1\u20133 never arrived within 2 periods) \u2014 evidence supports treating actual lead time as at least 3. To avoid under-ordering while controlling holding cost, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (captures the observed extended delays). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new lower-demand regime (uses last 5 observed demands); sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward matching current low demand while acknowledging longer arrival delays and existing pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=391; past periods show some missing/late arrivals but concluded lead times cluster at 1\u20132 with no sustained confirmation of >2. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for sporadic missing shipments. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low-demand regime and reduce stock risk given holding cost >0. This balances service (cover short near-term demand) vs holding cost by forecasting lower (recent) demand while keeping L at promised.

Because multiple earlier orders failed to conclude on the promised L=2, I explicitly increase lead-time to 3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=5), so the base-stock forecast is downsized for lower summer demand while still accounting for extended lead-time and the large in-transit position.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has declined from spring peaks (Apr-May) to a sustained low in Jun-Jul (most recent 10 demands: 29,29,24,10,20,11,9,6,0?,0? \u2014 average materially lower than earlier). Pipeline shows 391 in-transit but on-hand 0 and prior carry-over notes indicate some early-period shipments were missing; however concluded arrivals since Period 4 show lead times of 1\u20132 and no new sustained lead-time change. I therefore keep promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting to earlier missing shipments. To reflect the clear downward demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 (captures the low-demand regime) so (1+L)*mean uses the recent mean. I set sigma_hat to default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since volatility evidence is mixed and default prevents overfitting. These choices bias orders down to avoid holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline provides cover for near-term demand and the OR backend cap will limit order spikes.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has fallen sharply from early-highs (~100\u2013170) to low steady weekly demand (~6\u201329). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20132 periods) and earlier missing shipments, so I avoid relying on early high-demand history. I set L to recent_N to reflect the most recently observed lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 6 weeks) so the base-stock targets (which scale with 1+L) match current demand and reduce holding cost exposure. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current lower volatility. These choices prioritize reducing overstock given low recent demand while acknowledging lead-time variability from recent concludes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=391. History shows multiple delayed/missing shipments earlier (Periods 1-3 missing long past promised L=2), so actual lead time appears extended; to be conservative set L higher. Recent demand has dropped sharply from winter (mean ~102 from early samples) to recent 10-week average ~15.3 (Periods 17-26). I set L explicitly to 3 to capture observed extended/missing lead times. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand on the confirmed low-demand regime (10 most recent periods). I use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given sustained low demand while accounting for longer arrival delay and the large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting ~Period 17: recent 10-period avg demand=15.3 vs early-sample avg\u2248102 (\u2248-85%); sustained low-demand regime confirmed.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history (Periods 17-27) shows a sustained low-demand regime (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline from prior orders). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2,1} \u2192 average \u22481.57; thus use calculated average lead time. Set L by 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 10 samples). For volatility, use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent lower variability. These choices bias orders toward the new low-demand regime while the large existing in-transit pipeline limits new order quantity, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 \u2014 large pipeline but past missing/delayed shipments were observed earlier; concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20132 periods). I set L="calculate" so backend infers average actual lead time from concluded history (reflects observed 1\u20132 period realizations while ignoring lost orders). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (use last 10 samples to scale (1+L) mean and sqrt(1+L) std). This keeps target base-stock aligned to the new low demand while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula, preventing excessive replenishment against the large in-transit volume.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early-sample avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline from earlier orders). Concluded arrivals do not provide new evidence to change the promised lead time (no recent concluded lead_time >2); therefore keep L as default (promised=2). For demand I rely on the confirmed low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint samples (regime length Period17\u201329 \u224813), and apply the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices reduce target stock for the lower demand regime while acknowledging existing in-transit stock to avoid overordering.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 \u2014 large pipeline relative to current low demand, so do not inflate forecasts. Promised lead time=2; although earlier periods showed delayed/missing shipments, arrivals since then have been a mix of 1\u20132 periods and some losses. To respect the backend's promised-L assumption while reacting to the confirmed low-demand regime, I use the recent 10 samples to set demand forecast and volatility (captures current low mean/variance) and keep the promised lead time (default). This keeps orders minimal given the large in-transit stock and reduces holding cost exposure while maintaining service on expected low demand.

Historical concluded lead-times vary (observed 1\u20132 periods) with some missing/ delayed shipments earlier but no new sustained lead-time confirmation in conclude messages; demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use 'default' so backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L); this balances service level against holding cost given low recent demand and existing large in-transit volume. No new corrective action recorded here.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (avg \u224815/week vs early avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (many earlier shipments long-delayed or possibly lost). Promised L=2 has seen missed arrivals; treat lead time as extended to 3 to be conservative. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delays. For demand forecast use recent_N over the low-demand regime: N=16 (Periods 17\u201332) to capture current lower mean/variance. Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent low-demand samples, which reduces ordering relative to historical high-demand and limits holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Historical concludes show a sustained low-demand regime starting ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg demand = 15.3 vs early avg \u2248102). Multiple earlier shipments were delayed/lost (carry-over history), so actual lead time has trended longer; to be conservative set L=3. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the confirmed low-demand regime (N=10 matches the documented recent 10-period avg and captures the sustained shift). This reduces ordering to match current low demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $4 (lower service target).

For demand forecast I use recent_N N=10 to capture the current low-demand regime ( (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples ). Sigma uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent low-volatility demand. These choices reduce target base-stock for the sustained low-demand regime while accounting for longer lead time risk to avoid overstocking given 391 units already in-transit.

On-hand=0, large in-transit=391 (likely covers upcoming demand). Use lead-time estimate based only on concluded arrivals (observed lead times avg \u22481.57) -> choose calculate. For demand forecast use recent 20 periods to capture the new low-demand regime (recent_N N=20). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings instruct the OR backend to size base-stock for the current low-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and the large incoming pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (weekly demands mostly single digits). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline but many earlier shipments were delayed/lost historically). Use promised lead time (default=2) because concluded arrivals show predominantly 1\u20132 periods and no recent confirmed permanent lead-time change. Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=10) to capture the last 10 weeks' mean (reduces ordering to match current low demand). Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize avoiding excess holding cost given low demand and large in-transit inventory while still covering (1+L) review+lead demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): on-hand=0, in-transit=391. Historical concludes show earlier missing/extended shipments but most observed lead_times are 1\u20132 periods (several 1s and 2s). Demand has shifted to a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early avg \u2248102). To reflect actual observed lead-time behavior I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (method: calculate). To capture the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility focus on the latest low-volume regime and avoid over-ordering the large in-transit amount.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline from earlier orders; some past orders were delayed/missing). Historical concluded lead times vary and multiple early shipments were delayed/lost; to be conservative I set lead time explicit=3 (treating missing/delayed shipments as \u22653 until contradicted). Because demand is clearly in a new low regime I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent 10 weeks, which avoids overstating demand from early high-demand samples and keeps inventory low given holding cost >0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 17 (recent 10-period avg \u224815.3 vs early avg \u2248102). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (some in-transit shipments date from earlier periods; multiple past orders were delayed or missing after promised L=2). Given repeated late/missing arrivals, I conservatively set lead time longer than promised to avoid under-ordering. I use recent-N demand estimates (last 10 weeks) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and recent volatility. These parameters reduce risk of overstock while covering expected demand over the review+lead period under the longer lead time assumption.

No recent conclude messages contradicting promised lead_time=2, so use default lead time. To avoid overstocking given the confirmed low-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the low-demand window, reducing order quantity and holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline of older orders that may be delayed/lost but arrivals must be inferred only from concluded messages). Observed concluded lead times (from history) vary 1\u20132 periods; I select L='calculate' to let backend average actual observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overweighting high early-season peaks. Similarly use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat so volatility reflects the recent low-demand window. These choices focus orders on current low demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service for the low-volume regime.

On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (many outstanding shipments may be delayed/lost). Given historical evidence of extended/missing lead times earlier and large outstanding pipeline, I conservatively set lead time = explicit 3 periods to allow the OR engine to plan for slower arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N=10 to capture the sustained low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so base stock reflects current low mean and variability, reducing excess holding cost while maintaining service.

On-hand=0, in-transit=391 \u2014 pipeline far exceeds expected consumption. Historical missing shipments earlier imply lead-time has been extended/lost; conservatively set L=3 to reflect observed delays. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std respectively). With large pipeline inventory, this avoids new replenishment while the in-transit stock clears, reducing holding cost risk.
