Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01) show stable baseline demand: mean=48.6 units/week, std\u22483.72. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for review+lead. Promised lead time is 2 periods and there is no concluded arrival history to suggest a lead-time change or lost shipments. I select default lead time to use the promised 2-period setting, and default demand volatility/forecast methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This balances service level (using 3-period coverage of stable historical mean) against holding cost given modest variability and high per-unit profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18 (Period 2). Recent demand history (5 samples) shows mean \u224848.6/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=56 (order placed Period 1) and Period 1 conclude reported arrived=0 \u2014 this is expected given promised lead time and not sufficient to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipment. I therefore keep L as default (promised 2). Use default demand estimates so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) with current pipeline while avoiding overreaction to a single non-arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent weekly demand history (5 samples) averages ~48.6 units/week; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm lead-time shifts. On-hand=0, in-transit=111 (covers several weeks). Use promised lead time (default) to let backend assume L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent concluded periods show no visible arrivals yet but per lead-time rules these orders (placed P1\u2013P3) would only be observable later; cannot confirm a lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=175 (pipeline large). Use promised lead time to let OR backend account for promised L=2. Use default demand estimates based on all historical samples (mean=48.6) scaled by (1+L) to capture expected demand over review+lead period; let backend compute volatility from full sample set. This balances service (large in-transit) against holding cost without overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1045.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand 0, in-transit 141. Recent observed arrival: order placed Period 2 arrived in Period 4 => observed lead_time=2. Recent demand (Periods 1-4): 49, 67, 76, 75 showing a sustained uptick vs older Jan samples (45,52,45,54,47). I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed lead_time=2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new, higher demand regime; this ensures the OR backend targets higher base stock and adjusts safety stock for recent variability while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand samples. This also accounts for the 2-period promised lead time and the need to cover (1+L) periods of demand given in-transit inventory and potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived Period 4). Demand regime shift: recent Periods 1-4 avg=66.75 vs older Jan avg=48.6 (+37.6%), sustained for 3 recent periods (P2-P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has stepped up vs Jan (sustained higher mean since P2); on-hand=0, in-transit=229 which already covers multiple review+lead periods. Lead time confirmed previously as 2; to reflect the recent higher-demand regime I set L explicitly=2 and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the latest 4 demand observations (P2\u2013P5). This balances service (capture elevated demand) while leveraging large in-transit stock to limit additional over-ordering.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand (Periods 2-6) has settled well above Jan baseline; evidence of a sustained higher regime. Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows order P2\u2192P4 (LT=2), P6 shows order P5\u2192P6 (LT=1) \u2192 mixed evidence, so use calculated average lead time. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the elevated recent regime (captures the most recent high-demand weeks while meeting the N selection rules). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts given elevated demand while keeping holding cost reasonable via backend cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand has risen sharply: last 3 periods (P5-P7) demands = [73,87,109], indicating a new high-demand regime. Pipeline shows 231 units in-transit and on-hand=0; some past orders arrived later than promised (observed lead times 2 and 1). To capture the current elevated demand while controlling holding cost, I set L to the observed-average lead time and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime (higher mean and volatility) and drive the backend to order enough to meet the elevated demand without excessive overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg increased from 66.75 (P1-P4 recent) to 89.67 (P5-P7) (+34.3%), sustained for 3 periods; observed lead times = 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6), average 1.5.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=231. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift: Periods 5-7 avg demand \u224889.7 (up ~34% vs prior recent avg 66.8) and recent high demands (P5:73, P6:87, P7:109, P8:125). Observed lead times in concludes = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)] \u2014 recent average = 1.5. To align OR inputs with the recent high-demand regime and variable lead time I set L via recent_N over the last 4 observed lead times (captures 1.5 avg). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to target the P5\u2013P7 high-demand regime (keeps base_stock responsive to sustained uplift). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect elevated recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts during the new higher-demand regime) while the averaged lead-time estimate guards against over-ordering if some shipments are delayed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has stepped up vs Jan baseline (historical Jan mean 48.6) and recent weeks are much higher (Periods 4-9 mean \u224892.7). Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P4),1 (P6),2 (P8),1 (P8)] \u2192 avg 1.5. To capture the sustained higher demand regime, set lead time estimate as recent_N over the 4 observed lead times (avg=1.5) and base demand forecast on the most recent 6 demand observations (Periods 4-9) to reflect the new higher mean/volatility. Sigma uses the same recent 6 window to represent current volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service while keeping sigma driven by recent variability; they also acknowledge in-transit inventory (370) when the OR engine computes final order.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has stepped up: last 6 period demands = [73,87,109,125,87,137], mean=103 (much higher than Jan baseline ~48.6). On-hand=92, in-transit=141 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand (233) covers ~2.26\xd7 recent-week demand but recent volatility and mixed lead-time evidence (alternating 2 and 1) warrant using recent observations. Lead time: use recent_N to capture observed alternating 2/1 arrivals (avg ~1.5). Demand forecast (mu_hat): use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the new, sustained higher regime (3+ periods). Sigma: use recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility. These choices push the OR engine to hold more safety stock to avoid stockouts during the elevated-demand regime while reflecting observed lead-time variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=285 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible arrivals this conclude; recent history shows alternating lead times (2,1,2,1,2,1) so average lead time ~1.5. Demand has stepped up since early March (sustained higher regime from Periods 5\u201311). To capture current higher demand I use recent demand samples (most recent 7 periods) for mu and sigma while letting L be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine internal base-stock reflects the shorter/variable lead behavior. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent data for volatility and mean rather than all old low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows alternating lead times of 1 and 2 (multiple arrivals: P4: LT=2; P6: LT=1; P8: LTs=2,1; P10: LTs=2,1) => use observed-average lead time. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=414 (many pending arrivals); several recent periods (P9-P12) show substantially higher demand than early-sample Jan data. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect reality vs. promised. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 8 concluded demand samples to capture the new higher-demand regime (captures P5\u2013P12 signals). I set sigma_hat recent_N over same recent window to reflect realized volatility. These choices push the OR backend to raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while using observed lead-time to avoid under/over-ordering; large in-transit is noted so the backend cap will limit order quantity accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg demand for P5-P7 was 89.67 vs P9-P12 avg=127.25 (+41.8%), sustained for 4 periods (P9-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime: P9-P12 mean elevated (~127.25) for 4 periods; P13 dropped to 78 (not yet a sustained change). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] (average 1.6) \u2014 mix of 1\u20132 with recent persistence of both. On-hand=66 + in-transit=276 -> pipeline=342 units. I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent average lead time (1.6 \u2248 2 but reflecting 1/2 mix). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to target the sustained high regime (P9-P12) when computing (1+L)*mean, avoiding overreacting to the single lower period P13. Sigma is recent_N (N=4) to reflect volatility in the most recent high-demand regime. These choices bias the base-stock toward covering the confirmed high-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=118, in-transit=273. Recent concluded lead-time observations = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg ~1.63) with more recent bias toward 2; shipments mostly arriving but some 1-period occurrences. Demand regime: a sustained higher regime began at Period 9 (P9-P12 avg=127.25) though P13-14 dipped (78,77) \u2014 not yet a 3-period new regime. I choose L via recent_N to reflect the most recent lead-time mix (N=5) so backend uses a short >1.5 estimate rather than default promised. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 9-12 regime length=4) to capture the recently confirmed elevated demand regime while avoiding overreacting to the last two low-demand dips. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to match volatility in that recent regime. These choices bias base-stock upward to cover the sustained higher demand and variable lead times while avoiding excess inventory from transient dips.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=65, in-transit=322. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1s and 2s (observed list: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.625), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand has materially changed: last three periods (P13-P15) show lower demand (78,77,53; avg\u224869.33) versus the earlier high regime (P9-P12 avg=127.25). I therefore use a recent_N (N=3) forecast for mu_hat to capture the newest regime and use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This keeps the OR backend focused on current lower demand while L calculation captures the validated mixed lead-time behavior; given high profit/low holding (q\u22480.95) the backend will still target a high service level but using recent demand avoids overstock from the short-lived peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg decreased from 127.25 (P9-P12) to 69.33 (P13-P15), -45.5% over 3 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=322. Recent concluded lead times show mix of 1 and 2 periods; using a short recent average to capture drift. Demand has exhibited multiple regime shifts; most recent sustained low regime is Periods 13-15 (avg=69.33). To avoid overstocking given holding cost $1 vs profit $19, I forecast using the recent low regime (3 periods) and match lead-time estimate to recent observed lead times (last 4). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed low-demand regime while reflecting the observed 1\u20132 period lead-time variability and large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=273 (large pipeline). Recent realized demand (P13-P17) averages ~77 units/week; earlier periods showed higher spikes but last 5 are stable. Observed lead times include 1s and 2s; use calculate to average observed lead times so OR sees inferred lead-time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target replenishment to the most recent demand regime and avoid overstocking given substantial pipeline inventory. This balances service (cover next review+lead demand) against low holding cost and current high in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on P11 arrived P13, P12->P14, P15->P17)

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

With promised L=2 confirmed and substantial pipeline (273), set L to default (promised). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (summer demand ~74 avg) so the OR engine orders to cover (1+L)\xb7recent mean and recent volatility; this balances higher recent demand vs low holding cost to avoid stockouts while not overstocking given large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals with some 1-periods, and carry-over evidence has confirmed lead time=2 in prior checks; recent demand has elevated and volatile (last 3 concluded demands: P17=88, P18=60, P19=135). To protect service with promised L=2 and capture recent demand regime, set L explicitly to 2 and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime). This biases orders toward meeting elevated near-term demand while keeping holding cost moderate.

On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline). To avoid overreacting to a short run of high demand while respecting confirmed LT=2 and the backend's base-stock calculation, use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and promised lead time. This balances service level vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Lead time history has repeatedly confirmed 2-period arrivals; use promised lead time. Set demand forecast using most recent 3 periods to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping variability from the same window. With (1+L)=3 this reflects expected demand over review+lead; large in-transit inventory likely already covers several periods, so these parameters prevent the OR engine from under-forecasting while preserving service vs. holding tradeoff (profit/holding implies high service target embedded in backend).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Lead time evidence from concluded periods remains consistent with promised L=2 (most recent conclude: P20->P22 arrived=118, lead_time=2). No new sustained demand regime change (needs 3+ consistent periods) since prior insights. To react to recent demand volatility while respecting confirmed lead time, use L=default (promised 2). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 4 weeks. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) so variance reflects recent variability and produces appropriate safety stock. This balances service-level (capture recent high demands) versus holding cost by tightening forecasts to the most recent data while keeping lead time at the confirmed promised value.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=103, in-transit=297. Historical concluded lead times show many 2-period observations with some 1s; average of observed lead times is higher than 1 so I choose to have backend calculate the average ('calculate') to capture observed variability. Demand has shifted several times; recent demand samples (Periods 20-23 = 163,85,51,69) are most relevant for the coming (1+L) horizon, so I use recent_N with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime and volatility. These settings let the OR engine size base stock to cover the short, recent demand regime while the calculate L captures the empirically observed lead-time mix, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given recent high spikes) against holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals with occasional 1-period; recent confirmed pattern supports promised lead time. Demand has been volatile with recent elevated summer demand and a spike in Period 24 (136). To be responsive to the recent regime and keep service while holding cost is low (holding=$1 vs profit=$19 \u2192 high target service level), I set L=default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing short blips; this uses the last 8 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so the OR backend can size base stock and cap appropriately. No confirmed new sustained changepoint to record.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=413. Recent demand has shifted up vs Jan baseline; last 6 concluded demands (P20\u2013P25) = [163,85,51,69,136,107], mean=101.83 per week. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concluded arrivals support L=2. I set L=default to keep promised lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the latest regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to reflect review+lead demand under the current elevated regime. I use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. With in-transit=413 and (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248305, pipeline currently exceeds the (L+1) demand forecast; these choices let the OR engine compute a base stock that preserves service while avoiding unnecessary additional ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=402 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrivals historically confirm actual lead time \u22482 with occasional 1\u20133 variability. Recent demand (Periods 23-26 = 69,136,107,73) shows a higher summer regime vs earlier winter; using a recent-window forecast preserves responsiveness to this regime. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (avg \u22482). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 (covers the 4 most recent weeks) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the current elevated and volatile summer demand; this balances service (avoid stockouts while pipeline clears) against holding cost given large in-transit quantity.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=36, in-transit=303. Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 periods (multiple confirmations) with occasional 1\u20133 period noise; no new sustained lead-time change. Recent demand has softened from prior peaks: last 4 demands (P24\u2013P27)=136,107,73,63 -> mean=94.75, suggesting a lower recent regime than earlier peaks. To keep orders responsive to this recent decline while respecting promised lead time, I use default lead time (promised L=2) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent 4 periods (captures the newest regime and keeps N>=3). This reduces risk of overstock given large in-transit volume and observed shipment variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=344. Recent demand (P25-P28) = [107,73,63,51], average ~73.5; recent four periods show a lower, stable regime versus earlier volatility. Lead times historically vary but multiple confirmations of 2-period lead time; using a recent-demand baseline preserves responsiveness while respecting promised lead time. Set L to default promised lead time to align with OR engine assumptions; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility so orders won't overshoot given large in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has moderated: last 4 demands (P26-P29) = [73,63,51,59], avg=61.5 \u2014 lower than earlier spikes and appears a new short-run regime of ~60\u201365 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=344 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary but recent confirmed observations support the promised lead time; use promised L=2 to match contract and OR backend expectations. Set demand forecast using recent_N over the last 4 periods to capture the current moderated regime (N=4). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters keep orders responsive to the recent lower demand while pipeline inventory (344) already covers multiple weeks, reducing immediate refill size and avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 ample pipeline but actual arrivals lag/variability observed. Use calculated average lead time to capture realized variability; leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level versus holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Historical concluded lead-times cluster around 2 (multiple confirmations) with occasional 1\u20133 period deviations; no new sustained lead-time shift since Period 18. Recent demand has been variable but no new 3+ period sustained regime change after Period 18. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies q\u22480.95 (high service target). Given large in-transit volume and no new sustained demand/lead-time regime, use the promised/default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR engine's capped policy can apply the high service level while respecting the pipeline cap.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been low after volatile summer: last 4 concluded demands = [59, 41, 11, 14], recent mean \u224831.25. Pipeline is large (in-transit=303) and on-hand=28, so avoid inflating mean; promised lead time remains 2 and recent observed lead times vary 1\u20132 but center on 2. I set L to the promised lead time to align with the OR engine assumptions. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (keeps orders responsive to recent drop) while preventing excess inventory given large pipeline. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand) against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical lead times repeatedly confirmed as 2 periods; occasional 1 or 3 but majority support promised L=2. Recent realized demand has fallen sharply (Periods 31-34 demands = 11,14,24,26; recent avg \u224818.75) versus earlier higher regimes. Because substantial pipeline exists (335 units) and recent weeks show a new low-demand regime sustained 4 periods, I choose L=default to trust promised lead time, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (capture the current low-demand regime) so the backend will target much lower replenishment and avoid overstock while the large in-transit inventory clears. This balances service vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (large pipeline). Recent demand has settled low (last 4 demands: 14,24,26,26 \u2192 mean=22.5). Lead time historically confirmed as 2 and promised=2, so keep default L to align with contract and observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=335. Recent demand has been low the past 4 weeks (Periods 33-36 = 24,26,26,21). Historical observed lead times are mixed but previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default lead time to avoid over-adjusting from sporadic 1- or 3-period observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 demand observations to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given large in-transit. These parameters bias orders toward covering (1+L)\xd7recent mean with volatility based on recent std, balancing high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost and the large existing pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 \u2014 large pipeline already covers multiple weeks; no same-period arrivals visible yet. Observed lead times (concluded messages) show many values (15 observations, avg ~1.73) with frequent 2-period deliveries; I therefore ask backend to compute the empirical average lead time from concluded history. Demand has fallen sharply since late Aug/Sept; to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit stock, use default demand/volatility estimates (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine's capped ordering will moderate new receipts against existing pipeline. This balances service (using observed lead-time avg) versus holding cost given high in-transit quantity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg decreased from 65.67 (Periods 25-30) to 19.57 (Periods 31-37), -70.2%, sustained for 7 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a low regime (Periods 31-37 avg=19.57 units/week per carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (large pipeline). Historical lead times have varied but were previously confirmed as 2 periods; no new lead-time evidence since Period 38. To respect promised lead time while adapting to the sustained low-demand regime, I keep L at default (promised) and set demand forecasts using the recent low-regime samples (capture last 7 periods) so the OR engine reduces ordering despite large pipeline. sigma_hat also computed from the same recent 7-period window to reflect reduced volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 31 (sustained drop; P31\u2013P39). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 units (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 2 periods in history; I'll use the promised/default lead time. To align forecasting with the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N (last 9 periods, P31\u2013P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to current demand patterns while the large in-transit position reduces need for extra safety stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 31 (P31-P40 mean \u224818.6/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 (sizable pipeline). Recent lead-time confirmations point to 2 periods historically; promised lead time is 2. To reflect the new low-demand regime I use recent_N=10 for demand mean/volatility (covers P31-P40). I keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded lead-time evidence supports 2 and backend expects promised LT. Using recent_N (N=10) reduces forecasted mu and sigma to match sustained lower demand and avoids excess holding cost while pipeline (335) already covers several weeks of demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 31 (weekly demands ~9\u201326, recent 8-period avg \u224817.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 which is ample pipeline (likely covers multiple periods). No recent concluded arrivals contradict promised lead time (last confirmed lead time = 2). I therefore keep L at default (promised) to let backend assume 2. For demand I use recent_N (capture the low-demand regime) with N=8 (Periods 34\u201341) so mu_hat reflects the sustained low demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given large in-transit stock while preserving service given observed low demand and confirmed lead-time behavior.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since Period 31; mean demand over Periods 31-42 = 18.25 units/week. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u2248 promised 2 periods; I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). Using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current low-demand regime while avoiding stale high-season samples. On-hand 0 + in-transit 335 >> expected (1+L)*mean = 3*18.25 = 54.75, so pipeline is ample; this reduces the need for aggressive safety stock and limits holding cost exposure.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=335. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 in multiple periods and a pronounced, sustained low-demand regime since Period 31 (avg \u224819.6 over P31-P37 and continuing through P43). Pipeline (335) already covers multiple weeks; to avoid overstocking I keep promised lead time but forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (use promised 2). Use recent_N for demand (N=13) to capture the sustained low-demand regime from P31\u2013P43. Use recent_N for sigma (N=13) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock and cap orders, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the new low-demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has been low since Period 31 (periods 31-44 mean ~16), with prior carry-over insight confirming a large drop in demand (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=335 units \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks given low recent demand. Lead time has been observed as 2 in multiple concluded periods; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change in the last 3+ periods. To avoid overreacting to short noise while the pipeline clears, use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its historical-average base-stock and caps accounting for L. This balances service level given a large in-transit position against holding cost risk.

Demand has been in the low regime since ~Period 31 (sustained through Period 45); to reflect the recent low-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 15 periods. Use default volatility to let backend scale by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep orders aligned with the sustained lower demand while the large in-transit stock prevents stockouts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 31 (avg \u224815.8 over P31\u2013P46). Lead-time history shows mixed 1\u20133 with mean \u22481.77; prior carry-over confirmed sustained LT=2 in earlier windows but more recent variability exists. I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; for demand I use recent_N with N=7 to target the most recent low-demand regime (regime length 7 around Periods 31\u201337) and reduce forecast to current environment; sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps safety stock aligned with current low demand while acknowledging observed lead-time variability and protecting against stockouts given 2-period promised lead time.
