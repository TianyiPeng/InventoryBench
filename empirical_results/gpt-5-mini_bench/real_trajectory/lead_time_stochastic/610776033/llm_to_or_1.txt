Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples: [0,0,24,58,84] (mean=33.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments. Promised lead time = 2 periods. Profit and holding cost equal \u2192 service quantile q=0.5 so z*=0, making base_stock = mu_hat; using default methods keeps forecast anchored to full-sample mean times (1+L). I choose default L (promised), default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service vs. holding cost given limited data and no confirmed regime shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand shows an upward shift: historical weekly samples = [0,0,24,58,84] and last concluded period demand=129, indicating demand increasing. The order placed in Period 1 (95) has not concluded yet; insufficient concluded evidence to change promised lead time (do not infer longer lead time). Therefore keep L as default (promised=2). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach focusing on the most recent regime (last 3 meaningful samples: 24,58,84) because mean has clearly risen versus earlier zeros; set mu_hat recent_N N=3 to capture this uptick. Volatility similarly uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to better cover higher recent demand while keeping lead time conservative given lack of arrival confirmation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=245; two recent orders (P1,P2) have not concluded (arrived=0) but we have only two missed arrivals \u2014 insufficient to confirm a persistent lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) show a recent rising trend but no 3+ period sustained regime shift. To avoid overreacting to potentially transient delays, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service vs holding cost while waiting for more conclusive arrival evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (Periods1-3) shows a strong upward shift vs. older samples (demands: 129, 268, 233 vs. historical Jan samples 0,0,24,58,84). Orders placed in Periods1\u20132 have not concluded by their expected windows, indicating actual lead time is longer than promised or shipments lost. To protect service given the clear demand regime shift and delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly higher to cover the uncertainty and use recent_N=3 for demand mean/volatility (uses the three most recent periods: 129, 268, 233) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated demand. This biases the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while acknowledging holding cost via the capped order. 

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 1 (95) and Period 2 (150) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 evidence of lead-time > promised 2 or lost shipments; recent demand regime shift: Periods 1-3 mean=210 (129,268,233).

Daily Profit: $150.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand shows a higher regime (Period1-4 demands: 129, 268, 233, 174; recent mean ~201). Pipeline shows in-transit=424 but on-hand=0; one prior order (P1:95) still not concluded, indicating possible lost shipment but P2 arrival (150) confirms lead time = 2 for that shipment. I keep L as default (promised 2) because we have at least one confirmed 2-period arrival and no sustained evidence of a different lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new, higher-demand regime (N=4 = recent regime length). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the elevated recent demand while using the promised lead time; they help balance service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent history shows high demand in Periods 1-3 (mean \u2248210) then moderate declines in P4-5 (174,160). Period 4 conclude confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=603 (large pipeline). I use default lead time (promised 2) since recent concluded evidence confirms L=2 and missing shipments earlier resolved. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample stats scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance to balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding (q\u22480.5). This avoids overreacting to a short 2-period softening in demand while accounting for the substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand 0, in-transit 424. History shows variable observed lead times (one arrival with LT=2, one with LT=1) and demand recent sequence (Periods 4-6: 174,160,207). I choose to let backend estimate L from observed lead times (method=calculate) to capture the recent variability rather than lock to promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 4-6). Similarly use recent_N (N=3) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting current-week demand spikes while avoiding excessive holdings given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: one order had lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) and one had lead_time=1 (P5\u2192P6); some earlier orders remain unconfirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=541. Demand has shifted to a higher regime recently (last 3 demands: P5=160, P6=207, P7=221; mean\u2248196). To balance service vs holding cost under uncertain/variable lead times, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend average observed LT). For demand forecast I use the most recent 3 periods to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L) scaling applied by backend). For demand volatility I also use the last 3 samples. These choices make the OR engine respond to the recent upward demand while letting the backend estimate effective lead time from observed arrivals and cap orders to avoid overstock if some shipments are lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand shows rising weekly sales (last 5 demands: 174,160,207,221,245) after earlier high-demand periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=471 (sizable pipeline). Lead times have been variable recently (observed lead_times: 2,1,1). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding cost so q=0.5), I use a short recent-average lead time (recent_N) to reflect faster deliveries seen in the last 3 observed arrivals, and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand points to capture the recent upward regime. These parameters keep orders responsive to current demand while avoiding excess inventory given substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time variability observed: orders (P2->P4)=2, (P5->P6)=1, (P7->P8)=1 -> recent avg 1.33 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the last 3 observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 5-9) so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of current demand while sigma reflects recent volatility; this balances service-level (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent observed lead-times show variability but average ~1.33 (recent observed LT sequence: 1,2,1). Recent demand higher than early periods \u2014 last 4 demands (Periods 7-10) = [221,245,187,252], mean\u2248226.25. To capture recent lead-time variability I set L using recent_N over the last 3 observed lead-times (avg \u22481.33). For demand I use recent_N over the last 4 demand samples to reflect the recent elevated regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward relative to the long-run mean to avoid stockouts given variable/shorter recent lead times while controlling holding cost by using a limited recent sample rather than all historical data.

On-hand=0, in-transit=679 (large pipeline, several recent arrivals confirming variable lead times: observed lead times sequence (P2->P4)=2, (P5->P6)=1, (P7->P8)=1, (P8->P10)=2, (P9->P10)=1). Because lead time has been variable but recent short (mix of 1s and 2s), I set L via recent_N to capture the last 3 observed lead times (preserves responsiveness to short lead times while acknowledging occasional 2-period delays). Demand mean/volatility are recalculated from the most recent stable high-demand regime (last 5 demand observations) using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated weekly demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent demand has been consistently high (last 12-week mean ~215 units/week) with no on-hand stock and 695 units in-transit. Lead times have varied recently (observed sequence 2,1,1,2,1); to prioritize recent behavior I set L using the average of the last 3 observed lead times (avg=1.33). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances higher recent demand against holding cost given lead-time uncertainty.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent observed lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.33; demand last 5 periods = [187,252,253,246,147] (recent mean \u2248217) and volatility visible across those 5. On-hand=101 + in-transit=447 gives ample pipeline but lead-time has shortened recently, so reduce assumed L to the recent average. Choices: L by recent_N N=3 to capture the most recent lead-time regime; mu_hat by recent_N N=5 to reflect the recent demand level (1+L scaling applied by backend); sigma_hat by recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk given shorter observed lead times while keeping service for recent demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=3, in-transit=534 (large pipeline). Observed lead times recent series = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2]; recent behavior shows average < promised 2 but variable \u2014 choose a recent average to reflect current variability. Demand has moved to a higher regime (many periods with 147\u2013253); use recent samples to capture current mean/volatility rather than early low outliers. Set L as recent_N over last 5 observed lead times to downweight old missing shipments while reflecting variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N over last 7 demand samples to target the current high-demand regime and capture recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend a forecast centered on recent realized demand and a lead-time that reflects shorter recent arrivals, reducing overstock risk given the already-large in-transit pipeline.

Recent observed lead-times show variability (sequence last observed: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2) \u2014 recent average ~1.6; no clear sustained shift from promised 2. Recent demand (~Periods 11-15) is lower than early spikes; using recent window to capture current regime. Set L via recent_N to reflect recent observed lead-time mix.

Recent concluded lead times show variability but recent sequence (P11->P13=2, P12->P14=2, P8->P10=2) supports using a short-term average \u22482. Recent demand (Periods 12-16 = 246,147,114,138,125) indicates a lower regime than early spikes; use recent_N=5 to capture current mean and volatility. Set L by recent lead-time average (N=5) to reflect observed deliveries and reduce risk of underordering when shipments can be 2 periods. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures current demand regime: mean\u2248154 per period, scaled by (1+L) in OR). These choices aim to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand given on-hand=0 and large in-transit, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent weekly demands have been high and variable (historic samples: 129,268,233,174,160,207,221,245,187,252,253,246,147,114,138,125,219). On-hand=0, in-transit=534 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to typical weekly demand and should cover upcoming periods even with L\u22482. Observed lead times have varied; I use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times. For demand parameters I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This avoids overfitting to recent noise while the large in-transit position reduces stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has recently returned to ~2 periods: observed P11->P13 (2), P12->P14 (2), P15->P17 (2).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=534. Recent concluded lead-times show consistency around 2 periods (Periods 11->13,12->14,15->17). Recent demand has increased versus early-sample baseline: last 5 concluded demands = [114,138,125,219,262] (Periods 14-18) indicating a higher recent mean and elevated volatility. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (2) because recent concluded observations support ~2. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 5 periods). For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect the elevated recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the (L+1) review horizon under the current higher-demand regime while using recent volatility for an appropriate safety stock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has jumped: last 5 period demands = [138,125,219,262,371], recent mean ~223 which is well above earlier lows. On-hand=0, in-transit=534 (sufficient pipeline cover but arrivals have shown variable lead times; recent concluded lead times cluster at 2). To be responsive to the elevated recent demand while protecting against holding cost, I use a recent-window demand estimate (captures the new higher regime) and recent-window volatility. For lead time I ask the backend to calculate average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (uses empirical evidence). These settings prioritize service (capture current higher mean) but keep volatility and lead-time empirical so the OR cap limits excessive ordering and reduces holding risk.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=669. Recent demand has stepped up sharply (Periods 16-20: 125, 219, 262, 371, 306) indicating a higher-demand regime vs earlier periods. Lead-time observations through Period 18 indicate LT \u2248 2 most recently, so use promised lead time to align with OR engine assumptions. To capture the recent demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last five periods) so the backend's (1+L) demand forecast and variability reflect the elevated demand and short-term volatility. This balances higher service-level needs (avoid stockouts given substantial in-transit but long sequencing) against holding cost by not over-smoothing with older low-demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): On-hand=0, in-transit=770. Recent demand has stepped up: last 4 demands (Periods 18-21) = [262, 371, 306, 320], avg \u2248 314.8. Recent observed lead-times (concluded history) show variability but have returned to mostly 2 in recent history; using an observed-average lead time avoids overtrusting the promised value while reflecting variability. I set L by observed-average (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N (N=4) forecast to capture the new higher regime; same recent_N (N=4) for sigma to reflect current volatility. With in-transit=770 and (1+L)\xd7recent demand \u2248 (1+avg_LT)\xd7315 \u2248 similar magnitude, this avoids over-ordering while aiming to cover the new higher demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=810. Recent demand has risen since Period 18 (five-period mean 298 units/week); promised lead time = 2 and recent arrivals (P20->P22) support L=2. Pipeline (810) slightly under (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 894, so use a recent_N demand estimate to reflect the new higher regime and recent volatility for safety. Methods chosen: L=default to respect promised lead time (supported by recent confirms); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period20 order arrived Period22); Demand regime shift starting Period18: avg demand Period18-22 = 298 units/week (262,371,306,320,231).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has shifted higher starting Period 18: Period18-22 avg=298/wk; latest weeks (P22-23) demand 231,272 confirming elevated regime. Recent concluded lead-time observations consistently show 2 periods (multiple P->P+2 arrivals through Period 23). Current inventory: on-hand=4, in-transit=618 (large pipeline). Decision: use L=default to trust promised lead time=2 (supported by recent confirms). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures Period18-22 elevated regime mean) so base_stock reflects (1+L)*recent mean demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This balances service (meet the new higher demand) while backend cap and large in-transit reduce excessive ordering and holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent sustained demand regime since Period 18: avg \u2248298 units/week (Periods 18-22) and continued high demand through Period 24. On-hand=0, in-transit=896 \u2014 roughly equals 3*(~298)=894 so pipeline roughly covers (1+L) periods. Lead time has been confirmed at 2 periods in recent history; use promised/default L. Use recent_N (N=7, Periods18-24) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (regime length=7). This keeps base_stock aligned to current demand while sigma from recent data controls safety stock to limit holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand regime (starting P18) elevated: Period18-25 demands = [262,371,306,320,231,229,175,175] (recent average ~262 over last 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=896 \u2014 with promised L=2, (1+L)=3, 3\xd7recent mean (~786) is covered by pipeline (896), so no upward correction needed. Lead time history recently stable at 2 periods (multiple confirmed P->P+2 observations), so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the post-P18 regime while reflecting recent softening. These parameters balance service (keep enough pipeline to cover ~3 weeks of elevated demand) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts beyond observed recent mean/volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=812. Recent history shows lead time has been behaving ~2 periods (confirmed in prior conclude messages) but with variability; I will trust the promised lead time this period. Demand has declined from the high regime around Periods 18-22 (avg ~298) to lower recent weekly demand (Periods 22-26 = 231,272,229,175,171). To capture the most recent demand level and volatility I use a recent_N forecast based on the last 5 demand samples (responsive to the recent downshift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices bias orders toward current lower demand while keeping lead time at the promised value to avoid over-ordering given pipeline of 812 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=812. Recent concluded lead times vary but have repeatedly been 2 in prior windows and there is no sustained, convincing break in lead time; use promised/default lead time to avoid overreacting to sporadic 1s and a single 3. Demand recent history (Periods 1-27) mean \u2248215 units/week; with L=default (promised 2) the backend's default (1+L)\xd7mean gives a replenishment covering 3 weeks. Pipeline (812) already exceeds 3\xd7mean (~646), so no aggressive upward adjustment needed. I select default methods so the OR engine applies its calibrated base-stock formula while acknowledging a recent downward demand trend in carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period24: avg demand Period24-27 = 183.25 (229,175,171,158) vs prior Period18-22 avg = 298 (262,371,306,320,231) \u2192 decline \u2248 -38.6%

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has declined from the higher regime (Periods 18-22 avg ~298) to a lower regime starting Period 24: Periods 24-27 demand = [229,175,171,158], avg=183.25; Period 28 demand=194. On-hand=0, in-transit=812 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2. I choose L='default' (use promised 2) because recent concluded arrivals mostly align with 2 and OR backend expects promised L; mu_hat set using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples Period24-27). sigma_hat set recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the new regime. This keeps forecast and safety stock tied to the confirmed lower demand while the large in-transit reduces additional ordering risk.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime observed starting Period 24 (Period24-29 demands = 229,175,171,158,194,178; mean \u2248184). Lead-time observations since Period18/23 confirm lead time \u22482 periods and no new sustained lead-time shift is evident, so use promised/default lead time. On-hand is 0 but in-transit = 812 units (large pipeline) \u2014 we should forecast demand using recent samples to avoid overstocking. Therefore: L=default (promised 2); mu_hat uses recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-Period24 lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to earlier high-demand regime and rely on the large in-transit pipeline to cover short-term demand while avoiding additional ordering driven by outdated high-demand averages.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 24 (avg ~183/week vs prior ~298/week); on-hand=0, in-transit=812. Recent concluded lead-time observations around Periods 20-23 confirm typical lead_time \u2248 2. Given no new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes since the last recorded insights, use promised lead time and default demand estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over historical samples. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=812 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the lower demand. No new sustained lead-time change detected. Set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the confirmed lower regime (Periods 24\u201331, N=8).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=812. Historical concluded lead-times vary (observed leads: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3 -> avg \u22481.73). Recent demand has declined vs earlier spike: last 5 demands (Periods28-32)=194,178,117,109,83 -> mean\u2248136.2, lower than the Period24-27 regime (~183). To capture the recent downward demand trend I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts for the near-term (review+lead) demand; for lead time I use a calculated average of observed lead times to reflect historical variability (~1.7 periods) rather than blindly trusting promised=2. This balances service level (protect against lead-time variability) while avoiding excessive stock for the recent lower demand regime. No immediate flags of lost shipment beyond historical variability given many in-transit units (812) already cover multiple periods.

Recent demand has declined from earlier regime: last 6 observed demands (Periods 28-33) = [194,178,117,109,83,117], mean\u2248133. Given large existing pipeline, avoid inflating orders \u2014 use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent 6 weeks to capture the lower regime. Select recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand regime, reducing risk of excess holding while still covering near-term demand.

Lead time has repeatedly been ~2 in recent concluded history and promised lead time is 2. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (last 11 samples Period24-34) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of recent regime; use the same recent_N window for volatility (sigma) to reflect recent variance. This balances service (match current lower demand) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 (samples P24\u2013P35 show sustained lower weekly sales vs earlier peak). On-hand=0, in-transit=812 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead-time observations center on 2 periods; use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use recent_N over the current low-demand regime (Periods 24\u201335, length=12) to capture the sustained downshift. Set sigma_hat using the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the lower demand regime while accounting for the long in-transit pipeline to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last 7 weeks (Periods 30-36). On-hand=0, in-transit=812 \u2014 large pipeline that will cover multiple weeks even if OR orders more. Lead-time evidence historically variable but recently centers on promised 2; no new sustained lead-time change. I set L=default to let backend assume promised 2. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (last 7 observed weeks) so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding given high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period30: avg Period30-36 = 82 units/week vs prior Period24-27 avg = 183.25 (\u2248 -55%), sustained for 7 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized since Period 30: last 8 weeks (P30-37) demand = [117,109,83,117,68,49,31,49], mean = 77.875/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=812 \u2014 pipeline is very large relative to recent demand (812 covers ~10.4 weeks at recent mean). Historical concluded lead times have repeatedly shown ~2 in recent history; no new sustained lead-time change. I therefore keep promised lead time (default) and bias demand estimates to the recent low regime: use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower mean and reduced volatility. This avoids over-ordering despite large in-transit stock because the OR backend will cap orders; using recent demand reduces target base stock and holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time recently confirmed as 2 periods in earlier history and appears stable. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (the length of the recent low-demand regime) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculated from the most recent 7 demand samples, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (Period30-39 demands: 117,109,83,117,68,49,31,49,27,26; avg \u2248 69). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=812 units provides substantial pipeline cover. Lead time history has varied but has several confirmations at 2; use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions consistent. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (regime length=10) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; this lowers target base-stock and reduces risk of excess holding given holding cost equals profit. These choices help the OR backend reduce orders while current large in-transit inventory is consumed.

Historical concluded lead-times recently centered on promised 2 periods and no new sustained LT change; use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent low-demand regime (recent_N N=11) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current low mean and reduced volatility, avoiding excess holding given large in-transit stock.

No new confirmed lead-time change; use promised lead time. To align base-stock to the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime data (last 12 periods, Periods 30\u201341).

Lead time observations across history repeatedly confirm ~2 periods; no new sustained lead-time change. I set L to default (promised 2). I use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (N equals regime length since Period30). This reduces target base stock to align orders with the lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given Profit=Holding=$1/unit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 37: last 7 periods (P37- P43) avg demand \u224838 units/week. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=812 units (covers many weeks at current demand). Lead-time observations have varied historically but recent confirmations support the promised 2-period service; no new sustained LT change. To avoid overstocking given the large pipeline and weak recent demand, set L to default (promised=2) so backend uses nominal lead time. Forecast demand using the most recent 7-week regime (captures the sustained low-demand pattern); use recent_N N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 7 samples. This reduces target base-stock to reflect the new low-demand regime and prevents excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has been in the low regime since ~Period 37 (sustained: Periods 38-44 demands = 27,26,25,12,64,63,12; avg \u224832.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=812 \u2014 with promised L=2, coverage target (1+L) periods \xd7 recent mean \u22483\xd732.7\u224898 units, so pipeline (812) is ample and suggests no immediate replenishment needed. Lead time has multiple confirmations at 2 periods in history; I therefore keep L as default (promised). To align the backend forecast to the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7-period low-demand regime). This reduces overstating demand and lowers orders/holding cost while preserving service.

Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period30; last 16 demands (P30\u2013P45) avg = 53.69 units/week, so (1+L)=3 demand across review+lead \u2248161 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=812 \u2014 pipeline >> forecasted demand for coming (1+L) periods, so no aggressive replenishment. Lead time has been confirmed at ~2 in recent history, so use promised/default L=2. Use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and recent variance; this keeps base-stock low (reduces holding cost) while the large in-transit pipeline preserves service.

Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (sustained through Period 46; avg \u224882 over P30\u2013P36 and continued low volumes P37\u2013P46). Concluded lead-time history mostly supports the promised 2-period lead time and no new sustained change in lead time is evident. To align the OR engine with the sustained low-demand regime I set L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N using the most recent regime samples (N=17 covering Periods 30\u201346) so the forecast (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current low demand, and sigma_hat=recent_N N=17 to capture current volatility. This reduces excess ordering against the large in-transit pipeline and balances service level vs. holding cost.
