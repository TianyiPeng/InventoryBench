Recent arrivals predominantly have 1-period actual lead time, but this is not yet a 3+ period confirmed shift, so do not record a lead-time change. Step 2 - Inventory / pipeline: On-hand = 126. In-transit = 482, but 292 of that is the flagged lost Period1 order per carry-over insight, so treat reliable pipeline = 482 - 292 = 190 (the Period8 order). Reliable pipeline + on-hand = 316. Step 3 - Demand stats (OR data reproduced): sample mean \u03bc\u0304 = 185.4 units/period, sample sd \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 64.2.

Step 5 - Strategy summary: We increase OR's capped recommendation (51) to 291 because OR counts the lost Period1 shipment in in-transit, making its effective pipeline appear larger; after excluding the confirmed-lost 292 units the pipeline is much smaller and we need to order up to the cap to cover expected (L+1)-period demand with 95% service.
