Current inventory picture: on-hand=0, in-transit=418. Some of that in-transit likely corresponds to unconcluded/lost shipments (evidence: earlier orders that never concluded), but 418 units is still a large pipeline relative to recent realized demand. Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand has fallen sharply from ~90\u2013100 in March/April down to 35\u201375 in May\u2013June (last five concluded demands: 73,83,94,72,43,47,35), indicating a lower-demand regime vs. the Jan historical samples (\u2248130). OR recommends 0 units using promised L and historical high-demand samples; given confirmed lead-time behavior and evidence of lost shipments, ordering risks either adding to pipeline that may be lost or creating excess holding cost if shipments arrive.

Current visible concluded messages (through Period 20) show no recent arrivals, but the system reports In-transit=418 (units from prior orders that have not yet concluded). This pipeline is therefore uncertain: units may still arrive or be lost; we cannot assume timely arrival until a conclude message appears. Demand outlook: recent weekly demands have trended sharply down since spring (most recent demands: 73, 83, 94, 72, 43, 47, 35, 27), consistent with seasonality for lightweight nightwear entering summer (Period date 2019-07-01). Cost balance: profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period favors stocking when demand justifies, but with low observed demand and a large uncertain pipeline, ordering risks incurring holding costs if in-transit arrives. OR recommends 0 units (uses promised LT and full history); given the low recent demand, summer seasonal lull, and substantial in-transit inventory (418) that may still arrive, it is prudent to follow OR and place no new order this period. This avoids overstocking if the in-transit shipment concludes and minimizes holding cost while we wait for conclude messages to confirm actual arrivals.
