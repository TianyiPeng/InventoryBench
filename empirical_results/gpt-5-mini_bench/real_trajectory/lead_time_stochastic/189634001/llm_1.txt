{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (between Xmas and New Year) \u2014 apparel demand remains elevated (holiday season spillover). Product: leggings (basic garment) likely steady weekly demand. Demand regime: recent concluded demand has been high: P42=175, P43=116, P45=166, P46=121 \u2192 short-term weekly demand \u2248130. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2 but historical actuals vary 1\u20133 and some earlier shipments were lost/delayed; therefore treat large in-transit =970 as unreliable for planning. Inventory assessment: on-hand=43; to cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand at 130/week requires \u2248390 units. Subtract on-hand (43) \u2192 net need \u2248347. Holding cost = profit ($1/unit/period) so avoid large overstock; but risk of delayed arrivals argues to order to cover 3-week exposure. Order decision: place 350 units to replenish buffer while limiting excess holding cost.",
