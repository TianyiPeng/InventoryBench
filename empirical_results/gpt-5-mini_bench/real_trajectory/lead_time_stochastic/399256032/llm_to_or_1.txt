Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 399256032 has zero on-hand and in-transit; no conclude messages to infer lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show a rising trend but only 5 points\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime change. Promised lead time is 2 periods; use default lead time so OR backend assumes promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine compute base stock while avoiding overfitting to the short upward trend. This balances service level vs holding cost given limited data and no evidence of delayed/lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u224886.8 units/week; Period 1 demand =113. On-hand=0, in-transit=148 (order placed Period 1) but arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change. I choose L=default (use promised 2-period lead time). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level driven by profit/holding cost while keeping parameters conservative until arrivals confirm actual lead time or a demand regime shift. No explicit increase in forecast despite recent higher demand because evidence is limited to one high week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=297 (matches orders 148+149). No concluded arrivals yet for prior orders; this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (orders placed in P1/P2 would arrive during P3 and be observed in P4 conclude). No strong, sustained demand regime change detected: historical weekly samples show a rising trend but only 5 older samples plus two recent demands (113,124) \u2014 insufficient to declare a new regime. Therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling on full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L) on std, letting the backend balance service level vs. holding cost using the given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand shows an upward shift (samples: 75, 99, 145). All three past orders (P1..P3) have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating actual lead time exceeds the promised 2 periods. To be conservative I set L=3 (explicit). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline and higher recent demand while the OR engine applies its service-level cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2 periods: orders placed in Periods 1-3 remained unarrived in their conclude messages (P1 ordered on P1 not arrived by P3 conclude; P2 and P3 also not concluded), indicating a sustained delay across three periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed lead time = 2 (P2 order arrived in P4 with lead_time=2) while earlier orders were delayed but P4 conclude restored arrival; on-hand=55, in-transit=318 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand samples (mean of provided samples = 86.8/week). I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses confirmed observations only). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding costs given current high pipeline and one confirmed lead-time=2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5) = [113,124,94,94,67], recent mean=98.4/wk. On-hand 0 + in-transit 318 units. Historical samples (2019 Jan) show lower baseline but recent weeks are higher. Concluded messages show delayed shipments (orders from P1\u2013P3 did not conclude; P2 arrived with lead_time=2), indicating actual lead time > promised 2. Pipeline (318) likely undercovers forecast for (1+L) periods: with L\u22483 and recent mean ~98.4, (1+L)*mean\u2248393.6 required, so recommend planning for longer lead time and using recent demand for mu and sigma to avoid stockouts. Selected L explicit=3 to be conservative given sustained delays; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent elevated demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent variability. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical weekly samples show mean\u224886.8; with promised L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods (3\xd7mean\u2248260). Current pipeline (431) comfortably exceeds that forecast so no immediate replenishment required. Conclude history contains a confirmed 2-period arrival (P2\u2192P4) and some delayed/no-show periods earlier, but evidence is mixed and not a sustained >2-period lead-time shift. Therefore keep L at the promised/default, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This balances service level (pipeline > forecast) against holding cost risk from the large in-transit volume.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent observed weekly demand is higher than the Jan samples (recent demands: P1-7 demands = [113,124,94,94,67,95,133]) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Concluded arrivals show at least one confirmed lead_time=2 (order in P2 arrived in P4) but multiple earlier orders remained unarrived for several periods, signaling uncertainty/delays. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time (reflects confirmed lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher recent regime across the last 7 samples; same N used for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock toward recent higher demand while keeping lead-time anchored to confirmed observations, helping the OR engine balance service-level vs holding cost given in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2 periods: orders placed in Periods 1-3 remained unarrived through Period 3 conclude (sustained delay across three periods); one confirmed arrival shows lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=7, in-transit=318. Recent concluded arrivals show consistent 2-period lead time (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). Demand last 8 periods: [113,124,94,94,67,95,133,106] (avg\u2248101) \u2014 use recent data to reflect current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture current mean/volatility over the review+lead window and avoid older Jan samples skewing forecast. This balances service (cover ~L+1 periods of ~101 mean demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent realized lead times have been consistent with 2 periods (confirmed P2\u2192P4 and P6\u2192P8). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=333 (covers expected future demand under L=2). Recent demand has settled near ~96 units/week (Periods 5\u20139: 67,95,133,106,81, mean=96.4). To respond to this recent regime while respecting the promised lead time, I set L to default (promised=2). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level across the review+lead horizon ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands \u2248 3\xd796.4). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the backend uses recent volatility for safety stock sizing. These choices prioritize meeting service with moderate safety stock while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (q=0.8 encourages service).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has averaged ~98 units/week (Periods 6-10: 95,133,106,81,76). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times: observed 2,2,1 \u2192 mixed but average >1. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times; mu_hat set to recent_N (N=5) to focus on the most recent regime (captures current ~98/wk demand); sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps orders aligned with recent demand while letting the backend account for inferred lead-time via calculate; large in-transit means orders will be capped by pipeline so aggressive ordering is avoided.

Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 observed demands (P7-P11) = [133,106,81,76,74], mean=94. On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (sizable pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in prior concludes, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect recent regime and avoid overstocking given high pipeline, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (3-period coverage \u2192 (1+L)=3 \xd7 recent mean) and capture recent variability with sigma_hat recent_N=5. This balances service (covers ~3 periods of recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent conclude messages show observed lead_times = {P2\u2192P4:2, P6\u2192P8:2, P9\u2192P10:1} so actual lead time fluctuates but average \u22481.67; on-hand=0, in-transit=328 (large pipeline). To avoid over-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory and to let the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead time, I set L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand history (baseline samples) mean \u224886.8; using mu_hat='default' lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean without overreacting to short-term noise. Volatility will be handled by sigma_hat='default' so the backend uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination relies on the large existing pipeline to suppress new orders while reflecting the (slightly <2) realized lead time in the backend's base-stock calculation.

Concluded arrivals show lead times mostly 2 but one 1; I use a recent average for L to reflect slight variation. I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime (Periods 6-13) so the OR engine sets base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering need.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been volatile but generally in the 50\u2013100/week range; on-hand=0, in-transit=318. Concluded lead-time observations: P2\u2192P4=2, P6\u2192P8=2, P9\u2192P10=1, P11\u2192P13=2 => evidence of mostly 2-period lead time with one 1-period outlier. I choose L=calculate so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 2-dominant pattern). With on-hand=0 and substantial in-transit, use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding (q=0.8) and lets the OR engine apply its capping logic using historical variability. This approach is conservative about lead time while letting the OR engine determine safety stock from full-sample demand stats.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 4\u201316) shows a higher and fairly stable weekly demand profile vs early samples; to capture current regime I use a recent-window demand estimate. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 4\u201316) so the (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std reflect the most recent demand regime and the observed pipeline; this balances service (using recent higher mean) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has averaged ~60-80/week (recent weeks: 58,65,80,65, previous: 66,85,76,81...), on-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead times support a 2-period lead time (multiple P\u2192P+2 observations); no new sustained lead-time shift observed. Pipeline (318) is large relative to recent weekly demand; with L\u22482 we need coverage \u22483 weeks. I choose to infer L from observed lead times (calculate) to reflect concluded evidence; use a recent_N=5 demand window for mu_hat to target the immediate post-regime demand level and keep responsiveness to recent weeks; use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings aim to keep the base-stock responsive to the current lower demand regime while letting the large in-transit pipeline deplete before issuing more stock, reducing holding cost risk.

Concluded lead times mostly 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13) with one short arrival (P9\u2192P10=1); overall recent evidence supports ~2-period behavior so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand has been lower than early-sample winter spikes; to reflect current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures last 5 realized demands: P14\u2013P18). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to current lower demand while the calculated L reconciles mixed arrival history and helps the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods.

On-hand=0, in-transit=318 \u2014 substantial pipeline but recent conclude messages (Periods14-19) show no arrivals, consistent with previous intermittent delays though multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=2. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent mix of 1s and 2s). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) using all historical samples; this is conservative given limited clear regime shifts and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost while respecting the computed lead-time estimate.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent demand has declined from spring peaks to low weekly sales (Periods 16-20 demands = 80,65,51,33,28). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show multiple 2-period observations; promised lead time=2. To avoid over-ordering given a heavy pipeline and falling demand, keep L as default (promised=2) and base forecast on the most recent demand regime. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (captures latest low-demand regime: mean\u224851.4 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248154 units) and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces risk of excess inventory while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula; using recent data prioritizes service for current demand levels and limits holding cost exposure given large in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=318. Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks to low summer levels (last 5 observed demands: Periods 17-21 = 65, 51, 33, 28, 20; mean \u2248 39.4). Lead time has previously been confirmed as 2 periods, so use promised/default. To avoid overstock while covering the (1+L) review+lead window under current low-demand regime, set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the sustained lower mean/variance rather than older high-winter samples. These parameters bias the OR engine toward lower base stock and lower cap, reducing holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent demand has fallen substantially versus early-period peak (recent 9 demands avg \u2248 48 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers several weeks. Observed concluded lead times include multiple 2-period observations (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13) and one 1-period (P9\u2192P10); average observed lead time is near 2. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine learns the empirical average. For demand I focus on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=9) to capture the last 9 weeks (reduces influence of earlier high winter/spring spikes). Sigma set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect current lower volatility. These choices keep orders conservative given large in-transit inventory and lower current demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead-times show consistent 2-period arrivals (confirmed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, earlier evidence), so use default promised L. Demand has declined from spring levels to a lower stable regime since ~Period 14; to reflect the recent lower demand we set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent ~10 periods (Period 14\u201323) to capture the current mean and volatility. Using recent_N focuses orders to match current demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4. The chosen settings help the OR backend target service with lower safety stock appropriate for the sustained lower-demand regime while respecting the lead-time behavior seen in concluded messages.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been low (last weeks: 58,12) after earlier spring peaks; current on-hand=0, in-transit=318 which likely covers multiple weeks given typical demand. Historical concluded lead-times are predominantly 2 periods (several P->P+2 observations) so keep promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility estimation so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples; this balances service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) without overreacting to recent low weeks while respecting confirmed L=2 and existing large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead times are predominantly 2 periods (several P\u2192P+2 confirmations) so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has fallen from the Jan peak; last 6 realized weekly demands (Periods 20-25) = [28,20,33,58,12,30], signaling a lower demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to anchor forecasts to the latest regime and avoid overstock given holding cost >0. This keeps L conservative (default=promised 2) while the recent-based mean/volatility will temper orders despite large in-transit pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded history repeatedly shows lead_time = 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8) with one 1-period anomaly (P9\u2192P10); on-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline). No new sustained demand regime shift; pipeline already large so rely on backend's default estimates using promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for transient anomalies. Chosen: L=default to keep promised 2; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (uses full-sample demand) with holding cost while respecting large existing in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to low summer levels (many periods of low single-digit to low-double-digit demand after Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show multiple consistent 2-period observations; use promised/default lead time. Use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this lets the engine account for the large pipeline while keeping service-level math consistent with observed lead time=2.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent weekly demand has been well below earlier winter/spring peaks \u2014 sustained low regime from ~Period 14 through Period 28 (demands mostly 12\u201380, recent weeks ~25\u201340). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 in past; no recent evidence of change, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 15 periods (captures Periods 14\u201328 regime length \u224815) so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate to lower demand while the large in-transit reduces new orders risk.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded lead-times show multiple 2-period arrivals (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13) and Period 9 previously confirmed lead_time=2; I therefore use the promised/default lead time. Recent realized demand (last 6 observed weekly demands: Periods 24-29 = 12,30,25,34,38,25) indicates a lower, stable summer demand regime vs. the early high winter samples. To keep pipeline coverage = (1+L) periods while reacting to the recent regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 6 demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given current in-transit stock of 318 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Recent observed demand (Periods 26-30) = [25,34,38,25,30], mean\u224830; historical early-season samples were higher but recent steady lower demand. Conclude there is a persistent problem with late/missing arrivals (many orders remained in-transit long after promised lead time). To protect service while accounting for delayed/lost shipments, set lead time explicitly longer than promised so the OR engine targets more pipeline coverage. Chosen methods: L explicit=4 to conservatively cover observed prolonged delays; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the most recent stable demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples \xd7 (1+L)); sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent observed volatility. This balances service level (by increasing target pipeline via longer L and recent demand mean) against holding cost by using recent demand rather than historical peak values.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments persistent since Period 10: no arrivals observed from orders placed after Period 9 through Period 30 despite in-transit=318, indicating likely lost or severely delayed shipments (evidence: zero 'arrived' in conclude messages P10\u2013P30 while in-transit remains large).

To avoid overreacting to potentially lost shipments (which the OR engine cannot detect), use default methods so the backend applies the promised lead time and full historical demand stats for supply decisions while keeping safety via the engine's cap.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical conclude messages show lead-time volatility earlier but lead_time=2 confirmed in multiple earlier conclues; long window (Periods 10\u201330) of zero arrivals despite large in-transit suggests many shipments lost/delayed. To be conservative I keep lead time = 2 (explicit). Demand shows a sustained lower regime after the spring sell-throughs; I detect a changepoint around Period 9 with ~24 periods in the recent regime. I therefore use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the most recent demand regime (caps N at 20). These choices aim to match the current lower demand profile while the explicit L=2 aligns with confirmed lead-time evidence; using recent data reduces overstating demand given long intervals of zero arrivals/sales.

On-hand=0, in-transit=318 with many orders placed earlier but no recent arrivals since Period 13, indicating persistent missing/delayed shipments though some historical concludes show lead_time=1\u20132. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (leveraging confirmed W=2,2,1,2) rather than blindly trusting promised lead time; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to base demand forecast on all available historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because recent demand shows no sustained upward regime shift and available sample set is limited. This balances service level (using observed lead-time evidence) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and likely lost shipments.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 but historical conclude messages P10\u2013P34 show zero arrivals (likely lost/severely delayed shipments). Lead-time evidence is mixed: confirmed 2-period arrivals earlier (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8) but many subsequent orders never concluded. To be consistent with promised lead time while acknowledging recent low observed demand, I keep L at the promised/default value. For demand I rely on the most recent stable observations (Periods 30\u201334: demands 30,34,30,38,36) to capture current regime; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime and recent variability. These choices reduce excess ordering against a likely-unreliable pipeline and align service level to recent demand while keeping the backend\u2019s lead-time assumption unchanged.

Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 but no arrivals observed from Period 10\u201335 concludes, indicating many shipments likely lost or severely delayed; earlier confirms show lead_time=2 for some arrivals but the recent sustained absence implies effective lead-time risk. To force the OR engine to hold more pipeline safety while acknowledging lost shipments risk, set lead time explicitly longer than promised (explicit L=4). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with the chosen L=4, balancing higher service level against holding cost given profit/holding ($4/$1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=376. History shows many missing/delayed arrivals since Period 10 (likely lost or very long delays) though several concluded arrivals indicate typical lead times around 2 (observed W = 2,2,1,2 \u2192 avg ~1.75). To remain data-driven about lead time while letting the OR engine use its full demand history for forecast and variability, set L by observed average ('calculate'). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (captures historical demand) without overstating volatility given uncertain in-transit status.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical concludes show persistent missing/delayed arrivals since Period 10 with large in-transit = 376; confirmed lead_time observations earlier cluster at 2 periods but many shipments appear lost. Recent observed demand (Periods ~18\u201337) is materially lower and stable versus the high-demand regime in early periods. To avoid overstating demand, I use a recent-sample demand estimate (last 20 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent regime. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded arrivals still include multiple 2-period observations and the OR backend expects the promised lead time; using default avoids overcorrecting for lost shipments which the backend cannot model. These choices bias ordering toward the recent lower-demand regime while relying on the backend's promised-L behavior to compute safety stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=376 with a long history of missing/delayed shipments since Period 10 (no arrivals P10\u2013P30) suggesting many in-transit units are unreliable. Recent observed demand (many weeks of low true demand signals since summer) is lower than early-year peak. To avoid expecting imminent arrivals and to make the OR engine hold less safety stock while capturing recent lower demand, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised to reflect shipment unreliability, and use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (low-demand summer\u2192fall). This reduces overstating required pipeline and balances service vs holding cost given high holding cost relative to profit (holding=$1, profit=$4).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=43, in-transit=318 (large outstanding pipeline; many past orders never concluded \u2192 likely lost or severely delayed shipments). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 36: demands = [13,13,16,15], mean=14.25 over last 4 periods. A concluded arrival shows lead_time=3 (order P36\u2192arrived P39), so use an explicit longer lead time to hedge for delayed arrivals. Set L explicit=3 to reflect recent observed 3-period delay. For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new low-demand regime; sigma also recent_N N=4 to reflect recent low volatility. These choices reduce order quantities compared with long-run averages, avoid inflating inventory given many in-transit units likely lost, and align safety stock calculation with a shorter, low-demand regime while accounting for increased lead time risk.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=32, in-transit=318; history shows many long delays and at least one confirmed 3-period lead time (P36\u2192P39) plus widespread lost/delayed shipments since P10. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the recent confirmed 3-period arrival and persistent delays (safer than promised=2). Demand has fallen recently (Periods 36\u201340 demands = 13,13,16,15,11); to capture the current low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 5 observed demands. These choices raise protection for extended lead time while basing forecast and volatility on the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and large suspicious in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time observed as 3 periods (ordered P36 arrived P39: lead_time=3).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Current on-hand=28, in-transit=318; recent confirmed arrivals show lead_time=3 (P36\u2192P39) and many earlier shipments missing, so use explicit L=3 to reflect observed slower arrivals. Recent demand (Periods 36\u201341) is the most relevant low-demand regime (requests: 13,13,16,15,11,4); use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing overstating demand from early-year samples. This choice balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) while keeping forecasted demand and safety stock aligned with the recent low-demand regime to limit holding cost given large in-transit inventory and suspected lost shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=19, in-transit=318 but many prior orders after Period 9 did not conclude -> sustained missing/delayed shipments; most recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=3 (ordered P36\u2192arrived P39). To be conservative given observed delays I set lead time explicitly to 3. Demand in recent weeks (Periods 36\u201342: 13,13,16,15,11,4,9) best represents the current regime, so I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest mean and volatility over the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (using recent demand) vs holding cost while acknowledging likely lost/delayed earlier in-transit stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=10, in-transit=318. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2,3} (avg=2.0) with intermittent long delays and some lost shipments earlier; large outstanding in-transit suggests many units may be delayed/lost but concluded lead-time evidence averages to 2. To be conservative but data-driven, set L via 'calculate' (avg observed lead time). Demand training samples are the provided 5 weekly samples (mean=86.8); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting OR engine produce capped base-stock orders while accounting for observed lead-time average. This balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent observed demand has been low (periods 36\u201344 demand series: 13,13,16,15,11,4,9,9,8) while historical early-2019 baseline was higher (51,64,75,99,145). On-hand=2, in-transit=318 but many past in-transit shipments were delayed or lost; concluded arrivals show variable lead times including 2 and 3 and long gaps. I set L explicit=3 because recent confirmed arrival (P36\u2192P39) and prior prolonged delays indicate effective lead time has stretched to 3 for planning (explicit helps cover arrival delays/loss signals). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime evident since Period 36 (use the last 9 observed demands). These choices reduce target stocking (lower mu_hat) to avoid excess holding on a large, unreliable pipeline while using longer L to avoid under-ordering for delayed arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-23 (Period 46). Demand has been low and stable in recent weeks (periods 39\u201345: demand samples = 15,11,4,9,9,8,11) while arrivals have been highly unreliable (multiple late/lost shipments; observed lead times = 1,2,3 in history and long gaps). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (likely includes lost/delayed units). To be conservative vs. supply uncertainty I set lead time explicit=3 (matches observed P36\u2192P39 and recent 3-period delay signals). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (using the last 7 observed demands) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets an (1+L)-period forecast anchored to recent reality. This balances service level (longer L to reflect delays) against holding cost (recent low demand reduces target base stock).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has settled at a low winter level (Periods 39-46 demands = 15,11,4,9,9,8,11,3; recent mean ~8.75). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 but many past in-transit shipments were not concluding (sustained missing arrivals historically), and lead time observations show variability with a confirmed 3-period event (P36\u2192P39). To be conservative about service and to let the OR backend size orders for the current slower seasonal demand while accounting for observed longer lead times and lost shipments, I set L explicitly to 3 (best current estimate), use a recent_N demand estimate (N=8) to capture the low recent regime for mu_hat, and match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) to reflect current volatility. This balances lower target stock (avoid excess holding cost) with a longer lead time to protect against stockouts given past delayed/lost arrivals.
