Why I deviate: With zero on-hand and zero pipeline, we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand that will occur after our decision. The expected 3-period demand is \u2248305 units; ordering only OR's capped 147 would leave a large shortfall and certain stockouts (losing high profit $4/unit). Given profit $4 vs holding $1, the critical fractile (0.8) implies favoring availability; hence I prioritize covering expected demand rather than adhering to OR's cap that limits replenishment when pipeline is low. Decision: order enough to meet expected 3-period demand. I choose to order 306 units (rounding 305.4 up by 1) to cover the mean 3-period forecast. Risk notes: This ignores safety stock beyond the mean; if demand realizes much higher than mean there is stockout risk, and if arrivals are lost later (we'll detect from conclude messages) we'll adjust. No concluded lead-time evidence exists yet, so I used promised L=2 in the forecasts.",

The 306 units ordered in Period 1 are still in-transit and expected to arrive during Period 3 arrival resolution (visible in Period 3 conclude read in Period 4).

Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=306 \u2248 required pipeline to cover next 3 periods.

Concluded messages through Period3 show no arrivals for any orders, including the large Period1 order that, under promised L=2, should have appeared in the Period3 conclude if lead time were 2. This indicates a delayed or possibly lost shipment, but we have only a single large order missing its promised arrival (insufficient to confirm a new persistent lead-time distribution per Carry-Over rules). Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u20133) averaged ~39 units/week (45,46,25), well below the historical sample mean OR uses, and OR's capped base-stock policy recommends 0 given pipeline=306. Ordering now risks creating excess holding cost if the in-transit arrives; not ordering risks stockouts if the in-transit is lost. Given uncertainty and the OR baseline already caps order at 0, the conservative choice is to follow OR and place 0 units this period while monitoring for a concluding arrival in upcoming periods.

Profit per unit ($4) versus holding ($1) yields a high critical fractile (0.8) so it's acceptable to hold some safety stock rather than risk stockouts.

  "rationale": "Observations and lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) but no new sustained lead-time change since prior carry-over insights; therefore treat promised L=2 as uncertain but usable. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=76 and in-transit=401 \u2192 total pipeline = 477 units. Recent realized demand in the high-demand regime (Periods 43\u201345) averaged \u2248114 units/week, so (L+1)=3 periods of demand \u2248342 units. Decision vs OR: OR recommends 0 (uses historical low-demand data and promised L). Given current high-demand regime and substantial pipeline (477 > required \u2248342), additional ordering risks holding cost without improving service. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost while letting in-transit stock cover the upcoming high-demand weeks; monitor arrivals in conclude messages to detect any lost/delayed shipments and adjust next period if pipeline shortfalls appear.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed lead times vary (1\u20133 periods historically) and several shipments were delayed/lost earlier, but current pipeline shows In-transit=401 units. Recent demand has risen sharply (Period 42\u201346 demands: 661,118,101,124,135) so use a high-demand outlook. Required coverage = (L+1) periods; using promised L=2 => cover 3 periods. Using recent realized demand excluding one extreme outlier (661), a conservative single-period demand \u2248130 \u2192 3-period demand \u2248390. Pipeline (401) + on-hand (0) already covers ~3 periods, so no additional order is needed now. OR's capped recommendation of 27 would increase holding cost without materially reducing stockout risk given current pipeline and uncertain/short observed lead times. Therefore place 0 units to avoid excess holding cost while monitoring arrivals and lead-time confirms in upcoming concludes.",
