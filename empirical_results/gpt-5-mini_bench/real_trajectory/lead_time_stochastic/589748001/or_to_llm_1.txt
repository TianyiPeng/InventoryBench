  "rationale": "Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=588. Historical/concluded evidence shows variable actual lead times and some lost/delayed shipments (P1 lost; P27 arrived with L=3), but there is currently a large pipeline quantity (588) that should cover upcoming demand even if some delays occur. Economics: profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1/period, so the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 safety factor ~0; marginal profit from selling an extra unit equals marginal holding cost, making forward ordering unattractive absent clear shortage risk. OR recommended 0 units (uses promised L and historical demand); I agree given the large pipeline, high holding costs, and no conclusive evidence that the 588 in-transit is lost. Action: place 0 orders to avoid incurring holding cost on potentially redundant inventory while waiting for pipeline to conclude and provide clearer lead-time signals.",
