Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent sample history (0,0,14,47,29) shows elevated recent demand but limited data; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish. Use promised lead time (default L=2) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (covering (L+1) periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=52 (ordered Period 1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 not overdue given promised L=2 (arrival expected in Period 3). Recent demand history (samples: 0,0,14,47,29 plus Period 1 demand=16) shows variability but no sustained regime shift (no 3+ periods of consistent change). No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. Therefore keep promised lead time (default) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all samples for mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (coverage for review+lead period) without overreacting to short-term noise while accounting for current in-transit stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=100 (orders P1=52, P2=48). Promised lead time=2; concluded messages show arrived=0 for P1 and P2 but this is expected given promised L=2 (arrivals would conclude later). Recent demand observed in periods: P1=16, P2=23; historical sample window (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) has mean demand ~18. Use default lead time (promised L=2) because there is no concluded evidence of a different actual lead time or sustained delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a balanced base-stock that accounts for review+lead demand while the in-transit shipment is still expected to arrive. This avoids overreacting to two periods of stockouts and balances profit vs. holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=103 (multiple prior orders have not yet concluded => possible delay but not confirmed lost). Recent observed demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) = 16, 23, 12; older historical samples exist but recent weeks show nonzero steady demand. I keep L as default (promised 2) because no concluded arrivals have established a different lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent realized demand regime (captures the last three concluded demands). This biases ordering to cover near-term demand while limiting extra holding cost given a low holding rate relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $792.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 with lead_time=2, matching the promised lead time. On-hand=6, in-transit=55 (includes prior orders some of which may be delayed/lost but only one concluded lead-time observation exists). I choose L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times (evidence supports lead_time=2). Demand history mean = 18 units/week; with (1+L)=3 this implies a review+lead demand around 54, so I use default mu_hat to let backend compute (1+L)*mean of all samples. Volatility will use default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. These settings keep the OR engine aligned with the confirmed lead time and the recent demand level while letting the capped ordering rule limit order size given uncertainty and holding cost tradeoffs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4, lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=103. Historical demand shows rising recent demand (Period1-5 sold/demand = 16,23,12,42,45) and confirmed lead time evidence (Period2 order arrived in Period4 => lead_time=2). Use lead-time inference from observed concludes (calculate) to lock L=2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent upward demand regime (use the last 5 demand samples) so the base stock and caps reflect the current higher mean and volatility while avoiding stale long-run averages. This balances higher service level given large in-transit but zero on-hand against holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has stepped up: Periods 4-6 demands = 42,45,44. On-hand=4, in-transit=78 (total pipeline 82) which currently covers multiple periods. Observed lead times from concluded messages: order on P2\u2192arrived P4 (LT=2), order on P5\u2192arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2014 mixed signals. To balance responsiveness to the recent higher demand while acknowledging variable lead time, I set L as recent_N over the last 2 observed lead times (captures current 1\u20132 mix). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 4\u20136). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to serve the elevated recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has risen sharply vs. the older 2019-Jan samples: last 7 observed weekly demands = [16,23,12,42,45,44,56], showing a sustained higher regime. Lead-time observations are mixed (Period2\u2192P4 = 2; Period5\u2192P6 = 1). Use the backend's lead-time calculation from observed history rather than assuming promised. Set L by 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new higher-demand regime (covers the 7 most recent periods), so base-stock and cap reflect current demand and variability and reduce stockouts while containing holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand is high and volatile (recent period demands: 16,23,12,42,45,44,56,81) and on-hand=0, in-transit=80. Observed lead times are mixed (arrivals indicate 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine uses the empirical average. With limited samples and clear recent demand spikes but no sustained new regime, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost and lets the OR engine apply its capped ordering rule given uncertain lead time and transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Observed concluded lead times from history = {P4:2 (P2\u2192P4), P6:1 (P5\u2192P6), P8:2 (P6\u2192P8), P8:1 (P7\u2192P8)}; average = 1.5 \u2192 use calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time. Demand shows a clear sustained upward shift starting Period 4 (see reasoning below), so I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime and limit impact of older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher forecast for recent higher demand) vs holding cost by not over-reacting to a single spike (using N=6 rather than all-history).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4 (2019-03-04 to 2019-04-08): avg demand increased from 17.0 (Periods 1-3) to 51.5 (Periods 4-9), +34.5 units (+203%).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=56, in-transit=103. Historical concludes show confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 4 (sustained higher mean) and mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods). To capture true lead-time behavior use calculate (average observed lead times). To reflect the sustained higher demand since Period 4, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over that regime (Periods 4-10, 7 samples) so the (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std reflect current higher demand and variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=28, in-transit=136; recent demand regime since Period 4 shows elevated demand (~51.5 avg), so base-stock should reflect the higher regime. Promised lead time is 2 and previous carry-over confirmed lead_time=2; I keep L as default to align with supplier promise. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) to use the last 8 post-changepoint periods (Periods 4\u201311) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility from the higher-demand regime. This balances service (capture elevated demand) while in-transit stock is already high, limiting additional cap-driven orders.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=159. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5), and a sustained demand regime increase from Period 4\u20139 (avg \u224851.5) was previously identified. I set L to calculate so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures the 1\u20132 period variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (regime length = 6 periods, Periods 4\u20139) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the current higher-demand regime while letting the backend account for the mixed 1\u20132 period lead-time behavior, balancing service level (high profit, q\u22480.95) against holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (sizable pipeline). Concluded-history shows observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2] (avg\u22481.57) so I let backend compute an empirical average lead time (method=calculate). Demand rose at Period 4 and that higher regime has persisted; to capture recent elevated demand I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 demand periods (regime length ~10 periods). These choices let the OR engine set a base-stock reflecting the sustained higher demand while L=calculate adapts to the mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals observed; the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering risk.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2}, avg\u22481.625) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 with higher mean. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 4\u201314, length=11) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the newer, higher demand and recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while acknowledging variable lead times and existing in-transit stock to avoid overstocking vs. stockouts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=177. Historical demand rose at Period 4 and has remained elevated (Periods 4\u201315). Multiple concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period realizations but overall average near 1.6. To reflect sustained higher demand I set demand estimates using recent data since the confirmed regime change (Periods 4+). I let the backend compute an averaged observed lead time (calculate) to balance occasional 1-period arrivals vs. promised 2. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=12) focuses the forecast and volatility on the post-change regime (Periods 4\u201315), helping the OR engine size base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding costs moderated by accurate recent variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W = 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg 1.625), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average). Demand shifted up at Period 4 (recorded carry-over); therefore I use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201316, regime length = 13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility. These choices make the OR engine target a base-stock tuned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the calculated L captures the observed faster-than-promised arrivals on average, helping balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (capture last 14 periods since the regime start). These choices balance higher service level (capture elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=173 \u2014 healthy pipeline but arrivals have varied historically (observed lead times 1\u20132). Demand has been higher recently: last 6 period demands (P13\u2013P18) = [42,47,52,44,27,43], avg=42.5. I use promised lead time (default) since carry-over already confirmed LT\u22482 and no new sustained LT shift. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the elevated recent regime; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean so backend will scale to cover review+lead. For volatility I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward higher service (matching recent higher demand) while relying on large in-transit to avoid over-ordering given holding cost = $1/unit.

Demand shows a prior sustained upshift starting Period 4, but more recent weeks are lower/variable; use an adaptive demand estimate (EWMA) to weight recent demand while retaining some memory. L set to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times; mu_hat uses EWMA_gamma to adapt to recent demand patterns; sigma_hat left as default (uses all samples) to avoid underestimating variability given mixed regimes and occasional spikes. These choices balance service (accounting for variable lead time and recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=156. Historical concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2), and demand regime rose around Period 4 and has been elevated since. Several recent periods (P15\u2013P20) show sustained demand: [52,44,27,43,30,22] so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering P15\u2013P20) so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand under the current higher-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods; use observed-average lead time. Use recent_N=6 for demand mean/volatility to capture the post-shift regime and avoid diluting with very old low-demand samples. This balances service (cover upcoming (1+L) periods) while acknowledging substantial pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=156. Historical concluded lead times show mix but promised lead time=2 was previously confirmed (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 17-22 = 27,43,30,22,25,33; mean=30) is the best signal for the next (L+1)=3-period demand; using recent_N=6 captures the post-shift regime without overreacting to single spikes. Keeping L=default (promised=2) because concluded history supports promised lead time and some shipments have variable 1-2 delays but no sustained increase. Choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent realized demand and volatility while leveraging large in-transit quantity (156) to avoid unnecessary orders.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=156. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1] (avg 1.6) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 4 (higher mean). To respect confirmed variability in lead times while using backend's promised-L assumption, I choose L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (captures ~1.6). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (regime from Period 4 through now, N capped at 20) so mu_hat reflects the higher post-changepoint mean across the (1+L) review+lead window. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than dilute with older low-demand samples. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given higher recent demand and variable lead times) while acknowledging holding cost ($1) by using only recent elevated demand to set base stock rather than all historical data.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=161. Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms nominal lead time = 2 periods (carry-over). Recent history shows variable demand but no new sustained regime change since prior insight. Given large in-transit pipeline and confirmed lead time, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overreacting to recent variability and prevents excess ordering while pipeline arrives.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=161. Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods with confirmed 2-period events earlier; no new sustained lead-time regime or demand shift in the last 3+ periods. To avoid overfitting to noisy/partially missing arrivals and to let the OR engine use its promised-L model and full-sample demand stats, I select default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility (use all samples). This keeps ordering stable given a large in-transit pipeline and prevents chasing potentially lost/delayed shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=161 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple review+lead periods. Historical confirmed demand regime shift (Period 4\u20139 higher mean) and confirmed lead time previously, but recent realized demands (Periods 22\u201326 = 33,42,24,41,61) show a moderate high-but-variable level. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded arrivals support the promised cadence and no new sustained lead-time change is confirmed. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent regime (last 5 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These settings keep the OR backend responsive to recent demand while the large in-transit balance reduces the need for extra conservatism.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=161. Recent demand has surged (Periods 25-27 = 41, 61, 118). Orders in-transit have not arrived for 3+ periods past promised LT=2, so I increase assumed lead time to guard against relying on late/lost arrivals. Set L explicitly=4 to cover prolonged/uncertain transit. Forecast demand using the most recent 3 weeks (Periods 25-27) to capture the current surge: mu_hat recent_N N=3. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service during extended lead times while using recent data to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: 161 units in-transit with no arrivals for Periods 25-27 (3 periods past promised LT=2) \u2014 possible lost or extended lead time.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=301. Recent history shows several orders failing to arrive on schedule (Periods 25-27 had no arrivals despite promised LT=2) and highly variable, elevated recent demand (Periods 24-28 demands = 24,41,61,118,39). To protect service while acknowledging delayed shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (extend promised LT=2 to reflect observed delays). Forecast demand over the review+lead period uses recent_N=5 to capture the new higher regime and recent volatility. Sigma uses recent_N=5 to reflect increased variability. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the elevated short-term demand and compensate for likely extended transit, while the capped-order logic will limit excessive ordering to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: 301 units in-transit with no arrivals for Periods 25-27 (3 periods past promised LT=2) \u2014 probable extended lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=348 with several recent periods of arrivals missing; however no new 'conclude' arrival messages confirm a lead-time change, so retain promised lead time. Recent demand has trended higher (last 6 periods demands: 24,41,61,118,39,61) so I use a recent-N forecast to capture the elevated regime and short-term volatility. L uses default (promised=2) to avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to upweight the recent higher mean and variance, improving service while controlling holding cost given large pipeline.

No sustained new demand regime since prior notes. Using calculate for L to reflect observed lead times, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps safety stock appropriate given profit=$19 vs holding=$1 and confirmed LT=2.

Historical concluded lead times are mostly 1\u20132 with multiple confirmations of LT=2; recent arrivals (Period 30) resolved earlier missing shipments. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime shift in the concluded history. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and broad historical demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (using full-sample mean) vs holding cost given modest holding cost relative to profit.

Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods with multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals; use calculate to capture average observed LT. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 26 (demands: 61,118,39,61,67,80,60 \u2014 7 periods); use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the recent elevated demand regime. These choices balance service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost by using a recent-window forecast rather than global mean.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 27 (multiple weeks of very large demand: P27=118, P30=67, P31=80, P32=60, P33=135) and substantial in-transit stock (279). Promised LT=2 has been repeatedly confirmed in concluded messages earlier; no new conclusive evidence of a permanent LT increase. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent demand periods (N=7 covers Periods 27\u201333) so the backend's (1+L) scaling uses the elevated mean and variability. I leave L as default (promised lead time) because concluded arrivals still support LT\u22482; this avoids overcompensating for earlier isolated missing shipments while the large in-transit position already provides coverage. This balances service level (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

There have been prior missing/ delayed shipments in carry-over history; using calculate for L lets backend infer the empiric average lead time from observed concludes. For demand parameters, use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility so the OR engine applies the standard base-stock and cap formulas while accounting for the inferred lead time; this balances service level (by raising safety stock when observed lead time exceeds 1) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times but several confirmed 2-period arrivals (e.g., P30 arrival from P28). Pipeline is large (338) suggesting prior orders active; some earlier missing-shipment concerns exist but recent arrivals validate promised LT mostly. Demand since P30 is elevated (weeks: 67,80,60,135,70,57). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (uses concluded history) so the engine adapts to the 1\u20132 variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the new, higher recent demand regime (periods 30\u201335). I match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) so variability reflects the recent spike and volatility. These choices target service (cover elevated recent demand) while allowing the OR engine to cap orders given the large in-transit inventory and holding cost sensitivity (profit $19, holding $1).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent concludes show variable lead times with a recent 3-period arrival (order P33 arrived P36). Demand has been elevated in recent weeks (Periods 32-36: 60,135,70,57,50) vs earlier history. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to let backend average the last 3 observed lead times (captures recent upward drift while smoothing a single anomalous value). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the mean of the last 5 demand samples (captures the current higher-demand regime). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to protect service during the higher recent demand and slightly longer observed lead times while keeping volatility consistent for safety sizing. On-hand=21 and in-transit=267 are large; parameters bias stocking toward servicing ongoing high demand while the backend cap will limit excess ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=301. Recent concluded lead times include 1,2,3 (most recent arrivals: lead_time 3 at P36, 2 at P30, 1 at P19). Demand has been elevated recently (periods 35-37: 57,50,33). To reflect recent shifts in both lead time and demand I use recent_N with N=3 for all parameters so the OR backend computes L as the avg of the last 3 observed lead times and mu/sigma from the last 3 demand samples (covering the review+lead period). This balances higher short-term demand and slightly extended/variable lead times while avoiding overreacting to single observations.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Observed lead times recently: {3,1,2,1,2} \u2014 variable but averaging \u22482, so set L via recent_N to capture recent transport behavior. Demand has risen and been volatile in recent weeks (recent demands: 135,70,57,50,33,83), so use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast and variability to the current high-demand regime. These choices balance higher service needs (capture recent high mean) against holding cost by using recent samples rather than all-time mean.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=316. Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times (recently 3,2,1) and a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 27 (large weekly sales Sep\u2013Nov). To balance service (high recent demand) versus holding cost, I estimate lead time from the most recent observed lead-time samples (captures drift/extended shipments) and base demand forecasts on the recent high-demand regime. Chosen: L by recent_N to reflect recent LT variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N using the recent high-demand regime to size base-stock for (1+L) periods and capture recent volatility. This increases availability during the confirmed higher-demand period while keeping caps enforced by the OR engine to limit over-ordering.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=316. Recent concluded lead times show variability (1,2 and a 3); recent average > promised 2, so use a short recent average. Demand has clearly increased and become more volatile in later periods (many high weekly demands P30\u2013P39); use recent window to capture elevated mean and variance. Chosen methods: L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lead-time shifts (weights last 5 observed lead times); mu_hat=recent_N (N=10) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=10) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 demand observations, improving service vs holding tradeoff given higher recent demand and shipment uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=18, in-transit=267. Recent realized demand (Periods 36-41) averaged ~49 units/week with high variance; pipeline is large but lead time observations have varied (1\u20133) and show no new sustained shift\u2014retain promised lead time. Choose L=default to keep backend using promised LT=2. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher-demand regime (captures Weeks 36\u201341 mean/volatility) so the base-stock raises target service while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods. This balances profit (high per-unit margin) versus holding cost by sizing safety stock to recent observed demand and variance.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133 periods) with an average ~1.7; several past shipments were delayed but most concluded within 1\u20133 periods. Demand history includes a single extreme spike at Period 42 (315 units) likely event-driven (Black Friday) and not necessarily sustained. To balance service (high profit/higher target fill) versus holding cost, set L using observed average lead time (calculate) so the OR engine accounts for empirical LT > promised. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent demand more (captures increased recent demand without overreacting to one-off spike). Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand shows a large short-lived spike (Period 42 demand=315, Period 43 demand=144) but not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times (observed from arrive messages) average ~1.71 periods; hence use calculated average lead time to reflect variability. Use default demand and volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because no conservative, sustained demand regime change (\u22653 periods) is confirmed beyond typical seasonality. These settings let the OR engine size base-stock to cover review+lead demand using observed lead-time average while avoiding overreacting to a short spike given large in-transit stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=576; recent weeks show a large holiday demand spike (Period 42 demand=315, Period 43=144). Use observed concluded lead times to set L via calculate (average of observed lead times = ~1.75) rather than trusting promised=2 because historical LT has varied (1\u20133). To bias the demand forecast toward the recent holiday surge, use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so recent high demands receive greater weight while smoothing noise. Given high recent demand volatility, set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture current variability without overfitting one extreme week. These settings aim to raise the base-stock to serve elevated holiday demand while controlling holding cost by smoothing demand and using a recent volatility estimate.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent weeks show a strong Dec demand spike (holiday): Periods 42-45 demand = [315,144,29,196], well above prior baseline (~49). On-hand=113, in-transit=267. Promised LT=2 has been reliable recently (multiple concluded 2s around P30s and P43\u2192P45). To capture the confirmed holiday regime I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the high short-term demand; keep L=default to respect the contract and recent evidence of LT\u22482. This raises base-stock and risk buffer to prioritize service during the seasonal peak while accepting modest holding cost given high profit margin (profit=19, holding=1 => target q\u22480.95).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand spike in Dec confirmed (Periods 42-45): avg demand increased from ~48.8 (Periods 36-41) to 171.0 (Periods 42-45), +122.2 units (+250%).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Current on-hand=42, in-transit=634. Recent weeks are in the Dec seasonal spike (Periods 42-45) with very elevated demand; pipeline is large from recent replenishments. Observed lead times have varied; to reflect that uncertainty I ask the backend to calculate an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I focus on the confirmed recent seasonal regime (Periods 42-45) so use a recent_N forecast (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock responsive to the Dec spike while relying on the backend's empirical LT estimate to handle lead-time variability and possible delayed shipments.
