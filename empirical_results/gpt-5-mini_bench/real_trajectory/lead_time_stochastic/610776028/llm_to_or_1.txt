Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift (0,0,8,17,27) with the last 3 weeks averaging 17.33 units\u2014trend likely to continue near-term. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline; promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals to infer otherwise. I choose L=default (use promised 2). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent upswing across the review+lead period. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to reduce stockouts given the sustained demand uptick while keeping variance estimation tied to the same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg increased from 0.0 (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) to 17.33 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples show a sustained regime increase beginning 2019-01-21 (avg \u224817.33 over last 3 samples vs 0 earlier). The order placed in Period 1 (33 units) has not concluded (arrived=0), suggesting shipment delay or loss beyond the promised LT=2; with only one missing arrival I conservatively estimate effective lead time is longer this period. I set L to explicit=3 to account for potential delayed arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use dataset-wide defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the increased safety stock implied by longer L while letting backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples show a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (three recent weekly samples: 8,17,27). On-hand=0, in-transit=103 (orders P1=33,P2=70) but no arrivals concluded yet; this suggests delayed or lost shipments but not a confirmed lead-time change. I keep L at promised (default) because concluded arrivals do not prove a systematic lead-time increase. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). For uncertainty I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters aim to raise target stock to meet the new demand regime while avoiding overreaction to potential lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand has jumped sharply (Period1=77, P2=143, P3=176) versus earlier historical samples (0,0,8,17,27) and previous carry-over noted a regime shift around 2019-01-21. On-hand=0, in-transit=282 (pipeline present but prior orders have not concluded; no confirmed lead-time change from conclude messages). I keep L=default (promised 2) because no concluded arrivals confirm a different lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses the three most recent demand periods) so the OR engine builds a base stock reflecting the elevated demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect current demand volatility from the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given the clear demand increase) while sigma_hat informs safety stock to balance holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has jumped: Periods 1-4 demands = [77,143,176,143], clearly higher than earlier historical lows. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 \u2014 pipeline plus on-hand will cover upcoming periods but some earlier orders remain outstanding; Period 4 conclude shows an arrival for the P2 order (70 units) confirming at least some arrivals. I set L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (evidence below). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses the last 4 samples: 77,143,176,143). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4: arrived=70 units, lead_time=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 3-5) = [176,143,129], recent mean ~149.3. Carry-over shows demand regime shift in Jan and lead time confirmed=2. Using promised lead time (default) keeps OR engine aligned with supplier terms. I set mu_hat recent_N N=3 to capture the current higher demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean over last 3 periods) so the base-stock reflects recent demand surge. sigma_hat recent_N N=3 captures recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance samples. Given pipeline=465 vs expected review+lead demand ~3*149=447, we should avoid aggressive extra ordering; these parameters let backend compute a modest order while maintaining service and controlling holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history shows mixed actual lead times (observed 2 and 1), and a large in-transit pipeline (419 units) with on-hand 0. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability; keep demand forecast and volatility as default (use full-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) because the historical demand series is short but shows a sustained upward regime already captured in carry-over. This balances service (use average observed L) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. On-hand=0, in-transit=419 (sizable pipeline). Observed arrivals show mixed lead times: recent observed lead times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6)] => use recent_N to capture short-term average. Demand has clearly shifted up vs early Jan; use recent_N demand estimate based on last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) to reflect current regime. Using L=recent_N(N=2) yields (1+L) applied to recent mean demand for mu_hat; sigma_hat uses recent_N(N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (higher recent demand) while recognizing a large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has been high (Period4-8 demands = 143,129,138,200,194) after an earlier regime shift (noted). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 for order P2), 1 (P6 for order P5), 2 (P8 for order P6) \u2192 recent pattern ~1.67. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=497 (large pipeline but arrivals have been irregular). To capture the recent high-demand regime and recent lead-time behavior I set L to the average of the last 3 observed lead times (recent_N N=3) and compute demand mean and volatility from the last 5 periods (recent high-demand window) so the OR backend targets higher service while limiting overstock. This balances high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by using recent demand estimates (increasing \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302) so the backend's z* (high service level) is applied to a realistic, recent demand distribution. No explicit correction for lost shipments is made here; large in-transit is noted and will be reconciled as conclues arrive.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has clearly shifted up (periods 5-9 demands = 129,138,200,194,184). Promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2 from earlier evidence; LT has varied but 2 is still best default. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 5 periods). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility based on the most recent stable regime, balancing service (covering upcoming weeks) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=2, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time behavior around 2 periods; pipeline (424) is large relative to recent demand but arrivals are observed with 1\u20132 period lags and occasional missing arrivals earlier. Recent periods (Periods 3\u201310) exhibit a sustained higher-demand regime (~130\u2013200/week) versus earlier low demand; therefore use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the current regime. Set L to default (promised 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility so the backend's base-stock balances service level against holding cost given the large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=527. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,1} -> avg ~1.6, so use calculate to let backend set L based on observed history. Demand has clearly shifted higher since 2019-01-21; use recent_N for demand estimates to focus on the post-shift regime. I select N=9 (Periods 3\u201311) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping N\u22653. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat biases replenishment toward current higher mean/volatility, helping the OR engine size orders to meet service levels while controlling holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; recent avg ~1.6 so use recent_N for L to reflect variability. Demand has been high and volatile since the Jan regime shift; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent high-demand periods (avoids diluting with the very low early samples). This increases base_stock to reduce stockouts given in-transit=527 and uncertain lead times while keeping holding cost in mind.

Demand history shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent sample mean \u224817.33 over 3 periods); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecasts on the higher recent demand regime (captures mean and volatility of the most relevant periods). This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given multi-period in-transit, while keeping sigma based on recent volatility to limit excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 Period 15. On-hand=22, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = [2,1,2,2,1,2], avg \u22481.67) while promised lead time is 2. Demand history shows an early regime shift (noted in carry-overs) but recent weekly demand has moderated (last 4 demands: 72,46,35,22 ending-on-hand). To balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) and avoid overstock given large pipeline, use the empirically estimated lead time (average of observed lead times) so the OR backend reduces expected pipeline coverage slightly. Use default demand statistics (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend's base-stock reflects long-run demand while capping orders via its cap rule; this is conservative given substantial in-transit inventory and recent lower realized demand.

Observed lead times from concluded arrivals = [2,1,2,2,1,2] (avg \u22481.67) so I use recent_N for L to reflect variable but ~1.7 periods. Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 137,72,46,35,49) is lower than earlier spikes; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L) demand over review+lead based on latest regime. These settings reduce ordering given heavy in-transit stock while using recent demand to avoid overstock and balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. Recent demand has settled above early-Jan levels (recent weekly demands: 137,72,46,35,49,62) after the Jan regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=424 (ample coverage vs recent demand). Observed lead times from conclude messages = {2,1,2,2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.67; use average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. Set L via calculate to capture observed average. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable demand regime (last 6 periods), which keeps orders aligned with current demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples. This keeps base stock sized for service given profit/holding tradeoff while relying on large in-transit inventory to prevent stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=424 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible recent concludes after Period 13; promised lead time=2 but observed lead times vary (mostly 2). Demand recent history (Periods 11-17): [137,72,46,35,49,62,237] with a late spike (237) that is not yet a sustained regime. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures measured variability around the promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to weight the backend forecast toward the most recent seven weeks including the recent volatility/spike; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to balance service (capture recent high-demand variability) against holding cost given a large in-transit position and mixed lead-time evidence.

Recent demand has risen sharply in the last several periods (periods 13-18 include renewed activity and large demands in P17-18); to capture the recent regime I use a recent_N demand estimate with N=6 to overweight the latest pattern while keeping some smoothing. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices balance higher service needs from recent spikes against holding cost, while letting the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using the updated L, mu and sigma estimates.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times but sufficient samples to estimate actual lead time; demand has clearly shifted up in the last 3 periods (Periods 17-19: 237, 282, 197). I set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times ~1.67) so backend accounts for observed variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 17-19 mean \u2248238.7) and reduce stockouts; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (prevent lost sales during the spike) against holding cost while acknowledging substantial in-transit inventory (517) that will be consumed against upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 (2019-06-03): avg increased from ~48.0 (Periods 13-16 demand=46,35,49,62) to 238.7 (Periods 17-19 demand=237,282,197), sustained for 3 periods.

On-hand=0, in-transit=778 which is ample pipeline cover for multiple periods. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2), so use calculated average lead time to let backend smooth that variability. For demand I use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 17-20). Sigma uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate stockout risk.

Recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 (demands: 237,282,197,161,116); use recent data to capture elevated demand. Observed lead-times have varied (1\u20132), so set L to calculate (average of observed lead times) so backend infers mean LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N with N=5 (uses Periods 17\u201321) to reflect the new high-demand regime and recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 20 order arrived in Period 22). Demand exhibited a sustained upward regime starting Period 17 (periods 17-19 demands = 237,282,197; mean \u2248238.7). On-hand=150 and in-transit=517 provide substantial pipeline cover, but to match the new high-demand regime I set L to default (promised lead time = 2) and forecast demand using the most recent high-demand regime. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed high mean (use (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples) and sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters direct the OR backend to target a base-stock appropriate for the new regime while the default L respects the confirmed lead time and avoids over-adjusting for occasional shorter arrivals.

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has settled near ~110 units/week (Periods 21-23: 116,111,104) after a mid-June spike. Inventory: on-hand=46, in-transit=517 (large pipeline arriving per prior orders). Promised lead time=2; historical concluded arrivals are consistent with that and no new sustained lead-time shift is observed. To avoid overstock given heavy pipeline, use L=default (promised 2). Forecast demand using the most recent stable regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=3 (captures current ~110/wk level across review+lead). Volatility also set to recent_N N=3 to reflect current short-term variability. These choices keep base-stock aligned to current observed demand while relying on large in-transit stock to meet near-term needs, thus reducing excess holding cost risk.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Historical concluded arrivals overwhelmingly show a 2-period lead time (multiple orders: P2->P4, P8->P10, P11->P13, P20->P22); occasional 1-period observed earlier appears isolated. Demand regime shifted up in early June then moderated in July; recent demands (Periods 19-24 = 197,161,116,111,104,104) average ~132. I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded history supports LT=2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-spike moderated demand level while smoothing earlier spike. This aims to size the (1+L)-period forecast around recent realized demand (reducing overstock risk from the June spike) while letting the OR backend compute safety stock via profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand shows the sustained higher regime that began at Period 17 (large spikes P17-P19) followed by several elevated weeks (P20-P25). On-hand=0, in-transit=517 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover upcoming demand but many past orders arrived with 2-period lead times; observed lead times include some 1-period arrivals. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures mix of 1\u20132 periods). I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the demand forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201325), balancing service level against holding cost given the large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1-periods; use aggregated observed lead times to let backend infer current average (method=calculate). Demand peaked around Periods 17-19 but has since moderated to ~100s over the most recent 8 periods (Periods 19-26); use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower post-peak regime and recent variability. These settings keep L data-driven while sizing (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the recent regime so the OR engine balances service level against holding cost given the substantial in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1-periods; recent observed lead times (last 5 concluded arrivals) average ~1.8, so I use recent_N for L to bias toward observed shorter-than-promised variability. Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 17 (multiple periods ~200+); I use recent_N (last 11 periods, P17\u2013P27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while recent_N for L helps the OR engine account for faster-than-promised arrivals seen recently, reducing overstock risk given large in-transit quantity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 (some 1) and previous carry-over already confirmed LT=2; no new sustained LT signal, so use promised lead time. Recent demand since the large June spike has moderated (Periods 22-28 demands = 111,104,104,76,92,105). I detect no new sustained regime shift beyond this recent window, so I base demand forecast and volatility on the last 6 periods to reflect the current lower post-spike demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR engine target service while avoiding excess holding given large pipeline; default L keeps backend assumption aligned with promise and observed history.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has moderated since the large June spike; last 8 observed weekly demands (Periods 22-29) = 111,104,104,46,76,76,92,105,74 (note: some earlier highs present). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=566 (pipeline large). Observed lead times historically are mostly 2 with occasional 1 \u2014 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts and volatility on the most recent regime and avoid June spike bias; this aligns ordering with current demand while accounting for pipeline. This reduces overstock risk given high in-transit inventory and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concluded lead times observed = [2,1,2,2,1,2,2] (avg ~1.71) so I use an inferred average lead time rather than promised to let OR account for observed variability. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples given the chosen L, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) with holding cost. This approach uses observed lead-time evidence while letting the OR engine apply its statistical base-stock formula to demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=566 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers near-term demand. Historical demand shows a mid-June spike (Periods 17-20) then a lower, stabilized regime from ~Period 21 onward (~71\u2013116 weekly). Promised lead time remains 2 and prior concludes confirm LT=2. To reflect the current (post-spike) demand level I use recent demand for the review+lead period: set L=default (promised 2) and base mu/sigma on the last 11 periods (Periods 21\u201331) to capture the stabilized demand (~71\u2013116) rather than the June spike. This keeps the OR base-stock aligned to current demand and avoids overstocking given already-large in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead times are mostly 2 with occasional 1s (mixed arrivals), so I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate) rather than blindly using promised. Recent demand (roughly Periods 25-32) shows a lower, variable regime versus the large June spike; I use recent_N=8 to focus mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most relevant recent behavior. This keeps orders responsive to the current lower/volatile demand while the large in-transit stock (566) reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Demand has clearly shifted since June and recently settled into a lower post-peak regime (Periods 21\u201333 mean ~86 units/week); to capture recent demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 21\u201333) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects the current regime and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent demand (Periods 25-34) averages lower (~74 units/week) after the mid-year spike. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded history supports it. I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 9 weeks (Periods 25-33/34) reflecting the post-spike lower-demand regime; this helps the OR engine target service levels without overstocking from older high-demand samples.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Promised lead time=2. Recent demand (Periods 26-36) shows a lower post-summer regime (values: 76,92,105,74,71,73,38,81,44,43,40) \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to reflect the current lower mean and volatility. No recent evidence to change confirmed lead time=2. Parameters chosen: L=default to respect promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 26-36) to capture current regime and avoid inflating orders based on older high-summer spikes. This reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-10-28. On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concluded lead times: {2,1,2,2,1,2,2} -> average ~1.71, so use calculated average lead time rather than promised to reflect observed variability. Recent demand (Periods 22-37, 16 samples) averages \u224874.25/week; demand since Period 22 is a sustained lower regime vs the June spike. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the current lower-demand regime over the review+lead horizon; L set to calculate so backend will use observed lead-time mean. This balances service (use recent higher resolution forecast) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg demand decreased from ~238 (Periods 17-19) to ~74.3 (Periods 22-37, 16 samples), sustained for 16 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand returned to the lower regime that began at Period 22 (16\u201317 sustained samples; recent mean \u224872.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=566 (large pipeline). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; keep promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for occasional 1-period arrivals. Set L=default to use promised 2. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (the length of the recent low-demand regime) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, which balances service vs. holding cost given large pipeline and lower demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical data shows the sustained demand regime drop beginning at Period 22 (many samples, lower mean ~74). Lead time has been noisy but promised=2 and previously confirmed; no new persistent lead-time change. To reduce overstock from older high-demand regime and target recent demand levels, use recent_N on the recent low-demand regime (most recent 16 concluded demand samples, Periods 22\u201337+). This lets the OR backend compute a base stock aligned to the current lower-demand regime while keeping promised lead time. No evidence of newly lost shipments requiring explicit L change.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concludes confirm stable actual lead time=2 in prior evidence and a long lower-demand regime since Period 22. I set L to default (promised lead time=2). For demand I use recent_N over the current low-demand regime (samples Period 22\u201340) to reflect the sustained lower demand; N chosen = 19 (regime length). I use the same recent_N window for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target inventory aligned with the long-lasting lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking given holding cost >0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 (earlier confirmations) so use promised/default L to align with supplier promise. Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 22 (sustained ~30\u201380/week). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using N=20 (captures the full recent low-demand regime and smooths week-to-week noise). These choices keep the OR base-stock tuned to the lower recent demand while relying on promised lead time; large in-transit volume (566) will already cover several weeks so this avoids overordering and reduces holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods (confirmed earlier); no new sustained lead-time change. Recent demand since Period 22 has been lower/stable vs mid-year spike; no new sustained demand regime change in last 3+ periods. Given large in-transit pipeline and no new signals, use promised lead time and default demand/statistics so backend uses full sample mean/volatility while respecting pipeline cap. This avoids over-reacting to noise and leverages existing in-transit stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Observed lead times (from concluded messages): 2,1,2,2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.71; orders historically arrive ~1\u20132 periods but mostly 2. Recent demand (Periods 38\u201343): [44,43,30,34,61,31] mean=40.5, noticeably below earlier regime mean \u224874.3 (Periods 22\u201337). Volatility in the last 6 periods is lower than earlier regime. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 to focus forecasts and variability on the most recent, lower-demand regime. This balances service (use recent, lower mean) against holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline (566) will provide coverage for incoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: avg decreased from ~74.3 (Periods 22-37) to 40.5 (Periods 38-43), sustained for 6 periods (2019-10-28 to 2019-12-02).

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times (observed = 2,1,2,1,2,2) average ~1.67 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Demand has a sustained lower regime since Period 38 (avg ~40.5 over 6 periods); use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking. These settings let the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with observed shorter-than-promised variability while keeping holding cost sensitivity (profit/holding -> high service target).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand has been in the lower regime established around Period 38 (avg ~40.5 over P38-43) and continued through P44-45 (27,25). On-hand=0, in-transit=566. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; no new evidence to change that. I set L to default (use promised lead time=2). For demand I detect the most recent low-demand regime from P38 onward (regime length 8 periods through P45) and use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 8 samples, which balances lower observed demand against service-level target given profit/holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand has settled into the low post-Period-38 regime (periods 38-46 demand: 44,43,30,34,61,31,27,25,33; recent mean \u224836.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=566 (sufficient pipeline). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 in multiple periods. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (2) since confirmed by history. For demand I use a recent_N forecast over the last 9 periods of the current low regime to capture the reduced mean; mu_hat recent_N N=9. To capture recent variability I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 so the backend estimates volatility from the same window. These choices keep orders aligned with the new lower demand regime while relying on the confirmed lead time and the large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.
