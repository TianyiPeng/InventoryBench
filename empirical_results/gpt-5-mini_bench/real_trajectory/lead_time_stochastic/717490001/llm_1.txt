Demand regime: recent 3-week average = 61.7 units/week; last 2 weeks average = 57.5. Lead time & pipeline: Promised lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and there are no concluded arrivals visible, so no confirmed earlier arrivals; any order placed now will arrive during Period 3 (after two-period lead time) and will not help Periods 1\u20132 demand. Forecast & order logic: Given L=2, we target (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage for the pipeline (order + on-hand + in-transit should cover 3 periods). Using a conservative forecast of ~60 units/week (rounded from recent averages) => 60*3 = 180 units. Holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), so ordering to cover three periods is appropriate despite recent decline.

Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead times have varied historically (observed lead_times = 1 and 2 in past) and some earlier shipments were delayed/lost, but current system reports In-transit=600. Inventory position: On-hand=125 + In-transit=600 = 725 total units available in pipeline. Ordering policy: promised lead_time=2 (need coverage for L+1=3 periods). Using a conservative demand forecast ~95/wk => 3-period demand \u2248285 units. Current total pipeline (725) comfortably covers 3 periods even if some in-transit delays occur. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) but profit per unit is high ($19); however excess inventory ties up capital and risks holding cost across multiple periods. Recommendation: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary additional inventory while the large in-transit balance clears and to gather more evidence on supplier reliability.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 45 is 2019-12-16, mid-December (approaching holiday peak), so demand can be volatile but recent weeks show a post-spike decline (P43-44 = 42,39). Demand regime: historical recent window P40-P42 showed higher demand (~145/wk) but last two weeks fell sharply; no clear new sustained regime change (need 3+ periods). Lead-time / pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=600. Recent concluded messages show variable lead times (some orders arrived with LT=1 or 2) and several earlier long-delayed/lost shipments, but there is no new conclude this period to change that view. Inventory assessment: in-transit=600 is a large pipeline relative to typical weekly demand (~100-150); this should cover multiple weeks including potential holiday uplift. Ordering decision: do not add more risk of excess holding cost given large pipeline and uncertain arrivals timing. Place no order this period to avoid extra holding cost and to observe which in-transit units actually conclude in coming periods.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas). T-shirt demand historically shows no large positive Christmas spike here; recent weeks (P43-P45) are low (42,39,50). Demand regime: recent 3-week average = 43, clearly below earlier high-demand regimes. Lead time/pipeline: concluded history shows variable lead times (1\u20132 periods) and occasional lost/delayed shipments, but current state shows In-transit=600 units and On-hand=0. Those 600 units are already in the pipeline and risk arriving (or partially arriving) soon. Given high pipeline stock, low recent demand, and holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs. high unit profit ($19), ordering more now increases expected holding cost without evidence of sustained demand surge. Risk assessment: potential partial/late arrivals and historical variability argue against adding more exposure. Action: place no new order to avoid excess ending inventory carrying cost while allowing in-transit stock to fulfill demand.",
