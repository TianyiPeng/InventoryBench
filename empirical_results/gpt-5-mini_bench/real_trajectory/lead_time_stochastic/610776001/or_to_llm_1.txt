Promised lead time=2 but we infer nothing new about lead time from recent concludes (no recent unexpected arrivals/lost shipments to change belief). Economics: profit=$1 and holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 (no safety stock incentive). OR recommends 0 units; its base-stock cap and demand estimate would also be very small given the current low demand, but OR ignores the large in-transit. Decision: place 0 units. Reason: existing pipeline (868) already covers many weeks of current low demand (868 >> expected weekly demand ~20\u201375), so ordering would create excess holding cost with no expected sales benefit.
