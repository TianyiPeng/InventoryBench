Decision logic: because one large in-transit shipment (211) is currently at-risk and has not concluded for many periods, I will not fully rely on it; but I also want to avoid large overstock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19. Required coverage: with promised LT=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 upcoming periods.
