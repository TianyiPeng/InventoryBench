Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand samples: P1=99, P2=102, P3=75 (avg \u224892). Historical carry-over insight already recorded indicating a prior shift to ~143/week from late Jan; recent three periods show sustained demand near 90\u2013140 range, so plan for ~100/week baseline with upside. Lead time & pipeline: Promised lead time=2. The 450 units ordered in Period 1 remain in-transit and have not concluded by Period 3 (they did not arrive by the expected promised arrival), which indicates actual lead time >2 or delayed shipment; however this is not yet a confirmed lead-time change (insufficient periods of evidence). Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=450. Current-period demand will occur after this decision and will not be satisfied by orders placed now (new orders would arrive after at least 2 periods).

Using conservative demand \u2248100/week => target \u2248300 units.

  "rationale": "Date = 2019-12-23 (week before/around Christmas). Recent realized demand (P43\u2013P45) = 38, 57, 58 \u2192 3-week avg \u224851 units/week. Promised lead time = 2 but historically variable (lead_time observed \u2208 {1,2,3} across history) so arrivals can be delayed; however there is currently a very large in-transit balance (1310 units) which, if it arrives, will more than cover near-term demand. On-hand = 2. Given high in-transit pipeline and uncertain but intermittent arrivals in prior periods, placing a new order risks large additional holding cost for slow-moving weeks; conversely, leaving stockout risk is low because of the large pipeline. Forecast for next (L+1)=3 periods \u2248153 units; pipeline (1310) >> forecast so no new order is placed. Action = 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost while awaiting pipeline arrivals.",

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year) \u2014 apparel demand typically soft post-holiday. Recent demand (P42\u2013P46) shows volatility with spikes (P42=144) but more recent weeks moderate: 38,57,58,38 \u2192 short-run demand \u224845/week. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1310 units (pipeline has history of unreliable/variable lead times and overdue shipments). Promised lead_time=2 but observed lead_time has varied (1\u20133) and many prior in-transit shipments were overdue/lost; treat pipeline as unreliable unless a conclude shows arrivals. Given very large in-transit relative to weekly demand, high holding cost exposure if additional units ordered, and low expected demand this holiday-off week, place no new order to avoid excess inventory and holding costs. Monitor next conclude for actual arrivals to reassess.",
