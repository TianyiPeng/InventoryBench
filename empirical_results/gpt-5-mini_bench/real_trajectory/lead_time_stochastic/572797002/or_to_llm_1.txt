======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=847. Historical demand (provided samples) gives \u03bc\u0304\u224880.8; with promised L=2, OR base-stock \u2248242. OR recommended 0 because pipeline_inventory (847) >> base_stock. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time has varied but has been observed as 1\u20133 at times; there is no sustained new evidence (\u22653 periods) of lost shipment or permanent lead-time change since the last recorded insights. Given profit=holding, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0) so stocking to expected demand (\u2248242 over L+1) is sufficient; ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost because pipeline already exceeds that level. Decision: follow OR and place 0 units this period. ",
