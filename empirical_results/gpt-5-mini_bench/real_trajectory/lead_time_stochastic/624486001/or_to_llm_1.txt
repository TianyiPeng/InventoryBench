OR computed a capped base-stock order of 112 units (uses full-history mean ~75.4, \u03c3~22.16, \u03bc\u0302=226.2, \u03c3\u0302~38.4, cap\u2248111.9).\nLead-time & coverage requirement: With L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand after ordering. OR's cap equals roughly one-period mean plus 95% safety \u2014 appropriate under stationary demand but may understock when demand is trending up.\nDemand assessment: Recent 3-week average (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) = (66+88+108)/3 = 87.33 units/week, which is ~51.9% higher than the first two-week avg (55+60)/2=57.5. This suggests a sustained upward regime starting ~2019-01-21.\nDecision logic: Because pipeline is empty and recent demand has shifted materially upward (3 consecutive higher periods), I increase OR's recommendation to better cover the higher short-term demand over the 3-period coverage window while accepting modest extra holding cost. I avoid matching the larger base-stock (\u2248259) because OR cap intended to smooth variability and because of holding cost.\nFinal action: Order 129 units (rounded).

To cover (L+1)=3 periods plus safety stock consistent with our service target, we need additional units beyond OR's cap.

Given prior carry-over insights, treat in-transit as unreliable for planning, but note many past in-transit units did eventually arrive. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 945 units, recent weekly demands have fallen (P24\u2013P26: 130, 86, 54) and no strong seasonal spike in mid-August is evident for a basic tee. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4, so overstocks are costly.

Demand outlook: recent confirmed weekly demand (Periods 39\u201345) averages \u224823 units/week (range 15\u201328), well below earlier spikes. Product is a basic tee in late December (no expected surge). Risk tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 OR's critical fractile would push some safety stock, but with large on-hand inventory the holding cost dominates. Lead-time promise =2 means we must cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand with stock at decision time; 3\xd7recent mean \u224869 units. On-hand 334 >> 69, so no order needed. Action: follow OR recommendation (0 units) to avoid unnecessary holding costs while waiting for any in-transit confirmations in future concluded messages.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=306, reported in-transit=2527 but carry-over insight/instructions treat pipeline as unreliable until shipments conclude. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 40\u201346) averages ~24/week (values: 22,18,28,16,15,28,28), so expected (L+1)=3 period demand \u2248 72. Profit/holding gives fractile q=4/(4+1)=0.8 (z\u22480.84) so safety need is modest. OR recommends 0 (uses promised pipeline), which aligns with my assessment because: 1) On-hand (306) >> required cover for 3 periods (~72), so no urgent replenishment. 2) Holding cost is non-trivial ($1/unit/period); ordering would increase holding cost without clear demand spike. 3) Actual pipeline is unreliable (historical lost/delayed shipments), so ordering now risks adding to in-transit uncertainty and future surplus if arrivals occur. Decision: place 0 order. This minimizes holding cost while safely covering expected demand and preserves caution given uncertain pipeline and no confirmed lead-time improvement.",
