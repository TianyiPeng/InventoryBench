Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (55,60,66,88,108) show a clear upward trend into early Feb. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead time. Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time, so keep L as default. Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the clear recent upward trend (use all available samples). Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because variance estimate from full sample is acceptable and dataset is small. These choices raise the base stock to reflect the increasing demand while keeping variability estimate conservative, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=112 (order placed P1 not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals beyond Period 1, so do not infer lead-time change; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift over the last 4 weeks (66,88,108,98) vs earlier weeks (55,60). To capture the recent higher mean and variability I use recent_N=6 (includes the 5 historical samples plus Period 1 demand=98). This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 samples so the OR backend builds a base stock reflecting the new, higher demand while L stays default to avoid premature lead-time revision given no concluded arrivals. This balances service level (protects against the upward demand regime) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than the full older series.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg increased from 57.5 (2019-01-07..2019-01-14) to 90.0 (2019-01-21..2019-02-11) (+57%), sustained for 4+ weeks

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands (Period1=98, Period2=162) align with previously recorded regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean ~90+). On-hand=0, in-transit=228 which likely covers multiple upcoming periods (promised L=2). No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed P1/P2 still not confirmed), so do NOT change lead-time estimate. Set L=default (use promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime (captures the last 5 weeks including the observed spike). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concludes show three consecutive orders (Periods 1-3) with zero arrivals despite promised L=2 \u2014 strong evidence of missing/delayed shipments. Demand regime shifted higher on 2019-01-21 and has been sustained; use a longer explicit lead time to avoid under-ordering against in-transit uncertainty. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect likely longer/missing deliveries. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) capturing the sustained higher regime; sigma_hat default to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This biases orders upward to cover the extra review+lead demand and account for shipment delays while the backend will cap orders per its cap rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=5, in-transit=333. Recent conclude shows Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (ordered P2 arrived P4) confirming actual lead time = 2 so far. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over insight). To respect confirmed lead time and higher recent demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm with more arrivals). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (N=5 captures the sustained uplift while remaining robust). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma based on recent variability supports a higher safety stock; this balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by increasing service level but not overstocking beyond recent demand evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=401 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods. Recent demand has been elevated (period demands: 98,162,134,111,123) so I use recent data to set demand forecast. Set L=default to keep promised 2. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders sized to recent demand while the large in-transit stock limits new ordering and helps balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained +57%). On-hand=0, in-transit=345 (large pipeline). Observed lead times show variability (P4 concluded an order with lead_time=2; P6 concluded an order with lead_time=1) but the 1-period observation is isolated and not yet a sustained changepoint. Use promised lead time (default) to match OR backend assumptions and avoid overreacting to a single short arrival. Forecast demand using the most recent samples to reflect the higher regime (recent_N for mu_hat). Keep sigma_hat default to use full-sample volatility until a clear variance shift is confirmed. This balances service-level (higher recent mean) against holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=487. Recent weeks show a clear higher-demand regime (recent demands: 111,123,182,205) versus earlier samples; lead-time observations are mixed (observed LT=2 and LT=1). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 2 and 1 observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to forecast over the review+lead period focusing on the new high-demand regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time data rather than the promised value.

Observed lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods); use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the new, higher regime (last 5 concluded demands mean ~168), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate replenishment needs.

Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=577 \u2014 large pipeline covering many weeks vs. high recent demand (weeks with demand 182\u2013221). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5), so I use calculate to let backend set L = average observed. Use default demand stats (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative given mixed lead-time evidence and large in-transit volume. This balances service (captures observed lead-time variability) against holding cost since pipeline is already large.

On-hand=38 + in-transit=333 = 371 units (covers multiple weeks), but demand regime remains elevated so forecast should use recent history. Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior periods, so use promised/default. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing short blips; this balances service level (avoid stockouts) versus holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent demands (P4..P11) average ~188/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=554 units which roughly matches ~3 periods demand (~564) but is slightly short. Lead time evidence previously confirmed at 2 periods; I'll use the promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=8 (periods 4\u201311) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine builds base-stock to cover the higher recent demand and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=638 which covers expected demand over lead+review. Historical concludes show mixed lead times but prior insight confirmed lead_time=2; no new sustained lead-time change. Demand has sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; use recent demand samples to reflect that shift. Set L to default (promised=2) so OR uses contractual lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand weeks. This raises the base-stock to improve service given high in-transit cover while keeping holding cost considered by backend.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has been well above the early-sample mean; on-hand=93, in-transit=489 (large pipeline). Past confirmed lead time=2 periods. I keep L as promised (default) to align with supplier promise and prior confirmation. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime (most recent 5 weeks: 186,206,267,229,128 \u2192 mean ~203.2) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean (OR will compute). Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability for safety stock. These choices prioritize service (high profit vs holding cost = 4:1) while using recent data to prevent stockouts despite large pipeline and observed demand shifts.

Historical arrivals show actual lead times variable but earlier periods confirmed lead time=2; demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning 2019-01-21. I use the promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract expectations, use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-change higher-demand regime, and keep sigma_hat at default to let the backend compute volatility from full history. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent history shows high, sustained demand (multiple weeks >150) and observed lead times mostly 2 periods (some 1s). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=686 (large pipeline). To avoid overreacting to noise and because promised lead time=2 is supported by concluded arrivals, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given high pipeline against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 period demands: 229,128,171,178,239; recent mean ~189/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=686 units \u2014 in-transit currently exceeds a 3-period demand forecast based on recent mean. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; I keep promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent variability. This gives the OR engine a forecast that reflects the new regime and avoids over-ordering given the large pipeline position.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=508 (substantial pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1-period arrivals; to be conservative I let backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Demand has clearly trended up since the Jan samples and recent realized weekly demand is much higher; to capture recent high demand while still smoothing noise I use an EWMA forecast for mu_hat with gamma=0.7. Volatility estimate uses the backend default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given large recent demand spikes and some lead-time variability, while relying on the OR engine caps to limit over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=508 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mainly 2 periods (carry-over confirmed). Use promised lead time (default) to keep OR engine aligned with contract; pipeline already reflects in-transit units. Demand has shifted to a higher sustained regime (later periods show weekly demand ~150-240 vs early ~55-108), so I use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the current regime and avoid dilution by low historical winter samples. Chosen N=10 balances recency and sample size given many recent weeks of elevated demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat raises the base-stock to protect service (high profit/low holding cost favors fill) while capping orders via the engine's cap prevents excessive single-period replenishment given large in-transit volume.

Use calculate for L to let backend infer avg observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent regime (last 5 demand observations) so the base-stock reflects current higher demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand weeks.

Historical concludes confirm lead time ~2 periods. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (and prior confirmation). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures last ~10 weeks of demand and avoids diluting with older low-demand weeks). This balances service (high recent mean -> larger base stock) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory; the OR backend will cap orders using its cap but will compute base_stock from the recent mean/volatility over the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Recent demand (Periods 18-22 = 151,197,196,172,154) shows a higher, stable regime vs early-sample Jan values; I use recent_N=5 to capture current mean for demand across review+lead and recent_N=5 for volatility.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand pattern (reduces overstock risk given high in-transit).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent weeks show sustained demand well above early-Jan levels (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=555 \u2014 large pipeline that should cover multiple weeks; no evidence of new lead-time shifts or lost shipments in concluded messages. Use default lead time (promised = 2) consistent with confirmed historical observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set provided; this balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost while respecting current large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=0, in-transit=508. Recent arrival lead times vary (latest concluded arrivals: 3,2,1), so I take a short recent average to reflect current variability. Demand historical samples show a sustained upward regime beginning 2019-01-21 (higher recent averages); I use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the higher regime rather than the older low samples. Set L to recent_N to reflect observed short-term lead-time mean; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N to weight recent higher demand and volatility, helping the OR backend raise base-stock to avoid stockouts while not overcommitting long-term inventory.

LLM Rationale:

To balance service vs holding cost I let the backend infer lead time from observed history (calculate) so L reflects the mixed realizations; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecasts use the full sample mean/variance ((1+L) scaling handled by backend). This keeps ordering conservative given large in-transit and avoids overreacting to isolated late arrivals.

Demand has shifted earlier (noted regime in Jan) and recent weekly demands (last 8 concluded periods with demand: 86,54,56,59,? \u2014 using last 8 samples) better reflect current level and volatility, so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8. These choices let the backend compute base-stock that balances service (capturing recent demand & lead-time variability) against holding cost given available pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=530. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W in {1,2,3}, average ~1.75) but no recent sustained shift; prior carry-over noted demand regime shift in Jan. Given mixed LT evidence, let backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (reduce risk of over/under-ordering). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the full-sample demand signal adjusted for the inferred lead time and balances high profit/holding ratio (q=0.8) into the service-level z*. This approach keeps orders responsive to observed LT variability while relying on established demand regime history; no new sustained pattern merits recording.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time centers on 2 periods and an earlier sustained demand regime shift (Period 2 note). No new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time since last insights; occasional 1\u20133 period arrivals appear but are not persistent. I therefore use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std (scaled by 1+L) while relying on the pipeline (508) to cover upcoming demand. This balances service (use pipeline) against holding cost without overreacting to sporadic late/early arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=511 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists so orders should account for lead time only. Historical concluded lead times cluster around 2 (confirmed earlier) with occasional 1\u20133 variability; no new sustained lead-time shift observed, so keep promised/default. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift in Jan 2019; more recently weekly demand has been lower (~30\u201360). I use recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect the current lower-demand regime and to keep safety stock responsive. Sigma also set using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce excess holding given large in-transit while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has settled much lower than early-year spike: last 6 observed weekly demands = [59,61,29,38,28,?] (use most recent 6 available to capture current low-demand regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=508 \u2014 large pipeline already covers multiple weeks (with promised L=2, pipeline >> (1+L)*mean), so avoid aggressive replenishment. Use default lead time (promised L=2) because historical concludes show variable but prior carry-over confirmed L=2 and no new sustained lead-time shift. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (N=6 balances responsiveness and sample size). This keeps base_stock aligned to current low demand and reduces holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so estimates reflect full history while L captures realized lead-time behavior.

Promised lead time remains 2 (previously confirmed). To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility so the backend sizes base-stock to recent demand levels; L set to default (promised) so arrivals are planned against the contract lead time.

No new sustained lead-time change since previous confirmation of L=2. To avoid over-reacting to volatile earlier seasons while matching current low-demand regime, I use promised lead time (default L=2) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 6 weeks to reflect current demand level and variance; the large in-transit stock will cause the backend to scale orders down via pipeline subtraction.

Recent demand (Aug\u2013Oct) is materially lower than the early-2019 peak; I will anchor demand forecast on the most recent regime to avoid overstocking given high in-transit. Therefore set L=default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low recent weekly demand and reduced volatility; this keeps base_stock conservative and prevents excess holding cost while maintaining service given existing in-transit units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent demand (Periods 30-37) has been low and stable (samples: 29,38,28,32,37,21,33,42; mean \u224833.5). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=508 (covers multiple periods). Historical carry-over shows earlier regime shift in Jan and lead time confirmation =2, but recent 8-week window shows a lower demand regime; to avoid overstocking given high pipeline and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit, use a short recent-window forecast. Set L=default (promised 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent_N=8 window (uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 8 samples) so ordering aligns with current low-demand regime and the large in-transit cushion, reducing risk of excess stock while preserving service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=2 in earlier periods; recent demand has moved to a much lower regime since ~Period 27 (Aug) with roughly 12 periods of lower weekly demand (typical demands ~20\u201340). To avoid overstocking given holding cost=1 and profit=4, keep promised lead time (default) and estimate demand using the recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to reflect the last 12 concluded demand observations so the OR backend will target a lower base-stock appropriate for the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce holding costs while maintaining service.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Historical concludes confirm lead time=2 previously and promised lead time is 2; use default L. Recent demand (Periods 31-39) is consistently low (38,28,32,37,21,33,42,24,24) indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier in-year spikes; use recent_N to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 9 periods to reflect current demand and reduce overstock risk. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture recent volatility. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=508 \u2014 ample pipeline relative to recent weekly demand (~22\u201342). Prior carry-over confirms lead time=2. Given large in-transit stock and stable lower recent demand, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock and variance from full history. This avoids overfitting to short-term noise while letting the capped order cap limit ordering given current heavy pipeline; it balances high service target (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) against holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Recent observed demand (Periods 31-41) is much lower (~21\u201342/week) than early-2019 samples; pipeline is large (508 units) and on-hand is 0. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; no evidence of new lead-time change. To avoid over-ordering given low recent demand and heavy in-transit stock, use a recent-N demand estimate based on the latest low-demand regime (Periods 31-41, N=11). Set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=508 \u2014 large pipeline but recent conclude messages show no arrivals for many periods suggesting delayed/lost shipments; however previously confirmed lead time=2. No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts detected. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses vendor promise and historical demand samples. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals and existing large in-transit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent observed demand has fallen to a low, stable winter level (Periods 35-43: 21,33,42,24,24,22,18,28,16). On-hand=0, in-transit=508 which already covers many weeks; avoid overordering. Keep promised lead time (default) since lead-time was previously confirmed as 2 and no new sustained evidence of change. Use recent_N for demand and volatility to capture the recent low-winter regime (short-term average/variance) so the OR backend won't size orders based on the much higher Jan\u2013Jun volumes. This reduces holding cost given large in-transit stock while maintaining service for current low demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent observed weekly demand has fallen from earlier-year peaks to low teens\u201330s in Nov\u2013Dec. On-hand=0 and in-transit=508 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded evidence confirmed LT=2. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and large pipeline, I keep L as default (promised=2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent data to focus forecasts on the most recent demand regime (reduces forecasted order quantities despite large pipeline). Using recent_N=20 captures the last ~20 weeks of lower demand and recent volatility, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical lead-time evidence previously confirmed a 2-period mode; no new sustained lead-time shift observed. Recent demand (Periods 41-45 = 18,28,16,15,28) shows a sustained lower December regime versus earlier 2019 highs, so I bias forecasts to recent weeks. I set L to promised (default=2) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent low-demand December regime (reduces overstock risk while maintaining service). These parameters let the OR backend compute a base stock tuned to recent demand and the promised lead time, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand has been low and stable since late summer (periods ~27\u201346: weekly demand mostly 15\u201337), while an earlier high-demand regime occurred in Feb\u2013Jun. On-hand=0 but in-transit=508 units (large pipeline) so we should not inflate target stock. Lead time previously confirmed as 2; use promised lead time. Use recent_N=20 for demand estimates to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (~20 recent weeks). Using recent demand mean and std over the last 20 samples keeps orders conservative (low mu_hat) and matches observed low volatility, reducing holding cost given large in-transit volume.
