Recent realized demand in Period 1 was 98 (one high week vs historical mean), which could signal a short spike but is not yet a sustained regime shift (insufficient evidence to change carry-over). Inventory adequacy: on-hand 0 + in-transit 73 is well below the 3-period expected demand (\u2248178), so replenishment now is reasonable. Action decision: follow the OR recommendation of 95 units.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time / arrivals: Use only concluded history \u2014 recent concluded arrivals confirm variable but mostly 2-period lead times for confirmed shipments; several earlier orders were delayed/lost but current system shows In-transit=460. Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=460. Recent low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201345) average \u224824 units/week; L=2 so (L+1)*mean \u224872 units needed to cover current + lead periods. OR recommended 0. Decision: follow OR and order 0 units. Reason: pipeline (460) already far exceeds required coverage (~72) and ordering would create unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) with minimal incremental profit risk; risk of some in-transit loss exists but even a substantial fraction lost leaves ample coverage. No new carry-over insight meets the 3+ period significance threshold.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR (order 0): in-transit=460 >> 3-period demand need (~72 units given recent avg \u224824/wk), so additional ordering would raise holding cost with little upside.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed 1 and 2) and intermittent lost/delayed shipments earlier, so some past orders remained in-transit for many periods. Current inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=460 (these pipeline units may include late arrivals but are currently recorded by the system). Demand outlook: recent sustained low regime since Period 30 (periods 30\u201346 average \u2248 26 units/week). With promised L=2, we must cover (L+1)=3 future periods. Estimated 3-period demand \u2248 3 \xd7 26 = 78 units. Inventory cover: in-transit 460 >> 78, so pipeline sufficiently covers expected demand even allowing for variability or partial loss. OR recommended 0 units; given large pipeline and much lower recent demand, placing additional order risks unnecessary holding cost and exacerbates lost-shipment exposure. Decision: place 0 units this period and wait for concluded arrivals to confirm which in-transit units actually materialize before ordering more.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Follow OR (order 0). In-transit=460 far exceeds 3-period demand (~78) under the current low-demand regime, so no new order until arrivals are concluded.",
