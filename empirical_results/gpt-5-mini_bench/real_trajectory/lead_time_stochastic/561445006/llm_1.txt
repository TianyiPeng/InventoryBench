Mean = 59.2 units/week; recent two weeks show a small down-tick (52, 51) but not a sustained regime shift. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 2 periods. No concluded arrivals in history to contradict promised LT; in-transit=0 and no evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With lead time possibly 2 and current period demand occurring after ordering, we need coverage for L+1 = 3 periods (current + 2 ahead). e) Final order logic: Use average weekly demand \u224859 units.
