Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show low and variable demand (115,48,41,6,64) with no clear sustained regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR engine computes base-stock and caps from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (use full-sample demand to avoid stockouts) against low holding cost ($1/unit) and modest profit ($19/unit).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=121 (order placed Period 1). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; promised lead time (2) remains best prior. Historical weekly mean demand = 54.8 (5 samples). To balance service (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1), use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend sets base-stock = (1+L)*mean + safety. This keeps policy responsive to observed demand while accounting for promised lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded messages show no arrivals for Periods 1\u20132; on-hand=0 and in-transit=249 (sum of orders 121+128). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is not confirmed\u2014could be promised 2 or delayed. I choose to retain the promised lead time (default) and use historical demand samples (all provided) to compute demand across review+lead using defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the OR backend forecast grounded in the full historical sample set while the shipment status remains unconfirmed.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 (sum of prior orders). Promised L=2 but no concluded arrivals yet; cannot confirm actual lead time from conclude messages. Historical demand samples mean ~54.8 (5 weeks) with moderate volatility. I keep L as default (promised) because there is no concluded evidence to change it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given current uncertainty and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows Period 4 arrival: 128 units ordered on Period 2 with observed lead_time=2. On-hand=1, in-transit=157 (sum of orders from Periods 1 and 3). Historical weekly demand samples mean=54.8. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence (calculate). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of all samples, capturing the full-sample average demand across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I use default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This balances service (using confirmed lead time and full-sample demand) against holding cost given a single on-hand unit and large in-transit pipeline; if in-transit shipments are lost, future periods should reassess lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Observed arrival in Period 4 confirms an actual lead time of 2 for the earlier order (ordered P2 arrived P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=291 (pipeline present but recent concludes show some orders delayed/lost). Demand recent history (Periods 1-5 demands = 99,45,11,127,117) shows elevated demand in P4-P5 but only two high periods \u2014 not yet a sustained 3+ period shift. I set L='calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (avg observed =2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent mix of low and recent high demand (weights the last 5 periods: mean \u224879.8, (1+L)=3 -> captures replenishment over review+lead). This balances service (responding to recent higher demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit units and uncertain missing shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded lead times: Period4 arrival shows LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), Period6 arrival shows LT=1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed but limited evidence. On-hand = 74, in-transit = 248 (no clear lost shipments). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 1 and 2). For demand, use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to let backend compute a stability-weighted base stock given limited but diverse historical demand. Use default sigma to apply historical volatility across the review+lead period. This balances service level vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline and mixed LT evidence.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand: Periods 1-7 show demands [99,45,11,127,117,60,46] with ending on-hand=28 and in-transit=248. Observed concluded lead times: one order had lead_time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4) and one had lead_time=1 (P5\u2192arrived P6) -> variable but limited samples. On-hand + in-transit (28+248=276) appears ample vs recent weekly demand (mean ~75). I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the 1 and 2 observations). For demand forecast and risk, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to short sample variability. No single sustained regime change meets the 3-period significance threshold, so no carry-over insight is recorded.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent on-hand=5, in-transit=192. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P6 from P5), 2 (P8 from P6) \u2014 recent variability but centered ~1.67. Demand increased starting Period 4 (127,117,60,46,114) vs earlier low samples; I treat a regime change at Period 4 and base demand forecast on the last 5 periods. To reflect the observed lead-time variability I average the last 3 observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility over the most relevant window. These choices give the OR engine an L based on recent evidence and mu/sigma that prioritize service through the elevated demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4<-P2), 1 (P6<-P5), 2 (P8<-P6) \u2192 recent average ~1.67. Demand history shows variable weekly demand (samples across Feb\u2013Apr). To let the OR backend infer appropriate lead time from observed evidence while using full-sample demand statistics, I choose L='calculate' (backend will average observed lead times) and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples. This balances using empirical lead-time evidence while avoiding overfitting to short-term demand noise given the moderate pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=143, in-transit=157 (total pipeline=300). Observed concluded lead times: {P2->P4:2, P5->P6:1, P6->P8:2, P8->P10:2, P9->P10:1} (avg\u22481.6; recent three = [1,2,2] avg\u22481.67). Recent demand (Periods 6-10) = [60,46,114,103,46] showing elevated, variable weekly demand vs earlier samples. I set L by averaging the most recent 3 observed lead times to reflect the recent mix of 1\u20132 period realizations. I set mu_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures recent regime while smoothing noise) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I set sigma_hat from the same recent 5 samples to reflect current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to recent demand and the slightly higher effective lead time, while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes; pipeline (300) currently covers ~2.67 periods of demand, so orders will be moderated by backend caps.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent realized demands (Periods 4\u201311) show a higher regime than the older samples: multiple weeks with demand >100 and sustained mid-range weeks \u2014 I therefore prefer a recent-sample demand forecast. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,1} (avg 1.6) so I let the backend compute the average from observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N=8 (Periods 4\u201311) to capture the post-February higher-demand regime; sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service given higher recent demand while keeping volatility consistent for the backend cap calculation. On-hand (96) + in-transit (171) appear adequate short-term, but the higher mu_hat helps avoid stockouts if recent demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4\u201311: recent avg demand \u224882.5 vs historical mean \u224859 (+40%); sustained for 8 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand regime (Periods 4\u201311) is higher and sustained (carry-over note). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2); use backend 'calculate' to average observed lead times rather than trusting promised 2. Use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime: choose N=8 to capture Periods 4\u201311 (the detected 8-period regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent higher average and variance, improving service while limiting excess holding given current on-hand=75 and in-transit=254.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201311 recent avg \u224882.5 vs historical \u224859; +~40%). On-hand=60, in-transit=240 provides substantial pipeline cover but past concludes show some lead-time variability and occasional 1-period arrivals. To capture the confirmed higher demand I use a recent-window demand estimate; to reflect variable actual lead times I let the backend compute the average observed lead time. Choices: L by calculate to let system average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=8) to use the 8-period sustained higher-demand regime. These settings raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N tightens variability estimate to recent behavior, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): recent demand has been above historical (sustained higher regime from Periods 4\u201311). On-hand=117, in-transit=157 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but we must size orders for elevated demand and observed lead-time behavior. Lead time: use calculated average of observed concluded lead times (recent concludes show mostly 2 with some 1s \u2192 avg \u22481.71), so choose 'calculate' to let backend use observed data. Demand mean: use recent_N with N=8 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (8-period sustained increase). Volatility: use recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding costs controlled by using recent-sample estimates.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (carry-over recorded): recent avg \u224882.5 vs historical mean \u224859 (+40%). On-hand=14 + in-transit=157 =171 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the higher demand but some in-transit orders experienced mixed lead_times; promised lead time remains reasonable. I keep L as default (promised=2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime length=8) so the OR backend sizes the base-stock to cover the elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been higher than the Jan baseline: sustained regime from Period 4\u201311 flagged earlier, and later periods (15\u201316) also show large weekly demand (103,116). On-hand=0, in-transit=281 (pipeline large but arrivals have sometimes been delayed). Observed lead times in concluded messages = [2,1,2,2,1,2,2] -> average \u22481.71, so use calculated average lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (regime length \u22488), so the backend will scale mean/volatility to the most-relevant recent samples and the calculated L will reflect observed lead-time behavior. This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than the older low baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent realized lead times in concluded messages vary (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,2,1 \u2192 avg \u22481.57), so use calculated average lead time. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 4\u201311 (recent avg \u224882.5 vs historical \u224859); to capture recent elevated demand I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Current on-hand 28 + in-transit 173 = 201 units; that roughly covers but is slightly below (1+L)*recent demand, so these parameters push the OR engine to target the higher recent demand while letting the backend compute L from observed lead times and scale mu/sigma to the chosen review+lead horizon.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=263. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence: 2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5) so I let the backend compute the average from observed arrivals (method=calculate). Demand shows a sustained upshift starting Period 4 through 11 (carry-over noted): recent regime demand is materially higher than the small-sample historic series, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (N=8, the detected regime length). This increases coverage for (1+L) periods of demand and raises safety stock to protect service given variable lead times and substantial in-transit pipeline, while avoiding excessive additional holding cost by limiting N to the regime length.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=23, in-transit=202 (pipeline=225) \u2014 ample units in flight but observe variable lead times historically (1\u20132 periods). Concluded arrivals show recent shortening to 1 period (P17 and P19 arrivals had lead_time=1) so I use recent lead-time averaging to capture this shift. Demand has been elevated versus long-run (carry-over insight from Period 12) and recent demand samples remain high; I use the last 5 demand periods to capture the current regime and volatility. These choices (recent_N for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat) let the OR backend target a base-stock tuned to the current faster deliveries and higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding given carrying pipeline.

Observed lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); I let backend compute average observed lead time to capture this variability. Demand shows a sustained upward regime since Period 4 (recent average \u224882.5 vs historical \u224859); I use a recent-N forecast to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the high-demand regime (captures last 8 periods of demand). These choices raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts under the higher demand while sigma_hat recentization reflects elevated demand variability, balancing service level versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=322. Historical concluded lead times (9 samples) average \u22481.56 periods; promised=2 but observed drift and some 1-period arrivals\u2014use calculate to let backend set L=~1.56. Demand has shown a sustained upward regime (Period4\u201311 avg\u224882.5 vs historical mean\u224859 per carry-over); recent demand remains elevated (most recent 8 demand samples avg \u2248 ~80). To capture the recent higher mean and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures the post-changepoint regime). These settings increase target base-stock to reduce stockouts given in-transit uncertainty while keeping sigma based on recent volatility so holding cost impact is controlled.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=31, in-transit=210; pipeline comfortably covers multiple weeks but demand has run consistently above historical mean (previous carry-over: sustained +40% regime starting Period 4\u201311). Recent observed lead times vary 1\u20132 periods. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of concluded lead times. Demand forecasting uses EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.3) to weight recent high-demand periods more heavily while retaining historical information. Volatility uses 'default' so the OR engine scales std over the (1+L) horizon. These settings raise the base stock to reflect the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma conservative; this balances higher service level (avoid lost sales) against low holding cost ($1/unit) and large pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=296 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times mix 1 and 2 periods (average \u22481.64) so use calculated average lead time. Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime previously detected (Period 4\u201311, regime_length=8); to capture that shift I use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the higher recent demand while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand volatile but generally elevated versus early history; on-hand=0, in-transit=317 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); I choose to have backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate) to reflect true recent supplier behaviour. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand samples) so mu_hat reflects the current summer demand regime and avoids dilution by older low-demand weeks. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices let the OR engine set base_stock tuned to recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand elevated versus historical baseline (recent weeks show frequent 50\u2013100+ weekly sales; last 8 demands = [51,67,101,59,81,99,47,48], avg \u2248 69.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=317 => healthy pipeline but arrivals are observed with variable lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods). I set L by averaging observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period variability). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the current higher-demand regime (captures recent mean and volatility over the last 8 weeks). These choices size the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the demonstrated higher demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility and avoiding excess holding cost given existing in-transit units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=60, in-transit=223. Concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed average \u22481.75) including a 3-period outlier; demand regime shift was previously recorded (Periods 4\u201311: +40%). To capture the sustained higher recent demand while being robust to lead-time variability, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend average \u22481.75). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the recent higher-demand regime (N chosen = reported regime length 8). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 so volatility reflects recent variation. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service level under the higher recent demand while keeping variance and lead-time estimate data-driven to avoid overstocking from a single outlier shipment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weekly demand has been variable (last 4 concluded demands: 47,48,34,63) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=223. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed lead times: 2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,3; avg=1.75). In-transit (223) currently provides cover vs. typical weekly demand (~50s\u2013100s) but arrivals are delayed/variable. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses the empirical average lead time (~1.75). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost given variable lead times and substantial pipeline inventory.

Observed concluded lead times (12 samples) average \u22481.75 and recent trend ~1.8, so I let the backend compute the average lead time from observed history (method=calculate). Demand shows a sustained higher regime already captured in carry-over; no new changepoint detected, so use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine size the base stock while respecting observed lead-time variability and current pipeline coverage.

Recent demand shows mixed signals (last 6 demands = [47,48,34,63,70,34], mean\u224849). To balance service (large in-transit) against holding cost, keep promised lead time and use a short recent window to reflect current lower recent demand. Selected L=default to trust promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=6) to capture the most recent demand regime and reduce orders given substantial pipeline inventory.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed sequence avg \u22481.77 periods) with occasional 1\u20133 period outcomes; use 'calculate' so L reflects the empirical average of concluded lead times. No new sustained demand regime change detected since prior insight; use default demand/statistics to avoid overfitting short-term noise. With L set to calculated average, using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, balancing service level given large pipeline vs holding cost.

Observed concluded lead times (many periods) average \u22481.77; recent observations also cluster near 2. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend will use the empirical average. Demand shows no new sustained shift since the previously recorded regime change, and pipeline is large, so use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps orders conservative given high pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Recent demand (Periods 24\u201332) shows a moderate regime (~47 units/week); earlier carry-over noted a sustained higher regime in Periods 4\u201311 but recent 9 weeks better represent current demand. Observed lead times vary (1\u20133); use the empirical average of observed lead times. Set L by calculating average observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 9 periods) so the OR backend sizes base stock to current demand volatility while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. This balances service vs holding given uncertain arrivals/in-transit pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=286 units (covers multiple weeks at current demand). Observed concluded lead times (historical arrivals) show variability (1\u20133), average \u22481.75 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To keep forecasts responsive to current demand level, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (captures the post-regime demand).

Demand history shows a sustained regime shift recorded earlier; I let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample set (default mu/sigma) so the backend's base-stock formula and cap incorporate the adjusted L and full-sample demand statistics. This balances service (accounting for slightly shorter observed LT) and holding cost given large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=267. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sample lead_times average \u22481.8 periods with values {1,2,3}), so I use calculate to let the backend adopt the empiric average rather than the promised 2. Demand history includes an earlier sustained regime shift (Periods 4\u201311) but recent weeks (Periods 29\u201336) are lower and noisy; therefore use default demand and volatility estimators (all samples) so the backend's (1+L) scaling uses full history. These settings balance service (using observed shorter-than-promised average lead time) against holding cost by avoiding overstating lead time-driven safety stock while letting OR compute z* from profit vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=279. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent demand (Periods 30\u201337) is lower than the earlier sustained high regime. I choose L='calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the last 8 weeks' lower demand (mean \u224834.25) and reduce overstating needs from older high-demand periods. Sigma set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent lower volatility. This keeps orders tuned to current demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid under/over-ordering given large in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=4, in-transit=267 -> ample pipeline but arrivals have shown variable lead times (1\u20133). I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time pattern (recent avg \u22482 periods) rather than promised=2 or long-run average. Demand has shown regime shifts historically; recent weeks are different from early-run samples, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to make the OR backend forecast using the latest demand mean/volatility (short window) so orders better match current demand and reduce holding costs while preserving service level.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=14, in-transit=247 (healthy pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (history shows 17 observed lead times summing to 31 \u2192 avg \u22481.82). No new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded Period 4\u201311 shift; recent lead times fluctuate (1\u20133) so use the observed-average estimate. Use backend defaults for demand mean/volatility so the OR engine applies all historical demand samples ((1+L) scaling) and balances service vs holding given profit/holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=7, In-transit=258 \u2014 pipeline far exceeds expected (L+1) periods of demand, so no emergency ordering required. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) but promised lead time remains 2; recent sustained demand regime shift was already recorded in carry-over insights (Period 12). I use default lead time (promised) so the OR backend applies its lead-time estimate; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock while letting the OR engine incorporate the dataset-wide demand signal and service-level tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent observed weekly demand is low (Periods 34\u201341: mostly single- to low-double digits), while pipeline inventory is large (on-hand 4 + in-transit 263 = 267). No sustained change in lead time is confirmed by concludes (mixed 1\u20133), so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N = 8 (focus on the last 8 demand observations) and estimate sigma_hat from the same recent window. This reduces order targets vs. full-history averages and avoids overstock given heavy in-transit inventory and low holding cost sensitivity (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=263 \u2014 large pipeline likely arriving but some past shipments showed variable lead times (1\u20133 periods). Recent demand (last 9 concluded periods P34\u2013P42) averages \u224814.6/week, noticeably lower than earlier-season spikes. I set L to be computed from observed lead times to capture the variable history. I use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the most recent low-demand regime (captures current slower demand and recent variance). These choices keep the backend base-stock tight to avoid excess holding given holding cost $1 and modest current demand, while using observed lead-time average to protect against further delays.

Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20133; average of observed lead times \u22481.89 \u2192 use calculated average to reflect actual behavior. Demand has had a prior sustained regime shift (recorded earlier) but recent weeks (last 8 periods) show lower/variable demand; use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects current lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-23. Recent demand shows elevated holiday/weekend activity; last 8 demands = [8,10,7,3,14,33,57,78], mean=26.25/week. Promised lead time 2 used. (1+L)=3 => recent_N mu_hat forecast = 3 * 26.25 = 78.75. In-transit=263 units well above the 3-period demand forecast (\u224879), so no additional safety stock is needed to avoid excess holding cost. I choose recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent holiday regime while keeping L at default to respect the promised lead time; this minimizes unnecessary ordering and holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been elevated (Dec weeks: 33,57,78,107) and prior carry-over flagged a sustained +40% regime shift starting earlier in the year. On-hand=0, in-transit=263 (pipeline large). Observed lead times vary 1\u20133; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to weight recent elevated demand while covering review+lead period. Keep sigma_hat as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit units.
