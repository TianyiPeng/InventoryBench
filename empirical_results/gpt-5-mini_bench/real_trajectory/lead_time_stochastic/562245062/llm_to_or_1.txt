Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend over 5 weeks (59,78,96,123,144; mean=100). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for 3-period coverage (promised L=2). I use L: default (promised lead time=2) because no concluded arrivals exist to revise lead time. I use mu_hat: default so backend sets (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=3\xd7100=300, providing coverage for review+lead period while reflecting historical mean. I use sigma_hat: default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with current upward demand signal while avoiding overreacting to a short series of increases.

Carry-over insight: Demand increasing over 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04: weekly series 59\u219278\u219296\u2192123\u2192144 (mean=100); latest week +144% vs first week.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand shows a clear rising pattern (series 59\u219278\u219296\u2192123\u2192144, mean\u2248100; Period1 demand=107). On-hand=0, in-transit=157. Promised L=2 has no contradicting conclude evidence (Period1 order not expected to arrive until Period3 conclude), so keep promised lead time. To capture the upward demand trend use recent_N over the 5 most recent samples for demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) so the base-stock reflects the higher recent mean and variability. This increases service level to avoid stockouts while the OR engine caps orders; default lead time lets the OR engine apply promised L=2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=309; two recent concluded periods show demand 107 (P1) and 75 (P2) plus prior weekly series 59\u219278\u219296\u2192123\u2192144 indicating elevated recent demand. No concluded arrivals beyond P2, so cannot confirm lead-time shift\u2014use promised lead time. To capture recent demand regime while being robust to noise, set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 concluded demand samples). Keep sigma_hat default to reflect overall historical variability and let OR backend scale for lead time. This balances service (capture recent uptick) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded history shows three consecutive decision-period orders (P1:157, P2:152, P3:62) with arrived=0, suggesting actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods or shipments may be lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=371. Demand history (seed samples) shows 2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04: 59,78,96,123,144 (mean=100). Recent realized demand in concluded periods: P1=107, P2=75, P3=52 \u2014 weaker recent sell-through but insufficient to conclusively shift regime. To be conservative vs. potential delayed/lost shipments, set lead time explicitly longer so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. For demand forecast use the full recent sample set (N=5) to capture the upward trend through early Feb while smoothing the noisy realized sells. Volatility estimated from the same recent 5 samples. These choices aim to raise target pipeline to cover extended lead-time risk while keeping mu_hat grounded in the established sample mean to avoid overstock if short-term sell-through anomalies reverse.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (P1:157, P2:152, P3:62) have not concluded as arrived by Period 3 conclude\u2014evidence of lead time >2 periods or missing shipments (3 consecutive non-arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand trend (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) shows increasing demand with mean=100. On-hand=86, in-transit=311 (includes P2 arrival of 152 confirmed). Orders from P1 (157) and P3 (62) remain unconcluded by Period 4 conclude, indicating possible lost shipments or longer-than-promised lead time. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative given missing shipments (protect service). With L=3, (1+L)=4 and I forecast mu_hat explicit=400 (4\xd7mean100) to cover review+lead demand. Volatility estimated from sample std (\u224834.08) scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 gives sigma_hat explicit\u224868.16 to reflect increased uncertainty; this increases safety stock to balance lost-shipment risk vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time uncertainty: P2 observed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4), but orders from P1 (157 units) and P3 (62 units) remained unconcluded by Period 4 conclude \u2192 evidence of lost shipments or lead_time\u22653.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand: historical sample series (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) showed a strong upward trend (59\u2192144, mean=100), but realized store-week demands in game history have moderated (Period1-5 demands: 107,75,52,66,55). On-hand=31, in-transit=372 (large pipeline but several prior orders did not conclude on-time). Lead-time evidence: one concluded arrival gives lead_time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4). However multiple earlier orders (P1=157, P3=62) did not conclude on expected schedule, indicating shipment loss risk. To be conservative and responsive to recent realized demand, set L using calculated observed lead times (backend-average) so OR honors observed arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (use the last 5 observed demand periods) to capture the recent lower realized demand while still reflecting short-term variability. This balances service (avoid excess ordering given potential lost shipments) with holding cost by scaling forecasts to recent actual sales rather than earlier promotional spike.

Carry-over insight: Lead time uncertainty: P1 (ordered 157) and P3 (ordered 62) remained unconcluded through Period 4 conclude despite P2 concluding with lead_time=2; evidence of possible lost shipments or intermittent lead_time>=3 across 3 consecutive non-arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand series shows an increasing trend (samples mean=100 over 2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04). Lead-time observations: Period 4 conclude shows P2 lead_time=2; Period 6 conclude shows P5 lead_time=1; P1 and P3 shipments remain unconcluded (possible lost shipments or intermittent long LT). To balance uncertain LT while leveraging observed evidence, set L to calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the upward demand in the provided samples. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility across (1+L). This combination accounts for observed shorter/longer arrivals while raising forecasted demand for the recent upward trend.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. Recent concluded lead times: observed 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) => use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability and possible intermittent faster shipments. Demand history shows upward trend in the Jan samples but recent fulfilled weekly demand (Periods 4-7) is lower; to let the OR engine combine historical sample mean with chosen L, use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service-level bias (profit/holding -> high q) against holding cost while acknowledging lead-time uncertainty and prior missed/non-concluded shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (multiple past orders not yet concluded). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2192 use average to reflect uncertainty. Recent demand (Periods 1\u20138 concludes) = [107,75,52,66,55,58,55,64], mean=66.5; use recent_N=8 to capture current lower-rate regime versus the older 2019-Jan ramp. Setting L as calculated average of observed lead times balances intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat bases the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 periods, helping the OR backend size orders to meet near-term demand while avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

I choose L.method="calculate" so backend uses average of observed lead times (captures recent 2 and 1). Demand shows no new sustained regime since prior notes; use mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting OR balance service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1 under the inferred average lead time. This keeps parameters conservative given lead-time uncertainty and existing in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 but past history shows intermittent arrivals and some lost/very-delayed shipments. Recent realized demand has fallen vs initial sample (last 5 periods demands: 58,55,64,52,43 \u2192 mean \u224854.4). To be conservative given lead-time variability, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (let backend average observed lead times). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods to capture the downward regime, and compute volatility from the same recent window. These choices reduce overstating required inventory while recognizing variable lead time and protecting service with a recent-data-driven base stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has fallen from the early-sample mean (~100) to ~50 over the last 5 weeks (P7-P11: 55,64,52,43,38). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (some earlier orders concluded, some remained missing \u2192 intermittent/uncertain lead times). Observed concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1; some earlier orders never concluded. I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 observations rather than trusting promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the latest 5-week lower-demand regime. Similarly use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given lower recent demand while allowing lead-time averaging to capture intermittent faster deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: early-sample mean=100 (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) to recent mean=50.4 (Periods 7\u201311: 55,64,52,43,38), approx -49.6%

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has fallen vs early sample (Periods 7\u201311 weekly demand = 55,64,52,43,38). Concluded lead times are mixed (observed P2 lead_time=2, P5 lead_time=1) and several earlier orders remained unconcluded\u2014indicating intermittent short lead times with some lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures observed 1 and 2 period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (periods 7\u201311) to reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base stock to match the lower recent demand while letting the backend infer lead-time from observed conclusions, helping avoid overstock given possible lost shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has fallen materially vs early-sample (early mean ~100; recent periods show ~50s). Concluded lead-time observations: one order showed L=2 (P2\u2192P4) and one L=1 (P5\u2192P6); some earlier orders never concluded, indicating intermittent lost/delayed shipments but only two confirmed lead-time observations. To be conservative, set L method to 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times. For demand, detect a sustained lower-demand regime starting around Period 7; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (captures the recent low-demand regime length) so the OR engine targets a smaller (1+L)-period demand forecast and reduced safety stock. This balances service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1 by lowering forecasted base-stock in light of the ~50% demand drop and uncertain arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has fallen vs early sample: last 8 weeks demand = [55,64,52,43,38,27,59,63], mean \u224850.1 (\u2248-50% vs early mean=100). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed/uncertain. In-transit is large (311) while on-hand is 0, suggesting past orders still en route or partially lost; to be conservative use observed average lead time. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to let backend adapt to mixed evidence. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime (use the last 8 periods to capture current mean/volatility). This reduces overstock risk given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (high service target but avoid large holding from obsolete forecasts).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand is well below the early-sample (mean fell ~50%); on-hand=0, in-transit=311 with several prior orders never concluding -> lead-time uncertainty. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (uses concluded orders only) rather than blindly trusting promised L=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (most recent 9 observed weekly demands, captures the lower-demand regime from Periods 7\u201315). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand while allowing the OR engine to account for observed lead-time behavior, balancing service level vs holding cost under lead-time uncertainty.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed lead times: 2 and 1 periods (mixed); use averaged inferred lead time to let backend smooth between 1\u20132. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 (last 10 demand observations, captures the sustained lower-demand regime) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand while pipeline inventory prevents immediate stockouts. This balances service level (use recent demand estimate) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime vs early-sample; last 5 observed demands (Periods 13\u201317) = 59,63,74,48,34, mean=55.6. Several earlier orders failed to conclude on promised LT=2 (P1 and P3 remain unconcluded despite some other orders concluding with LT=1\u20132) \u2014 evidence of intermittent longer or lost shipments. To protect service given in-transit=311 and uncertain arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative > promised). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=5 matches the most recent coherent sample block). These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for (1+L) periods of the current lower mean while inflating safety stock based on recent volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 7 (weekly demands P7\u2013P18 mean \u224849.7 vs early-sample mean=100). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (large pipeline but earlier periods show intermittent/concluded arrivals and some lost shipments). Lead time observations: observed concluded lead_times = {P4:2, P6:1} \u2192 average ~1.5. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect intermittent faster/slower arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 7\u201318) because a sustained downward regime is evident for 12 periods; this anchors mu_hat to recent lower demand. I use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the current lower demand while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time behavior and pipeline.

Observed concluded lead times: one order with LT=2 (P2\u2192P4) and one with LT=1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 intermittent arrivals, so use calculated average lead time rather than assuming promised LT. Set L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times. Forecast demand using recent regime: choose mu_hat recent_N with N=13 (using last 13 demand observations, matches detected low-demand regime) so (1+L)\xd7recent mean captures current lower demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given large in-transit stock while keeping service targeted to the lower recent demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has fallen markedly from the early-sample mean (~100) to much lower levels in the most recent 10 weeks (Periods 12\u201321). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (large pipeline from prior orders). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed evidence; some earlier orders remained unconcluded but not enough new consistent lead-time observations to declare a persistent shift. To capture the recent lower demand regime while letting the backend infer average observed lead time, I set L="calculate". For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 12\u201321) so mu_hat reflects the current low-demand regime and reduces overstock risk given holding cost. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while letting the OR engine use observed lead-time average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: early-sample mean=100 (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) \u2192 recent mean=38.8 (Periods 12\u201321: demands 27,59,63,74,48,34,39,25,10,9), change \u2248 -61.2%

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=311. Historical demand has fallen substantially from early mean\u2248100 to recent ~39 (Periods 12\u201321); recent low-demand regime persists. Lead-time history is noisy (observed lead_times: 2, 1; several past orders unconcluded), so use empirical average of observed lead times. Choose mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent samples to reflect the new lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking given holding cost >0.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=311. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2192 evidence of variable but on average ~1.5. Demand has fallen from initial mean ~100 to a sustained lower regime; most recent 5-week demand (Periods19\u201323: 25,10,9,26,35) averages ~21. To be conservative vs holding cost and account for variable lead time, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (average) and use recent demand statistics (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets current low-demand regime while the calculated L lets the backend reflect empirical lead-time variability. This balances service level (avoid overstock given low demand) and holding cost, while pipeline (311 units) will be reconciled by backend ordering cap.

Demand has downshifted from early mean\u2248100 to recent much lower levels (~39\u201350).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been much lower than the early sample. Last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 21\u201325): 9,26,35,17,41 (mean=25.6) vs early-sample mean=100, so I use a recent-window forecast. Observed concluded lead times: one 2-period (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period (P5\u2192P6) => average observed LT=1.5, so I set L via calculate to let backend use observed history. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new lower-demand regime (captures most recent variability). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=311 \u2014 we have pipeline cover but lost/intermittent arrivals earlier justify relying on observed LT average rather than promised. These settings bias orders toward current low demand (reduce holding cost) while L from observed data informs required pipeline coverage.

Recent demand has fallen from early mean ~100 to much lower levels (periods 12\u201326 average \u224839); current on-hand=0, in-transit=311 (large outstanding pipeline, some shipments previously unconcluded). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (evidence: observed lead_times = 2 and 1 \u2192 mean 1.5) to reflect actual variability. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=15 (periods 12\u201326) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent low-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=15 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices reduce target inventory versus early high-demand estimates while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and large existing pipeline, limiting additional overstock given holding cost >0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has fallen substantially vs early sample (historic series mean=100 then declined); current on-hand=0, in-transit=311 (multiple past orders showed intermittent arrivals: observed lead_times from concluded orders = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6)). There is evidence of irregular/mixed lead times and some lost/unconcluded shipments, so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). I use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, letting it balance service-level (via profit/holding tradeoff) against holding costs given the inferred L and the full historical samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Recent demand is lower than early-sample (recent volatility and mean changed); last five realized weekly demands (Periods 24\u201328) = [17,41,58,91,87], indicating current mean ~58.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=311 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {P2\u2192P4:2, P5\u2192P6:1} (no sustained single new lead-time). I set L by averaging recent observed lead times to reflect possible variability (recent_N N=2). For demand forecast and risk, I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets current lower-demand regime while accounting for recent variability; this avoids over-ordering given large in-transit inventory and holding cost >0. The choices bias orders toward current demand levels and moderate service given supply uncertainty.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=311. Historical concluded lead times: observed 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2192 mixed/unstable. Recent demand has risen sharply in the last 4 weeks (Periods 26\u201329: 58,91,87,72). To balance service vs holding cost given uncertain lead time but clear recent demand upswing, I set L to be data-driven (calculate average observed lead times). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the new higher-demand regime; I choose N=7 (covering the most recent 7 demand observations to be responsive while smoothing noise). I apply the same recent_N window for sigma_hat so volatility reflects the most recent regime. These parameters push the OR backend toward a higher base-stock that covers the (1+L) review+lead horizon while letting the capped order limit constrain excessive orders given in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift beginning Period 26: recent 4-week mean (Periods 26\u201329) = 77.0 vs prior recent mean \u224838.8 (+98%), sustained 4 periods \u2014 demand appears to have moved to a higher regime.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has risen starting Period 26: weeks 26\u201330 = [58,91,87,72,89], signalling a higher regime. In-transit=311 units provide coverage but past arrivals were intermittent; observed lead times include 2 and 1 periods, so use backend's calculated average lead time. Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new higher-demand regime (reduce bias from older low-demand periods). These choices increase target base-stock to meet the renewed demand while letting the OR engine account for promised lead time and variability.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has risen since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201331: 58,91,87,72,89,101; recent regime mean \u224879.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N over the detected higher-demand regime (Periods 26\u201331, length=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) while pipeline inventory (311) will cap ordering via OR backend cap, limiting excess orders and holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand (Periods 26\u201332) shows a sustained higher regime: weekly demands = [58,91,87,72,89,101,101], mean \u224885.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (outstanding long-dated shipments; several past orders did not conclude on time), so actual lead time appears intermittently >2 or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative vs. missing/delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicit=3 periods. Forecast (mu_hat) set explicitly to (1+L)*recent_mean \u22484*85.57 \u2248342.3 to cover review+lead demand under the higher recent regime. Volatility will use recent_N over the last 7 weeks (Periods 26\u201332) to reflect current variability. These choices prioritize service given high recent demand while accounting for delayed arrivals; the OR backend cap will still limit excessive orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has clearly shifted up since Period 26 (weeklies 58,91,87,72,89,101,101,149). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 units (sufficient buffer). Observed concluded lead times = {1,2} (orders that concluded); I use the average of observed lead times. Demand forecast uses the recent high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201333) to capture the new mean and volatility. Chosen methods: L by calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N with N=8 (Periods 26\u201333), so the OR backend targets the higher regime and balances service level (higher z* from profit/holding) against holding cost given ample in-transit stock.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) => intermittent 1\u20132 periods; several recent orders (e.g. P33) remain unconcluded but evidence is mixed. Demand has shifted up starting Period 26 (sustained regime through Periods 26\u201333). To reflect recent higher demand while letting backend infer average lead time from observed concludes, I set L to 'calculate' (backend averages observed lead times). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=8, corresponding to the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 26\u201333) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent elevated mean and variance and help the OR engine raise target stock while capping order size to limit exposure to missing shipments.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand has risen since Period 26 and remains strong in Periods 30\u201335 (weekly demands: 89,101,101,149,131,115). Given sustained higher recent demand, use a recent_N demand estimate covering the latest 6 weeks to capture current regime. Keep lead time at promised default (no clear new consistent lead-time estimate from concluded arrivals; some earlier intermittent delays but P2/P5 concluded with L=2/1). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for the new demand regime while relying on promised lead time to avoid overcompensating for intermittent past shipment issues.

Carry-over insight: Demand increased further in Periods 30\u201335: mean=114.3 (Periods 30\u201335) vs prior confirmed regime mean=95.8 (+19.2%), sustained 6 periods

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has rebounded strongly since Period 26 with an even higher spike in Periods 30\u201336 (6-period mean \u2248121 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (sizable pipeline but some prior shipments were intermittent). Observed concluded lead times = {1,2,3} (avg=2.0) so I use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed realizations. To capture the current high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 31\u201336) so the backend bases base-stock on the current elevated demand and recent volatility while the averaged lead time balances intermittent short and long arrivals. This choice aims to raise target inventory to meet the renewed high demand while limiting excess inventory by using a short recent window for mean/volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 26 (sustained elevated weekly demand; recent weeks 30\u201337 show large values up to 149). Lead time has been variable with observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P36:3} and several earlier non-arrivals, so use a short recent average to reflect variability. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time samples. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime from Period 26 through Period 37. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward satisfying the new, higher demand while the short L estimate guards against over-committing inventory given intermittent longer/shorter arrivals and missing shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand 0, in-transit 318. Recent concluded lead times are variable (observed: 2,1,3,1 \u2192 avg ~1.75) so use averaged lead time to capture this volatility. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 26; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 34\u201338 = 131,115,130,132,113) show a high recent mean, so use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the base-stock responsive to the new regime. This keeps service high (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 high critical fractile) while using recent volatility to limit over-ordering given in-transit stock and past shipment irregularity.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime is high and volatile (recent weekly demands include 149,131,115,130,132,113,80) \u2014 demand elevated vs early 2019. On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (large pipeline) so avoid over-ordering. Lead times have been inconsistent (observed concluded lead_times = 2,1,3,3); use a short recent average to capture variability. Choose L as recent_N over last 4 observed lead times to reflect current intermittent 1\u20133 period behavior. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (most recent 8 weeks show elevated mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to current high-demand regime while capping orders given existing large in-transit pipeline, balancing service level (profit $4) against holding cost ($1).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,3,1,3} (avg=2.0). To balance service vs holding given Profit=$4, Holding=$1, I set L=calculate to use the average observed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 8 demand samples (recent_N N=8) to reflect the higher recent regime while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and capped order sizes. This keeps orders responsive to the elevated recent demand while the backend caps order quantities to control holding costs given the large in-transit volume.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 26 with strong weekly demand in recent weeks (Periods 36\u201341 demand = 130,132,113,80,68,70; recent 6-week mean \u224898.8). Lead times have been intermittent but, using concluded arrivals only, observed lead_times = [2,1,3,1,3,2] (average 2.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=319. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures intermittent 1\u20133 behavior but centers at 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 6 samples). These parameters push the OR backend to hold more stock for the sustained higher demand while respecting observed lead-time variability and limiting excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Actual observed lead time average = 2.0 periods (observed lead_times: 2,1,3,1,3,2).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand shows a strong upward regime since Period 26 with a large spike in Period 42 (d=327). On-hand=0, in-transit=340 (will be available in future periods). Historical observed lead times vary but recent summary (Period 42) reports average ~2.0. To capture the recent high-demand regime while respecting observed lead-time behavior: set L to be calculated from observed lead-times (lets backend infer average); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (N=8 covers Periods ~35\u201342 where demand has been elevated), so the OR backend will target a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during this elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances higher service level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical lead times show variability but average ~2.0; recent arrivals include some 3-period delays and intermittent non-arrivals, so use calculated average lead time to let backend blend observed LT. Demand has shifted up since Period 26 with large recent spikes (notably Period 42 demand=327 and Period 43 demand=133); to capture the recent higher regime while still smoothing noise, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the most recent 10 demand samples). This produces a forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility that bias ordering toward meeting elevated recent demand while relying on backend caps to limit excessive orders given pipeline=503.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows large pipeline (503 in-transit) after multiple intermittent arrivals and demand spikes (notably Period 42 demand=327 and elevated demands in Periods 30\u201337). Lead-time observations have been mixed but average recently ~2; several shipments showed delays/intermittency. To let the OR engine use its promised lead time while biasing demand toward recent elevated demand, I choose default lead time (promised) so backend applies its lead-time handling, use an EWMA for mu_hat to weight recent spikes more (>traditional mean) with gamma=0.3, and leave sigma_hat as default (backend computes volatility across history). This balances service for the current large pipeline and recent demand spikes while avoiding overreacting to single delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=128, in-transit=311. Historical observed lead times show variability but average ~2.0; recent demand has moved to a higher regime since Period 26 with a large holiday spike (P42=327) and elevated weeks (P43=133,P45=64). To reflect confirmed average lead time use calculated average lead time. To capture the recent upshift and Holiday-week volatility, set demand forecast using a recent-window estimate (N=8 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher-demand regime and short-term variance. These choices aim to let the OR backend size base-stock for (1+L) review+lead coverage while avoiding overreaction to single-week noise.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
562245062: ordered=34, arrived=0, starting on-hand inventory=128, demand=46, sold=46, ending on-hand inventory=82

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=82, in-transit=345 \u2014 pipeline is large so avoid aggressive replenishment. Observed lead-times in history vary but average recently ~2; use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead-times. Demand has shifted to a higher regime in recent months (sustained elevated weekly demand since Period 26 with several large weeks and one extreme spike in Period 42). To capture recent elevated mean and higher short-term variability while avoiding overreaction to a single outlier, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (focus on last ~8 demand samples to reflect current regime). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.
