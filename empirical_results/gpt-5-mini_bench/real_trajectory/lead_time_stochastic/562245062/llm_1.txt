With LT=2, in-transit inventory will arrive in upcoming weeks and will cover multiple periods of demand. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is high relative to profit ($4/unit), so avoid excess ordering that would create holding losses. Forecast next (L+1)=3 periods demand \u2248 50\u201370/week \u2192 ~150\u2013210 units. Since in-transit (795) far exceeds this short-term need, place no new order to avoid holding cost and potential overstocks.",
