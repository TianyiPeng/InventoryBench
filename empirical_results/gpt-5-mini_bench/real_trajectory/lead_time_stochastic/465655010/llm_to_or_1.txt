Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [175, 46, 37, 127, 216] show no sustained regime shift (no 3+ periods of consistent increase/decrease). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so there are no overdue arrivals or lost-shipment signals. Promised lead time is 2 periods and no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding cost; defaults avoid overfitting to latest noisy spike (216) while providing moderate cover for lead time + review period demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=250 (order placed Period 1). No concluded arrivals yet; this is expected given promised L=2 (P1 order will arrive during P3 and be visible on a later conclude). Historical demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~120.2. I retain the promised lead time (no evidence of changed lead time or lost shipment yet) and use default demand/volatility settings so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively until arrival behavior or demand regime shifts are confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) show mean ~120.2 units/week; with promised lead time 2, the (1+L) horizon is 3 weeks. Two recent conclude messages show no arrivals for recent orders but this is not yet a sustained lead-time change (only 2 periods); shipments may be delayed or lost but evidence is insufficient to override promised lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=321 which is slightly below the default forecasted 3-week demand (~360), so I keep default demand/uncertainty settings to let the OR engine compute base-stock while preserving its cap logic. Using default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat keeps decisions aligned with historical demand while remaining conservative about possible shipment issues.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=321 (orders from P1+P2). Historical weekly samples (Jan): [175,46,37,127,216]. Recent concluded periods show demand 41,20,6. Promised lead time = 2 and no arrivals have been concluded yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. To avoid overfitting to the small recent dips and since lead time evidence is insufficient, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service (use full-sample mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=250 (includes orders from P1 and others). History shows P2 order (71) arrived with lead_time=2 (P2->P4). P1 order (250) has not concluded by P5 and is likely lost/delayed. Demand recent sequence (Periods 1-4): 41,20,6,147 \u2014 high variability with a single large spike in P4. I retain promised lead time (default) because observed lead time=2 was confirmed for P2 order; however missing P1 shipment is noted in carry-over. To make the OR backend responsive to the recent demand pattern I use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the recent spike and lower earlier weeks). This balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost: backend will compute z* accordingly. Using recent_N keeps forecast responsive to the P4 surge while not over-committing to long-term historical means.

Carry-over insight: Order placed in Period 1 (250 units) has not concluded by Period 5 (overdue by \u22652 periods) and is likely lost/delayed; observed lead_time confirmed as 2 periods for Period 2 order (71 units arrived P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=250 (Period1 order still not concluded and likely lost/delayed); observed arrival from Period2 confirmed actual lead_time=2. Given one confirmed observed lead-time of 2, set L by calculating average observed lead times. Recent demand shows two high weeks (P4=147, P5=190) but this is not yet a sustained (3+ period) regime shift versus historical samples, so use default demand moments ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to avoid overfitting to a short spike. This keeps the OR base-stock conservative: accounts for confirmed lead time while avoiding excessive safety stock from a possibly transient demand spike, balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=302. Historical concluded demands show a clear regime change starting Period 4 (demands 147,190,178) vs earlier low demand (41,20,6). Concluded arrival evidence: Period 4 reported arrival of Period 2 order with lead_time=2. Period 1 order remains overdue/lost. Therefore set lead time by calculating observed lead times (avg=2). For demand forecast use recent_N over the new high-demand regime (Periods 4-6, N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices respond to the sustained increase in weekly demand and the confirmed 2-period lead time while avoiding dilution from earlier low-demand samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows a confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) while an earlier Period 1 order (250) remains missing and likely lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=511 (pipeline large). Demand history shows a regime shift to higher weekly demand beginning Period 4 (147,190,178) then a drop to 59 in Period 7; to be responsive to the recent higher-demand regime I use a recent-window demand forecast. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed L=2). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=4 (uses the most recent 4 demand samples to capture the new higher-demand regime while still including the short dip). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias target base-stock upward to protect service level during the recent high-demand periods while sigma from recent data keeps safety stock appropriate given observed variability; using calculated L accounts for actual observed lead time rather than the promised lead time, and avoids over-ordering against potentially lost earlier shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=244, in-transit=250. Historical concluded lead times: P2->P4=2, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1 (avg ~1.67) and Period1 order remains missing (likely lost). Recent demand shows a regime shift upward around Periods 4-6 (demands 147,190,178) then more volatile afterwards. To be conservative about delivery variability, I set L using the recent 3 observed lead times (captures the 2,2,1 pattern). For demand I target the higher recent regime: mu_hat uses the recent 3-period mean (Periods 4-6) scaled by (1+L) so the OR engine stocks for the elevated demand. sigma_hat uses recent 3 periods to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the missing Period1 shipment.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has shifted higher recently (periods 5-9 show elevated and volatile demand vs earlier samples), so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture current regime while letting backend infer average lead time from observed conclues. Choices: L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on most recent 5 demand periods (captures recent higher demand); sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This prioritizes matching stock to current demand while avoiding overcommitment given lost/delayed shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 178,59,17,51,134) while on-hand=59 and in-transit=250 (note one early 250 order remains unconcluded/likely lost). Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)} so average ~1.67. To capture the recent demand regime and compensate for lost/delayed shipments, I set L by averaging observed lead times and use recent_N (last 5) for demand mean and std to reflect current higher/variable demand; this raises target base-stock to improve service while keeping volatility estimate recent so the cap limits extreme over-ordering.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent demand has been volatile with several large weeks (e.g. 147,190,178,134) and current on-hand=22 plus in-transit=250 (250 likely includes the overdue/lost P1 shipment). Observed concluded lead times: P2->P4=2, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1 \u2014 use the average of observed lead times to let the backend infer effective L. No sustained, multi-period demand regime change detected, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples) so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (capture recent high demands) vs holding cost given current inventory/pipeline uncertainty and possible lost shipment.

Recent demand shows a higher, variable regime; last 5 concluded demands = [51,134,37,16,85], mean=64.6.

I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean will scale forecast to review+lead period). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so volatility reflects recent variability and prevents over/under-stocking given delayed/lost shipments and equal profit/holding costs.

History shows multiple confirmed 2-period lead times (P2->P4, P6->P8, P12->P14) with one 1-period outlier (P7->P8); an early large P1 order (250) remains missing and likely lost/delayed. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5), I use calculated average lead time from observed conclusions to let backend account for realized delays, and use a recent demand window to capture the current higher recent weekly demand (periods 10-14: 134,37,16,85,33 average ~61) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent regime without overreacting to older samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (likely includes some delayed/partial arrivals; Period1 order appears lost). Observed concluded lead_times: 2 (P4 for P2), 2 (P8 for P6), 1 (P8 for P7), 2 (P14 for P12) \u2014 average \u22481.75, so use backend 'calculate' to let it estimate average observed lead time. Recent demand has been variable but the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201315 = 37,16,85,33,8) represent the current regime (mean \u224835.8); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1), and accounting for possible lost shipments by relying on recent realized demand rather than older samples.

Several early periods showed missing arrivals (likely lost shipments) but recent concluded arrivals consistently show ~2 periods. To balance $1 profit vs $1 holding, use inferred average lead time (calculate) so the OR engine increases pipeline coverage; use default demand and volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the backend's base-stock targets reflect full-sample demand while L captures the slightly <2 observed average. This addresses delayed/lost shipment noise by explicitly informing L calculation rather than relying on promised lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/6/10. Recent arrival history shows observed lead times = [2,2,1,2] (avg 1.75) with one lost/overdue earlier order; on-hand=0, in-transit=253. I set L using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent observed lead-time pattern (weighted toward 2). Demand has fallen vs. early-year highs; recent demand samples (Periods 13-17 = [85,33,8,8,9]) show a lower regime, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the latest regime. These choices reduce over-ordering given holding cost equals profit and the pipeline of 253 units, while still reflecting the empirically observed lead-time behavior.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been low (last concludes: 1,9,8,8,33,85 earlier) but historical sample mean from Jan-Feb will be used as baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (covers future demand). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.75; use calculate so backend infers average observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative given mixed recent low demand and existing in-transit stock). This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=253. Recent demand has collapsed vs earlier weeks; last 5 periods (P15\u2013P19) demand = [8,8,9,1,1] (avg 5.4). Historical observed lead times include multiple 2-period arrivals and one 1-period arrival; one early large order appears lost. To reflect confirmed shorter/variable lead times use L method 'calculate' (average of observed lead-times). To capture the new low-demand regime, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to current low demand and avoids excess holding cost despite heavy pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: prior avg (P1\u2013P14) \u224872.4 units/week -> recent avg (P15\u2013P19)=5.4 units/week (Periods 15\u201319 = [8,8,9,1,1])

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime from P15\u2013P19 (8,8,9,1,1) but a large spike at P20 (101) \u2014 unclear if new regime or transient. Observed concluded lead times are mixed but mostly 2 periods; some single-period arrivals occurred earlier. To be conservative about lead time uncertainty, use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand I use a short recent window (N=6: P15\u2013P20) to capture the recent low baseline plus the P20 spike, letting the OR backend scale mu_hat by (1+L). I match sigma_hat to the same recent window to reflect elevated volatility from the spike. These choices balance service (capture risk of another spike) vs holding cost given profit=holding so critical ratio=0.5.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Recent demand: very low episodes in P15\u2013P19 (avg ~5.4) followed by large spikes in P20\u2013P21 (101, 274). On-hand=0, in-transit=253; historically one large order (P1:250) appears lost/delayed and several later orders confirmed with lead_time=2. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (evidence: observed lead_times = 2,2,1,2). To capture the recent shift to high, volatile demand (P15\u2013P21), I use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility emphasize the latest spike while still smoothing earlier low weeks. These choices push the OR engine toward higher base stock to cover the recent demand surge while using observed lead-time behavior rather than the promised value.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15): recent demand has jumped sharply in Periods 20\u201322 (101, 274, 225) after a low-demand run in Periods 15\u201319. On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (covers some upcoming demand). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P8:2, P8:1, P14:2} => use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand regime changed at P20; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the new high-demand regime (last 3 periods avg \u2248200 \xd7 (1+L) scaling handled by backend). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (capture new spike) while relying on in-transit stock to avoid immediate overordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg increased from 5.4 (P15\u2013P19) to 200.0 (P20\u2013P22) (+~3600%)

Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=600. Recent history shows a clear demand regime shift starting Period 20 with high weekly demand (Periods 20\u201323 = [101,274,225,145]). Some past shipments were lost/delayed but recent concluded arrivals show lead times around 1\u20132; to be conservative use observed average. Set L via calculate (average observed lead times) to capture realized supplier behavior. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent high-demand periods (P20\u2013P23) so the base stock anticipates the sustained spike. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect volatility during this new high-demand regime. These parameters prioritize service (avoid stockouts during the current high-demand regime) while sigma and L from recent observations limit overordering given in-transit inventory and past lost shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 20 (P20\u2013P24 demands = [101,274,225,145,209]); on-hand=0, in-transit=600 (pending arrivals include P23 order=347 which has not yet concluded). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2 (P2\u2192P4), P8:2 (P6\u2192P8), P8:1 (P7\u2192P8), P14:2 (P12\u2192P14)} \u2192 mean \u22481.75. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use average observed lead time (captures mixed 1\u20132 period evidence). Demand forecast: use recent_N with N=5 (use the 5-period high-demand regime P20\u2013P24) so mu_hat targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean to cover review+lead demand. Volatility: recent_N N=5 to reflect variability in the new high-demand regime. This prioritizes service (profit and stock availability) during the sustained spike while acknowledging elevated variance and existing in-transit stock; carry-over notes about prior lost shipments are considered but not strong enough to override calculated L.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): demand has shifted to a high regime since Period 20 (large weekly demands P20\u2013P25). On-hand=0, in-transit=600 (covers upcoming demand but includes previously flagged possibly-lost earlier orders). Observed concluded lead times cluster around 2 with occasional 1; I use calculated average lead time to let backend infer from observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201325) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while allowing the OR engine cap to limit overly large orders given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 20 (periods 20\u201326: demands = [101,274,225,145,209,154,71], recent avg \u2248168/week) versus prior low regime (P15\u2013P19 avg\u22485.4). On-hand = 276, in-transit = 253. Promised lead time is 2; observed lead times have varied (mostly 2, occasional 1 and 3) but not consistently different from 2, so I keep L at the promised default to avoid overreacting to a single 3-period arrival. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (the recent high-demand regime length) so the OR backend bases base-stock on the current elevated demand and its recent volatility; this increases orders to meet the sustained higher demand while the default L prevents over-ordering for a presumed longer lead time. Carry-over notes show the regime change to elevated demand; no new sustained lead-time confirmation yet.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand jumped (Periods 20\u201327 include many large spikes: 101,274,225,145,209,154,71,200) after a low-demand regime (P15\u2013P19). On-hand=76 + in-transit=253 provides ~329 units available soon. Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,2,3] \u2192 average = 2. I set L=calculate to use the average observed lead time (stable central tendency despite one 3-period event). With L=2 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all historical samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given current profit=holding=$1. This keeps ordering responsive to the large recent demand while not overcommitting to the single 3-period anomaly.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has transitioned to a higher regime starting Period 20 (sustained large weekly sales P20\u2013P28). On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (pipeline present but delayed history shows variable lead times and at least one lost order earlier). Lead-time observations (from concluded messages) = [2,2,1,2,3] -> average=2, so use calculate for L to reflect observed average. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 20\u201328) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; same recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to cover the sustained post-change demand while using observed average lead time to avoid over-ordering against possible delayed/lost shipments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand regime remains the high regime that began at Period 20 (recent 10-week mean \u2248175 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=524 (covers several upcoming weeks but includes recent orders; overdue/lost orders noted historically). Lead times have varied (observed concluded lead_times include 1,2,2,2,3) so use the empirical average from observed concludes to let the backend infer typical L. For demand forecast use the recent 10-week regime (Periods 20\u201329) where mean=175; set mu_hat via recent_N (N=10) so the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting high current demand (profit and stockouts cost equal) while letting the OR cap limit excessive ordering given in-transit pipeline and observed lead-time variability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=525. Historical concludes show lead times variable (observed 1,2,3) and a recent sustained high-demand regime starting Period 20 (P20\u2013P30 demand avg \u2248142.4 over last 11 periods). A shipment placed in P23 arrived in P26 (lead_time=3) and several earlier orders were delayed/lost. To protect service while accounting for longer actual lead time, I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime (N=11) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices increase coverage for the longer observed lead time and align safety stock to the elevated demand, balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order on Period 23 arrived on Period 26); Demand regime shift starting Period 20: recent avg (P20\u2013P30) \u2248142.4 units/week (sustained high demand).

Promised L=2 understates observed lead time; set L explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the high-demand regime: (1+L)=4 review+lead multiplier on recent weekly mean (~142.4) -> mu_hat \u2248 569.6 to ensure pipeline covers next 4 weeks. Volatility elevated; set sigma_hat explicitly to 120 to reflect observed variability and avoid under-ordering given longer lead time. These parameters prioritize service (profit and sales) given high recent demand and overdue/lost-order risk while recognizing holding cost parity by using a moderate sigma.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Current on-hand=113, in-transit=524. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (recent observed W = 3,2,1) \u2014 averaging short-term gives \u22482. Demand has stayed in a sustained high regime since Period 20 (periods 20\u201332 mean \u2248144.5 units/week). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding, so q=0.5 \u2192 moderate z), I set L to the recent average of observed lead times to capture the recent variability. For demand I use a recent_N window covering the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201332, N=13) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher mean; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to capture current volatility. This protects against underordering given recent high demand while avoiding overly large safety stock beyond the recent regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=88, in-transit=524. Historical concludes show mixed lead times (observed = [2,2,1,2,3,2,1], avg \u22481.86) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 20 with elevated demand since then. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures occasional 3-period delay while not trusting promised=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (regime from Period 20\u201333 length=14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime rather than older low-demand weeks. These choices aim to raise the base stock to cover the longer observed lead-time risk and higher recent mean while sigma from the same window informs safety stock to balance service vs. holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show lead time has recently been 3 periods (order on P23 arrived P26); use explicit L=3 to reflect observed supplier behavior and protect against under-ordering. Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime observed from Period 20\u201330 (avg \u2248142.4 units/week). To capture that regime for the (1+L) review+lead forecast, I use recent_N on the demand regime (N=11, Periods 20\u201330) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand samples. This balances service level (higher \u03bc\u0302 for the high-demand regime and longer observed lead time) while current large pipeline limits immediate ordering urgency.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=73, in-transit=524. History shows confirmed lead time = 3 periods (order P23 arrived P26) and prior lost/delayed shipments; demand regime shifted to sustained high demand starting Period 20 (Periods 20\u201335 show consistently large weekly demand). To capture the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime to avoid dilution by the low-demand earlier regime; N chosen equals the regime length (16 periods: P20\u2013P35). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock calculation on the current high-demand mean and volatility, helping the OR backend size orders to meet high service needs while the explicit larger L accounts for slower arrivals and reduces stockouts.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 20 ( documented P20\u2013P30 avg \u2248142.4); recent history includes mixed arrivals but confirmed lead time=3 (Period 23 order arrived Period 26). Current inventory: on-hand=67, in-transit=524 (total pipeline=591) which covers several weeks at high-demand rates but some prior shipments were delayed/lost. To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and focus forecasting on the sustained high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent regime (Periods 20\u201336 \u224817 periods) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand. Use recent_N (N=17) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend increase target stock for the longer actual lead time and elevated demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=66, in-transit=524. Historical concluded lead times show variability including a confirmed 3-period lead time (P23\u2192P26) but also several 2- and 1-period observations. Recent demand has dropped from the summer spike; Periods 32\u201337 demands = [25,25,10,5,6,1] indicating a sustained low-demand regime starting ~Period 32. To hedge against the observed lead-time variability while letting the OR engine estimate a stable L, I choose 'calculate' (average of observed concluded lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 32\u201337) so mu_hat reflects the new low-demand regime across the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce forecasted demand and variation so the backend lowers target base-stock and orders, avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

On-hand=64, in-transit=524 supports coverage but some earlier orders were lost; to reflect observed lead time I set L explicitly=3.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained collapse in demand starting Period 32: demands P32\u2013P39 = [25,25,10,5,6,1,2,0] (avg=9.25), down sharply from the prior sustained high regime P20\u2013P30 (avg\u2248142.4). Pipeline = 524, on-hand = 64. Lead-time evidence: confirmed LT=3 (order P23\u2192arrived P26). Because demand has clearly shifted down and persisted for 8 periods, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (reflecting observed arrivals) and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts across the review+lead horizon using the most recent low-demand regime. This prevents over-ordering given large in-transit stock while still accounting for the longer observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg decreased from 142.4 (P20\u2013P30) to 9.25 (P32\u2013P39) \u2014 sustained low demand across 8 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 32 (recent weekly demands P32\u2013P40 = [25,25,10,5,6,1,2,0,13], avg \u22489.7). On-hand=51, in-transit=524 (pipeline large). Lead time evidence: orders show actual LT=3 observed (order P23\u2192arrived P26); use explicit LT=3 to avoid under-ordering given confirmed 3-period arrivals. To match the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (the regime length) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This keeps target base-stock low to limit holding cost while covering the 4-period demand window (review+lead). No new carry-over patterns beyond previously recorded shifts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=524 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times show mixed 1\u20133 periods (observed sample avg \u22481.86). Demand experienced a sustained low regime from Periods 32\u201339 (avg \u22489.25) with two higher observations in P40\u2013P41 (13,61) \u2014 not yet a sustained reversal. To be conservative and avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost, I set L via observed average ('calculate') so backend learns actual mean lead time. For demand I anchor to the recent sustained low regime (Periods 32\u201339) using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets low base-stock and avoids overstocking the large in-transit volume. This balances service vs holding cost given high pipeline and uncertain uptick in P40\u2013P41.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical conclude messages confirm at least one persistent lead-time=3 observation (order on P23 arrived P26) and earlier evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Because actual lead time has been observed as 3 and shipments have been delayed/lost, I set L explicitly to 3 to avoid under-ordering. Demand has been volatile with a recent large spike (P42=379) but also low weeks (P32\u2013P39 avg\u22489); to balance responsiveness to recent surges while smoothing noise I use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.5. I leave sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend can compute service-level safety stock from long-run variability. These choices aim to (1) avoid stockouts from underestimated lead time, (2) moderately increase forecast weight on recent high demand, and (3) retain conservative volatility for safety stock given uncertain shipment reliability.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=827 (large pipeline including recent orders). Historical concluded lead times: observed samples = [2,2,1,2,3,2,1] (orders on P2,P6,P7,P12,P23,P30,P31) \u2192 mixed but average ~1.86. Several past shipments overdue/lost (notably P1) so I avoid trusting single promised lead_time. I set L to be calculated from concluded lead-time history so backend uses the empirical average. Demand is volatile with a recent spike (periods 39\u201343 = [0,13,61,379,3]); to capture the current regime I use a recent_N forecast with N=5 for mu_hat and matching recent_N for sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the latest demand pattern. This balances service (respond to recent high demand) while backend cap will limit excessive same-period ordering given large in-transit pipeline.

Demand has been volatile with recent spikes (P42=379) but no sustained new regime since Period 40. Given the confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit stock, set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed supplier behavior so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples (scaled by 1+L) \u2014 this avoids overreacting to the recent isolated spike while the large in-transit position already covers near-term demand and reduces unnecessary new orders/holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=290, in-transit=524. Recent demand has returned to a low regime after mid-year spikes; last 5 concluded demands: [379,3,11,8,5] (one large outlier at P42). Lead time history shows mixed observations (mostly 2, occasional 1 and 3). To balance service vs holding with a noisy recent spike, I estimate lead time from observed history (calculate) and use an EWMA for demand (gamma=0.3) to downweight the single large outlier while still responding to recent low demand. Sigma left as default to reflect long-run variability scaled by (1+L). This keeps target base-stock moderate given current high on-hand + in-transit and high holding cost.
