Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent demand samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013Feb) show rising weekly demand (72,81,87,104,149). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance across history; this balances service (capture upward trend via sample mean) versus holding cost without overcommitting given limited evidence of sustained regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows an upward shift: historical weekly series (72,81,87,104,149) plus Period 1 demand=195 indicates a new, higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 from Period 1 order (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 arrival not yet observed, so do not assume lost shipment or changed lead time. Use promised lead time (default L) because there is no concluded arrival proving lead-time change. For demand I choose recent_N with N=3 (most recent weeks: 104,149,195) to capture the higher mean; mu_hat will therefore be (1+L)\xd7mean of these 3 recent observations to size cover for review+lead. Volatility has clearly increased with the spike; use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat so the backend scales safety stock to recent variability. This balances higher service needs (avoid stockouts given rising demand) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to the most recent regime rather than all historical lows.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=374 (149+225). No 'arrived' concludes seen yet so actual lead time not confirmed. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples (2019-01 weekly series) as baseline. Choose L=default to avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples (72,81,87,104,149) show mean ~98.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=445 (sum of prior orders 149+225+71). No concluded arrivals observed -> cannot infer actual lead time; shipments are still in-transit. Use promised lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; current pipeline (445) already covers several review+lead periods, so this conservative choice avoids over-ordering while the arrival pattern resolves.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent weekly demands (5 samples) show rising demand into Feb (mean \u2248 98.6). On-hand=129, in-transit=220 but conclude history shows only Period 2 order (225) arrived with lead_time=2; Period 1 order (149) appears lost/overdue. I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (we have an observed lead_time=2). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast across the review+lead period given limited data and some missing arrivals. This balances service level (protecting against the confirmed 2-period lead time) while avoiding overreaction to one potentially lost shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=44, in-transit=297 (large pipeline). Recent realized weekly demand has fallen from ~195\u2192179\u2192119\u219296\u219285 over the last 5 weeks. One concluded arrival shows an actual lead time of 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4), so no evidence to change promised L. To capture the recent lower-demand regime, I use the most recent 5 demand samples for forecasting (N=5). Keeping L=default (promised 2) lets the OR engine use the contractual lead time while mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N focus replenishment on the new lower mean and observed variability, reducing excess holding given sizeable pipeline and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized demand (Period1-6 concludes) shows weekly demand moving from high (195,179) down toward ~100s (119,96,85,101). Current on-hand 20 + in-transit 356 = 376 units in pipeline \u2014 ample coverage for multiple weeks. Observed lead times: one order (P2\u2192P4) had L=2, one (P5\u2192P6) had L=1; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Given large pipeline and no sustained, multi-period change in demand or lead time, use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine's base-stock logic governs replenishment while respecting holding vs profit tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=386. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 arrival (order on P2) => LT=2; Period6 arrival (order on P5) => LT=1. Mixed evidence so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer L. Demand recent history is noisy with a single large spike (211 in P7) but no sustained regime shift (needs \u22653 periods). Therefore use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend uses all samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (capture variable demand via backend stats) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent realized demand (Periods 4-8) = [96,85,101,211,144], recent mean elevated by a large spike in Period 7. Current on-hand=22, in-transit=274 (ample pipeline). Observed realized lead times in conclude messages: 2 (P4 for order P2), 1 (P6 for order P5), 2 (P8 for order P6), 1 (P8 for order P7) \u2014 variability between 1\u20132 periods. To balance service vs holding cost given high pipeline and volatile short-term demand, I use a recent-window estimate for lead time (captures current 1\u20132 variability) and recent demand for mu and sigma to react to the recent spike while avoiding overcommitment given large in-transit inventory. Methods chosen: L via recent_N (N=4) to reflect the last 4 observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) uses the last 5 demand observations (Periods 4\u20138) to capture the recent spike; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) uses the same 5-period window for volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent demand but constrained by existing pipeline (OR backend will cap orders).

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time variability between 1 and 2 periods; recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1], average 1.5 (Periods: P4,P6,P8,P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has been variable with a spike (P7=211) then moderate weeks (P8=144, P9=113). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 which likely covers upcoming demand but some past orders showed lead-time variability. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5), so I set L to the calculated average to reflect actual variability. To capture the recent demand regime (last 5 periods showing elevated mean and volatility), I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock and cap reflect current higher demand and volatility while limiting excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized demands (Periods 6-10 = 101,211,144,113,88) show a mixed but not permanently higher regime; on-hand=128, in-transit=249 \u2192 pipeline=377, so we currently have ample coverage. Recent observed lead times show variability (recent: [2,1,2,1], avg 1.5). I choose L as recent_N to reflect that recent variability (N=4). For demand I use recent_N over the last 5 demand points to capture the most recent demand regime (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most relevant window. This avoids overreacting to older samples while acknowledging pipeline sufficiency and variable lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence [2,1,2,1], avg 1.5) and no new confirmed longer delays. On-hand=39, in-transit=338 (pipeline adequate vs. near-term demand). Demand spiked in Period 7 (211) then settled lower (Periods 8-11: 144,113,88,89). I treat lead time as recent average to capture variability (recent_N N=4). For demand I focus on the most recent stable regime (Periods 8-11) using recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period coverage based on the latest lower demand level and reduced volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Historical concluded lead times show alternation 2 and 1 (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5), so I set L to a recent-average to capture that variability. Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 144,113,88,89,132) better reflects current regime than older Jan samples, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest pattern. This balances service (capturing recent higher spikes like 144 and 132) against holding cost by avoiding overly long-horizon means from older data.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=288. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2] (avg \u22481.57) showing persistent 1\u20132 period variability around promised L=2. Recent demand (Periods 9\u201313): 113,88,89,132,130 \u2014 elevated vs. early-sample; I treat the last 5 periods as the current demand regime. Choices: L set to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times (captures the ~1.57 realized lead time); mu_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent demand regime and reflect the recent higher mean; sigma_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting near-term demand spikes while the lead-time estimate reduces over-ordering when actual lead time shorter than promised.

Recent demand has been elevated vs. early-sample baseline: last 5 concluded demands = [88,89,132,130,106], mean=109. To balance high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) and the observed LT variability, estimate lead time using recent observed L (captures 1\u20132 fluctuation) and forecast demand using the last 5 periods to reflect current regime. Volatility also based on last 5 periods to capture recent demand swings. These choices increase target base-stock to preserve service given in-transit uncertainty while not overcommitting to very long L.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Recent concluded lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2); pipeline is large but uncertain due to variable LT. Demand recent periods higher (~130,106,110,130/132) so I use recent data to reflect current elevated regime. Choose L=recent_N (N=4) to capture recent average lead time (1/2 variability). Use mu_hat=recent_N (N=4) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=4) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility, improving responsiveness to the recent high-demand regime while the capped order cap prevents excessive single-period orders given holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=379. Recent demand has stabilized near ~100-130/wk (last 5 demands: 132,130,106,110,100; mean ~115.6). Lead times have shown variability (observed 1 and 2 periods recently). I choose to let the system estimate L from observed lead times (method=calculate) to capture that variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (stable ~115/wk) so (1+L)*mean reflects current demand. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These settings reduce risk of overreacting to older low-Jan samples and adapt to the recent steady ~100\u2013130 demand while allowing the backend to internalize observed lead-time variability; the in-transit stock (379) already provides cushion against short lead-time realizations.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10. On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead times show variability; last 4 observed lead times average 1.5 periods. Demand has softened vs initial ramp; last 5 observed demands = [130,106,110,100,79], mean=105. I set L using recent_N=4 to reflect short-term observed lead-time mean (captures mixed 1\u20132 periods). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (last 5 weeks mean ~105) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std appropriately. This balances service (respecting observed shorter lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory, reducing propensity to order aggressively.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrivals have been intermittent (observed lead times show 1\u20132 periods). Recent demand has fallen vs earlier weeks: last 5 realized demands = [106,110,100,79,52], average ~89.4. I choose L='calculate' to let the backend use the empirical average of observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the recent lower-demand regime over the past 5 periods. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so safety stock matches current demand volatility. These settings reduce over-ordering given the large in-transit quantity and lower recent demand while still accounting for lead-time variability.

Historical lead times show variability (observed recent lead times = [2,1,2,1], avg 1.5) so use recent lead-time estimate to reflect faster arrivals sometimes seen. Demand has fallen in recent periods (Periods 14\u201319 demands = 106,110,100,79,52,56 \u2192 sustained lower regime), so forecast and volatility should be based on the most recent 6 samples to capture this downshift and avoid overstock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/07/01. Recent observed lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2; recent sequence length=4), so I use recent_N for L to reflect shorter-than-promised average. Demand has dropped since spring; last 6 periods show a clear downward regime (demands: P15- P20 = 110,100,79,52,56,29), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to capture the new lower mean and reduced volatility. On-hand=0 and in-transit=363 \u2014 with L averaged from recent lead times the pipeline likely covers (1+L) periods, so using recent-window forecasts limits overordering while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. Recent arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2); pipeline=363, on-hand=0. Demand has fallen materially since spring. I set L to recent_N with N=4 to reflect observed recent lead-time average (1.5) rather than blind promised=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 16-21) to capture the new lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and holding risk while preserving service for near-term demand given in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 7-12 avg demand \u2248129 units; Periods 16-21 avg demand =58 units (\u221255%), sustained decline starting ~Period 13.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand shows a sustained decline since ~Period 13 (low-regime: Periods 16-22 avg \u224858). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have alternated 1 and 2; recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime I use recent samples for demand (capture the low mean/volatility), and for lead time I use the recent observed Ls (to hedge between 1 and 2). Choices: L -> recent_N N=4 to capture the most recent alternating 1/2 pattern; mu_hat -> recent_N N=7 to base forecast on the 7 most recent low-regime demand weeks; sigma_hat -> recent_N N=7 to estimate volatility from the same low-regime window. These settings reduce target base-stock relative to earlier high-demand regime while acknowledging in-transit stock; they help the OR backend avoid over-ordering given the sustained drop in demand and observed lead-time variability.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since ~Period 13 (recent weekly demands ~29,32,39,37) and observed lead times alternating between 1 and 2 (average ~1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (large pipeline). To reflect the shorter recent demand level I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 4 weeks: Periods 20-23). For lead time I use recent_N on the last 4 observed lead times to capture the 1\u20132 variability. These choices reduce forecasted (review+lead) demand to match the sustained decline while retaining volatility from the last 4 samples; with high pipeline I avoid large new orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=363 units (large pipeline possibly from earlier orders; some variability in arrivals historically). Recent concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) \u2192 use recent_N to reflect shorter/variable actual lead time. Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (recent weeks Periods 18\u201324 demands = [52,56,29,32,39,37,30], avg \u224837). To avoid overstocking given holding cost $1 vs profit $4, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand window (N=7) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime while the pipeline is large. These choices bias orders toward servicing near-term lower demand and avoid inflating base-stock from older high-demand samples, while L recent_N captures true lead-time variability for safety.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline beginning ~Period 13 with current weekly demand ~30\u201340 units; observed lead times from concluded arrivals alternate 1 and 2 (avg 1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 \u2014 ample pipeline stock vs. recent demand. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201325 mean \u224833.4) and scale by (1+L) inside the backend. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders conservative given low demand and large in-transit inventory, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (sustained decline vs early periods). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 363 (pipeline large). Observed lead times recently vary around 1\u20132 (recent sequence [2,1,2,1], avg 1.5). To reflect the shorter observed lead-time while still using recent evidence, set L based on recent 4 observed lead times. For demand I use the recent low-demand regime (post-changepoint ~Period 13) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 14 demand samples to capture the sustained lower mean/variance. These choices bias the OR backend toward lower target inventory (reducing holding cost) while respecting the observed lead-time variability and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (carry-over shows sustained decline). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (large pipeline but arrivals delayed historically). Recent concluded lead-time observations alternate 1 and 2; I use recent_N to capture current variability. I set L using recent 4 observed lead times to reflect the ~1.5-period average and variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint lower-demand regime (Periods 23-27: 37,30,29,74,75) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)-scaled recent mean rather than the high historical pre-changepoint mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the newer, lower-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time uncertainty and the existing large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning ~Period 13 (weekly demands mostly well below early-period peaks). Observed concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (sufficient pipeline cover short-term). To respect the confirmed slower demand regime, set L by calculate to capture observed avg lead time across concluded arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent sustained low-demand regime (last 13 observed weekly demands from Periods 16\u201328) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to the lowered demand and tighter recent volatility, reducing excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = [2,1,2,1,2,1], mean 1.5) and a sustained lower-demand regime since ~Period 13. I choose to let backend compute lead time from observed history (calculate) so it captures the 1\u20132 period variability. For demand I bias to the most recent regime to avoid overstating demand from early high weeks: use recent_N on the last 6 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean; same recent_N=6 for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect current variability. These parameters prioritize matching supply to the recent lower-but-variable demand, limiting excess holding costs while maintaining service given in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has declined and stabilized at a lower level since ~Period 13; I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) to reflect the current regime and reduce overstating forecast. Sigma set to recent_N over same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices aim to size base-stock for the shortened, lower-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded lead times show alternating 2 and 1 periods (observed sequence avg=1.5). Demand experienced a sustained downshift beginning ~Period 13 (carry-over noted). To avoid overstock given current low-demand regime, set L to use calculated average lead time from observations (lets backend use observed avg\u22481.5). For demand forecast, use recent_N to focus on the post-changepoint low-demand regime (capture recent 10 weeks of demand to smooth variability while emphasizing the lower level). Use same recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to earlier high-demand periods, lowering holding cost exposure while preserving service against the current observed demand pattern and variable lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded lead times show variability with recent observed lead times [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (carry-over insight). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to recent average to reflect shorter/variable actual LT; set demand forecast and volatility using recent samples to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent variability. In-transit 363 units likely covers multiple periods; using recent-based mu/sigma prevents overforecasting from old high-demand weeks and reduces holding exposure.

No new sustained lead-time evidence since prior insight. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes L=2. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (~72.5) and reduce overstock risk given large in-transit. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward current observed lower demand while allowing the backend cap to limit excessive ordering given the large pipeline and holding cost tradeoff (profit $4, holding $1).

Lead-time: use recent_N=4 (last observed lead times [2,1,2,1], avg=1.5) to reflect faster-than-promised variability. Demand: a sustained downshift began ~Period 13 (documented), so forecast using recent demand regime \u2014 use recent_N=20 to compute mu_hat across the most recent 20 demand samples (multiplied by 1+L by backend) to avoid overstock. Volatility: use recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to capture current regime variability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) and a sustained demand decline since ~Period 13. I choose L='calculate' to use the average of all observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (last 13 demand periods, Periods 23\u201335) to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg \u224864 units/week) so the base-stock aligns to recent demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago high variability. These choices help the OR backend set a conservative base-stock that matches the sustained lower-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit volume.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (weekly demands mostly 30\u2013101, recent average lower than early high spikes). On-hand=0, in-transit=363 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks. Observed lead times have varied between 1\u20132 periods historically. To reflect sustained lower-demand regime while retaining protection from lead-time variability: set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times ~1.5), use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to base forecast on the most recent lower-demand regime, and use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. This reduces overordering for the now-lower demand while keeping safety for lead-time uncertainty and the large in-transit balance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1 and 2 periods (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). Demand regime declined starting ~Period 13; recent periods (P18\u2013P37) show lower, more stable demand compared with early high spikes. To account for observed lead-time variability I set L to the calculated average from concluded arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N (N=20) window to capture the post-changepoint regime (cap 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower-demand behavior; this reduces over-ordering vs. using all-sample means while the large in-transit pipeline (363) provides near-term cover for demand and mitigates risk from occasional 1-period arrivals.

Historical concluded lead times show alternation of 1 and 2 with average \u22481.5; use calculated lead time so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has shown a sustained decline since ~Period 13 (noting prior insight), so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std robustly.

Promised lead time=2 but past concluded arrivals show variability (1\u20132); use backend 'calculate' to let observed lead times drive L. Demand has been in a lower, sustained regime for many periods; use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent 20 periods and avoid being pulled by early high samples. This balances service (capture recent demand level) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=363 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times (observed sequence includes 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg ~1.5) and a sustained demand decline since ~Period 13 (lower recent weekly demand vs early periods). To avoid overreacting to older high-demand weeks, I anchor demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 variability). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are driven by the recent lower-demand regime (reduces overstating base stock given large in-transit). This balances service level (protect vs short lead-time arrivals) against holding cost (avoid building inventory on top of 363 in-transit).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed recent lead times = [2,1,2,1], avg=1.5) but no new concluded arrivals since earlier periods, so I will explicitly rely on recent observed lead-time behavior. Demand has exhibited a sustained lower regime since ~Period 13 (user-provided insight); recent weeks show consistently ~50\u201390 units. To keep the OR engine responsive to the lower recent demand regime while accounting for lead-time variability, I set L using the recent observed lead times (short window) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand samples to reflect the sustained decline. This balances service (covering review+lead demand with modest safety) versus holding cost by using recent-demand statistics rather than older higher-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Promised L=2 but concluded history shows variable lead times (recent observed = [2,1,2,1]). To account for this variability I set L using recent observed lead times (N=4). Demand dropped after Period 13 and recent weeks show moderate, variable weekly demand (last ~8 weeks range ~63\u2013114); to reflect the recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 so the OR backend bases base-stock on the latest demand regime. This balances service (capture recent demand uptick) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock already covers multiple weeks.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1], avg=1.5) so I let backend compute average lead time from observed data (calculate). Demand experienced a sustained decline starting ~Period 13 (Period 7-12 avg \u2248129 \u2192 Periods 16-21 avg \u224858); to reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use the last 20 demand samples for demand mean and volatility (recent_N, N=20).

Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 13 (carry-over insight). To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) periods of demand, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures 1.5). I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-changepoint lower-demand regime and recent volatility (12-week window balances responsiveness and stability). These choices bias orders toward current lower demand while still covering lead-time risk given in-transit stock.

Observed lead times have varied between 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.5). To respect observed variability while letting backend estimate mean lead time from concluded arrivals, set L via calculate. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the most recent stable low-demand regime (Periods ~26\u201345 fall in this regime) and to limit influence of earlier high-demand spikes.
