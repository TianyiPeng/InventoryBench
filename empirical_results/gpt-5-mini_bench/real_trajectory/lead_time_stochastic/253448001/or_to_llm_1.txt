We only observe arrivals up through Period 45 (120 units arrived from P42 order). Current visible on-hand=55; in-transit=697 but pipeline has prior evidence of unreliability (some earlier multi-period orders never concluded). Demand outlook: recent weeks (P41\u2013P45) show strong sales (41, 58, 20, 45, 65) with a spike to 65 in P45; calendar: today is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) which can increase short-term demand. OR recommends 0 using promised L and historical averages. Decision trade-offs: ordering now risks adding holding cost ($1/unit/period) if many in-transit arrive or if demand falls after holiday; not ordering risks stockouts if in-transit is lost and demand stays high. Given substantial in-transit quantity (697) likely to cover near-term demand even if some shipments are lost, and high uncertainty / variable lead times, I avoid adding more inventory now. Action: follow OR and order 0 to avoid excess holding cost while monitoring conclude messages for arrivals (if many in-transit fail to conclude in coming periods, escalate orders).",

Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=697 units (large pipeline) which should cover multiple future weeks even if some shipments are delayed or partially lost. Demand & seasonality: recent weekly demand has been ~55\u201371 (P40\u2013P46 range), so 697 in-transit >> (L+1)-period demand. OR recommended 0; OR uses promised L and historical demand but cannot see lost shipments \u2014 I account for that by erring on the side of not over-ordering given high pipeline and non-trivial holding cost ($1/unit/period).
