{
  "rationale": "On-hand = 0, in-transit = 11,742. OR recommends 0. Historical demand mean ~689/week, L=2 implies (1+L) demand \u22482,067 and base-stock \u22482,272 (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 with z*=\u03a6\u22121(0.95)=1.645). Pipeline (11,742) far exceeds base-stock and covers many future periods; placing new order risks large holding cost. Carry-over history shows variable lead times and some lost shipments, but recent concludes have delivered significant quantities and current pipeline is very large and likely contains usable inventory. With profit $19 >> holding $1, the OR fractile is high and OR recommends no order; I will follow OR and place 0 to avoid overstock/holding cost.",
