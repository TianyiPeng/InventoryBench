{
  "rationale": "History shows variable actual lead times (1\u20132 periods) and prior lost/delayed shipments; current on-hand=0 but in-transit=944 units (some may be delayed). Recent demand after the Nov spike averaged ~110/week (Periods 43\u201346: 94,121,126,98) and OR (which assumes promised L=2) recommends 0. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile=0.5 \u2192 no aggressive overstocking. With L+1=3 periods to cover, 944 in-transit already covers ~8\u20139 weeks at recent demand (~110), so ordering now risks extra holding cost and is unnecessary given uncertain arrivals.
