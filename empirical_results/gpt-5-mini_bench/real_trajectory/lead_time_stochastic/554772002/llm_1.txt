  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, low seasonal demand for everyday women's tees). Demand analysis: recent 8-week demand (Periods 39-46) = [7,13,20,33,8,10,14,14], sum=119, avg=14.9 units/week \u2014 far below earlier summer averages (~70+/week in Periods 22-33). Lead-time / pipeline: historical concludes show supplier unreliable and many overdue in-transit shipments; treat in-transit as unreliable. Inventory assessment: on-hand=78 units; promised lead_time=2 so planning horizon = L+1 = 3 periods -> expected demand \u2248 3 * 15 \u2248 45 units. On-hand (78) already covers this with cushion. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit) favors avoiding excess inventory while pipeline is unreliable. Action logic: place no new order this period to avoid holding cost and because on-hand covers near-term demand and pipeline is unreliable.",
