{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 2 (from history). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 450. Demand outlook: recent sustained regime (Period 33\u201346) average demand \u2248104.6 units/week. Coverage requirement = (L+1)=3 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248 3 \xd7 104.6 \u2248 315 units. Decision: do not order now because pipeline (450) already exceeds the 3-period demand coverage (450 > 315) and placing more would incur unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit is $4. OR recommended 0; I follow it to avoid overstock given ample pipeline and sustained high demand.",
