OR baseline: recommended 113 units using its capped base-stock (it uses promised L=2 and all samples). Cost incentives: profit $19 vs holding $1 gives a high critical fractile (~0.95) so OR's high service level is appropriate. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 113 units. Rationale: with zero inventory and high profit-to-holding ratio, the risk of stockouts (lost sales) outweighs the modest holding cost; the recent spike is suggestive but not sustained, so no upward adjustment beyond OR is warranted.

Given prior periods' confirmed overdue/lost shipment (P1 113 units flagged) the effective available pipeline is likely lower; treating the 113 as at-risk reduces pipeline to ~263 and yields order_raw \u2248 228, which the cap limits to \u2248188. I increase the order above the OR recommendation (65) to the cap (188) to restore a full base-stock covering the (L+1)-period demand plus safety stock while recognizing one overdue shipment. This balances high profit vs low holding cost and protects against stockouts given recent high demand spikes (notably 168,171,148) and variable lead times.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows multiple delayed/lost shipments earlier (Periods 1,2,17) but more recent concludes (P23, P32, P45) show the supplier can deliver at 1\u20132 period lead times. Current visible pipeline = 470 and on-hand = 35 (total 505). Demand context: recent weekly demand in Dec is low (30\u201340/week) and long-run sample mean from early history ~65/week; even allowing for variance, pipeline covers many weeks of demand. OR recommends 0 using promised L and historical demand; given the very large pipeline and current low seasonal demand, placing new orders risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) that would erode profit ($19/unit). Action: place 0 to avoid increasing holding costs while existing pipeline exhausts and to observe actual arrival patterns before committing more. Monitor for any further signs of lost shipments; if concluded arrivals show a large portion of the 470 is lost, revise upward next period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Follow OR (order 0): on-hand+in-transit = 505 units far exceeds expected near-term demand (Dec ~30\u201340/week), so avoid extra holding cost and wait to confirm actual arrivals.",
