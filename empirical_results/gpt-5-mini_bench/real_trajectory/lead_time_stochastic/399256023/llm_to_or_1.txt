Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time not verifiable\u2014use promised lead time. Recent week (2019-02-04) shows a single spike but it is not a sustained 3+ period shift, so do not treat as a regime change. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples; this balances service level given limited evidence while avoiding overreaction to a single high observation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~65 units/week; last period we placed an order of 113 which has not concluded yet (arrived=0) and shows as 113 in-transit. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time, and there is no sustained changepoint in demand (only one high sample 113). To avoid overfitting, use promised lead time and population statistics: set L=default so backend uses promised L=2, mu_hat=default to base forecast on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean), and sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility. This balances service level (profitable unit margin $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding premature increases in safety stock given limited evidence of a regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed weekly demand is elevated: Period1=148, Period2=171, plus prior sample 2019-02-04=113 \u2014 indicates a recent upward demand regime but only 2 concluded weeks of very high demand so far. Two prior orders (P1,P2) have not concluded (arrived=0) but this is insufficient (fewer than 3 periods) to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. To be conservative, keep L as promised (default). To capture the recent uptick in demand while remaining robust, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples (N=3) so the OR engine inflates target inventory toward the new regime without overreacting to a single week. This raises service level to avoid stockouts given the large in-transit position and recent high demand, while sigma_hat recent_N=3 captures recent volatility to temper over-ordering against holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly demand samples show low-to-moderate demand (samples: 36,54,62,60,113). On-hand=0, in-transit=455 (sum of orders placed in P1-P3). All three prior orders (P1-P3) have not yet concluded arrivals; this suggests delayed but not confirmed lost shipments. Promised lead time is 2; there is insufficient concluded-arrival evidence to override the promise, so use L=default. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical sample set while the pipeline (455) currently provides coverage. This balances service level vs holding cost given uncertainty about actual lead time and the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded arrivals after promised lead time; total in-transit=455 units (ordered: P1=113, P2=149, P3=193) \u2014 possible sustained shipment delay.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=45, in-transit=306 (orders P1=113, P2=149, P3=193 historically). History shows P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4), P1 and P3 remain unconfirmed past their promised arrivals \u2014 possible lost/delayed shipments but only one observed lead time=2. To remain conservative and let backend use promised dynamics with confirmed evidence, set L by calculating average observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2). Demand samples (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb 2019) are sparse but show mean=65; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against holding cost while the in-transit uncertainty is resolved.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (orders from P1,P3,P5). History shows one concluded arrival: P2 order arrived in P4 => observed lead_time=2. Some earlier orders remained delayed but we now have direct evidence lead_time=2. Set L by calculate to use observed lead times (captures confirmed 2-period lead). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from all samples (conservative given limited data and recent variability). This balances service level (using confirmed lead time) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in Period 4; ordered on Period 2, lead_time=2)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand (P1-P6) has been elevated and volatile vs older 2019 samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=337 (multiple outstanding orders). Lead time evidence is mixed (observed lead_times: 2 in P4, 1 in P6) so use observed-average for L. Use recent demand (last 6 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated regime and recent volatility. These choices balance service (cover near-term higher demand) while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=471 (contains outstanding orders from P1,P2,P3,P5,P7). Observed concluded lead times: P2->P4 (LT=2), P5->P6 (LT=1) -> recent average LT ~1.5, so I use recent_N for L with N=2 to reflect current variability. Demand has shifted upward recently (recent demands: P4=104, P5=72, P6=119, P7=168) with a notable jump in P7; I use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat to focus forecast on the latest regime. Volatility likely increased with the demand jump, so use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to capture recent variance. These choices balance service (capture recent higher demand and variable lead time) against holding cost by restricting forecasts to recent data rather than older lower-demand samples. I note multiple overdue/unconcluded early orders (P1,P3) when reconciling pipeline; parameter choices assume in-transit is valid but signal possible lost shipments, so I avoid up-weighting very old demand data.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders from Period 1 (113 units) and Period 3 (193 units) have not concluded after promised lead time and remain outstanding in-transit \u2014 possible lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=23, in-transit=306 with known outstanding early orders (possible lost shipments from P1 and P3). Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)] \u2014 recent variability around 1\u20132 periods. I set L via recent_N (N=4) to capture the observed average lead time (1.5) rather than blindly trusting promised L=2 or a single older observation. Demand has been elevated in recent weeks (Periods 4\u20138 = 104,72,119,168,142); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent regime behavior (covers the most recent 5 demand samples) so the backend's base-stock reflects current higher demand while limiting overreaction to older low samples. This approach increases target stock to protect service given in-transit uncertainty and variable lead times, while sigma_hat recent estimation balances safety-stock sizing against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variable and alternating between 1 and 2 periods (observed lead_times: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1); average ~1.5 over last 4 observed arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical arrivals show variable lead times alternating 1 and 2 periods (recent observed lead_times over last 4 arrivals avg\u22481.5) and several overdue/missing early shipments. Recent demand (Periods 4-9 = [104,72,119,168,142,91]) is clearly higher than the sparse Jan-Feb samples, so use a recent-demand estimate. Set L based on recent observed lead times (recent_N) to capture the ~1.5 average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (recent_N=6) to reflect the elevated regime and recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances higher target service (due to lost/delayed shipments risk) against holding cost by relying on recent higher mean and observed variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=70, in-transit=309; prior concludes show several long-outstanding orders (P1=113, P3=193) still in-transit \u2192 possible lost shipments. Observed arrival lead_times (by conclude): P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1, P9->P10=1 (last 5 arrivals average ~1.4). Demand recent pattern (Periods 6-10): [119,168,142,91,69] suggests current demand regime different from earlier samples. To reflect variable/shorter realized lead time and recent demand, I set L using recent observed lead times (recent_N=5) and set demand and volatility using the most recent 5 demand periods (recent_N=5). This directs the OR backend to size base-stock around the recent demand level while capturing observed lead-time variability; retaining awareness of outstanding in-transit units (possible lost P1/P3) via conservative recent-based estimates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: last 5 observed arrivals lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1], average ~1.4 (Periods: P2->P4, P5->P6, P6->P8, P7->P8, P9->P10); possible lost shipments still outstanding (P1=113, P3=193 remain in-transit).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=396 with outstanding early orders; recent demand has softened (last 5 period demands = 168,142,91,69,72 \u2192 mean ~108). Observed lead times have been variable over recent arrivals (last 5 observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1], avg ~1.4). To reflect recent lead-time variability and the most recent demand regime, I set L to recent_N (N=5) to let the backend average recent observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the last 5 demand periods. This balances service (capturing shorter recent lead-times) against holding cost given softened demand and outstanding in-transit stock.

On-hand=44, in-transit=365 (includes long-outstanding orders P1=113 and P3=193). Observed lead times recent arrivals = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg ~1.4). To account for variable lead time but preserve backend expectation, set L via recent_N on last 5 observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 5 demand periods to capture the lower recent demand regime and reduce excess ordering.

Recent observed lead times vary but average >1 (sequence of observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2]). To account for observed lead-time variability and overdue shipments I set L to the empirical average of observed arrivals so the backend inflates pipeline coverage appropriately. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full demand history, balancing service level (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has averaged ~58 units/week over the last 5 concluded periods (P11\u2013P15) with moderate variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=347 (outstanding older shipments may include lost/delayed units). Lead time has been variable but recent confirmed arrivals show lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg ~1.4). To balance service and holding cost I set L based on the most recent 5 observed lead times (captures current variability). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (reflects the current lower-demand regime) so the backend computes base_stock and cap using a (1+L)-horizon forecast that accounts for observed lead-time variability and recent demand level.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=347 (outstanding older orders incl. P1=113 and P3=193 per history). Observed lead times in recent arrivals show variability (last 5 observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1], avg ~1.4); to capture this I set L via recent_N=5 to weight recent lead-time mix. Demand has shifted upward in the most recent 5 periods (demands: 60,43,45,70,115) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime and volatility. These settings help the backend compute a base-stock that balances higher short-run demand and variable lead time while limiting excess holding cost from older outstanding in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=309 with some historical missing shipments. Recent arrival history shows variable lead times but a recent run of multi-period 2-day arrivals. Demand has risen recently (last 5 weekly demands: 43,45,70,115,148). To balance service vs holding cost I estimate lead time from the most recent observed arrivals and focus demand estimates on the last 5 weeks. Therefore: L by recent_N over last 4 observed lead times to capture the recent shift toward longer leads; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent higher demand regime. This helps the OR backend size base-stock for (1+L) review+lead coverage while keeping volatility estimates tied to the latest demand variability. I note outstanding in-transit units may include lost shipments but OR backend cannot see that; using recent lead-time average nudges orders upward to cover risk.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time shift toward 2 periods: last 3 observed arrivals have lead_times = [2,2,2] (orders: P11->P13, P12->P14, P15->P17); suggests sustained increase in frequency of 2-period leads.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Recent arrival history shows a sustained shift to 2-period leads (last 3 observed lead_times = [2,2,2]); shipments earlier remain outstanding but recent pattern is stable. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost (profit=19, hold=1 => target service ~\u03a6(z)=19/20=0.95), I set lead time to the recent average (N=3) so (1+L) demand window captures the longer delays. Demand has varied; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the latest demand regime and volatility over the most recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time shift toward 2 periods: last 3 observed arrivals lead_times = [2,2,2] (orders: P11->P13, P12->P14, P15->P17); suggests sustained increase in frequency of 2-period leads.

LLM Rationale:

Recent arrivals show lead-time variability with a recent bias toward 2-period leads but occasional 1-period arrivals; to capture this variability I use a recent average of recent observed lead times. Demand has shifted recently (volatile last 5 periods: 70,115,148,92,81) so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the latest lead-time mix and current higher short-term demand while limiting excess held inventory given low holding cost relative to profit.

LLM Rationale:

Recent arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) with a modest tilt toward 2; demand recent history is volatile with several stockouts and intermittent spikes (recent demands last 5 periods: 82,81,92,148,115). I choose L as recent_N to let the backend average the most recent observed lead-times (capture variability). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures recent higher variance and recent spikes) so the OR backend raises base-stock enough to cover (1+L) periods of demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent arrival history shows a shift toward 2-period lead times: the last three observed arrivals had lead_time=2, so I set L based on the most recent 3 observed lead times. Demand has been elevated and variable in recent weeks (recent demands: P17-P21 = [148,92,81,82,131]); to capture the current regime I use a recent_N demand estimate with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility rather than the full-sample mean which is older and lower. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead_times show variability (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2) with overall average ~1.6; recent arrivals are mixed (no sustained shift of 3+ periods). Demand history limited but no strong regime change detected. To balance service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) I use the empirical average lead time and let the OR engine compute base-stock & cap using full-sample demand stats (no recent-only weighting) so safety stock reflects all observed variability and the pipeline volume already in-transit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=389. Observed arrivals show variable lead times alternating 1 and 2 periods (recent sequence ~2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg \u22481.5). Demand has been elevated in recent weeks (several weeks of 80\u2013145 units). To reflect variable lead time while weighting recent behaviour I set L as recent_N over the last 4 observed lead times (captures the 1/2 alternation). For demand I use a recent_N window of 8 weeks to capture the recent higher-demand regime and reduce influence of earlier low samples. I apply the same recent_N=8 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent demand while letting the OR engine cap orders per its rule; using recent data helps hedge against lost/delayed shipments evident in in-transit volume.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 (some earlier orders likely lost/delayed). Recent arrivals show a sustained shift toward 2-period lead times (last 3 observed arrivals lead_times = [2,2,2]). To account for this recent shift I set L using recent_N (N=3) so the backend uses recent lead-time evidence. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given limited historical demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead-time shift toward 2 periods: last 3 observed arrivals lead_times = [2,2,2] (orders: P11->P13, P12->P14, P15->P17); suggests sustained increase in frequency of 2-period leads.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=421 with several older shipments outstanding; recent arrival pattern shifted toward 2-period lead times. I set L using recent_N=3 to capture the recent shift to mostly-2 period arrivals. Demand has been lower than early spikes; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (using the last 5 observed weekly demands: P21-P25 = [131,145,123,70,88]) to focus the forecast on the current regime and avoid overweighting early high outliers. These choices raise the (1+L)-period demand forecast while reflecting recent variability, which helps the backend compute a base stock that balances service (avoid stockouts given outstanding in-transit and variable lead times) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

To be conservative and let the backend infer a robust lead time from observed arrivals, set L=calculate (average of observed lead times). Demand history is limited and no clear recent demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances high target service level (profit/holding \u2192 q\u22480.95) with caution about missing/delayed shipments by letting backend incorporate the averaged lead time and full-sample demand stats.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=402. Historical concluded lead_times (most recent arrivals): P20->P22=2, P22->P23=1, P23->P26=3 \u2014 recent average = 2.0 suggesting lead-time volatility with a shift upward vs earlier. Demand recently (last ~8 periods) has been roughly 70\u2013131/week with many stockouts; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current demand regime while the lead time is unstable. Therefore: set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture most recent observed lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=8) to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest demand pattern and reduce overstating older high early-2019 spikes. These choices help the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to recent demand and a lead-time estimate that reflects recent arrivals, improving service under variable/lengthening lead times while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=402; history shows variable lead times with recent concluded arrivals indicating a shift toward 2-period leads but some 1- and 3-periods occurred (recent volatility). Demand is steady-high weekly (recent demands: 96,124,120,88,70, etc.). To be responsive to the more recent regime while limiting exposure to lost/delayed shipments, I use a recent_N lead-time estimate (N=3) to capture the latest shift toward 2 periods and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the most recent 3 demand samples to reflect current demand level over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This biases orders to cover the next (L+1) weeks of demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent volatility so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=402 with multiple overdue/long-in-transit shipments historically; observed arrivals show lead-time variability but recent evidence favors 2-period deliveries. Recent demand (Periods 24-29) = [70,88,120,96,124,84], mean \u224897 units/week. With promised L=2 and to cover review+lead (1+L)=3 periods, I target a forecast based on the recent 6-week regime: mu_hat uses recent_N (N=6) so backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248291. Sigma reflects recent volatility, so use recent_N (N=6). Explicitly set L=2 to reflect the sustained shift toward 2-period leads and to avoid under-ordering given outstanding in-transit volume and missed arrivals.

Lead times have been variable recently (1\u20133 periods) with several 3-period arrivals observed (P23->P26, P27->P30) but no clear sustained shift of 3+ consecutive arrivals.

I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent shift toward longer lead times (two recent 3-periods and a 2). Demand has been higher and more variable recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent demand regime and keep pipeline sizing responsive while avoiding overstock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

To keep OR backend stable and leverage its promised-L assumption, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (uses all samples).

Recent arrivals show variable lead-times including 1,3,3 in the last 3 observed arrivals, so I estimate a slightly-longer-than-promised lead time. To keep pipeline cover for (1+L) periods while responding to recent demand, I use recent_N for lead time averaging (N=3) and recent demand estimates over the last 5 periods to adapt to the latest demand regime and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) vs holding cost by relying on short recent windows rather than full-sample averages.

Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained shift to mostly 2-period lead times in recent observations. Demand recent run (Periods 29-34) is stable/low-80s. I set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent confirmed shift toward 2-period leads. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using the last 6 demand periods (Periods 29-34) to reflect the recent lower-demand regime; this balances service (covers review+lead demand) while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost. These choices help the OR backend produce a base-stock that accounts for the recently higher frequency of 2-period leads and the recent demand level, while limiting overstock from obsolete older in-transit uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=391 with historical evidence of recent shift toward 2-period lead times (last 3 observed arrivals lead_times = [2,2,2]). To mitigate delayed arrivals and align ordering horizon with recent behavior, set lead time estimate using recent_N (N=3). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine leverages full-sample demand statistics scaled by (1+L); this balances service level vs. holding cost given limited on-hand and large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Recent arrival lead_times show a clear shift: last three concluded arrivals had lead_times = 3 (P23->P26, P27->P30, P33->P36). Large outstanding in-transit plus consecutive 3-period arrivals implies effective lead time has moved to 3. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent sustained lead-time regime. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat = default so the OR backend scales demand and volatility by (1+L) and lets the base-stock formula balance profit vs holding cost given the updated L.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand 0, in-transit 381 (large pipeline likely includes outstanding/lost older shipments). Recent arrivals show a sustained shift to 3-period lead times (three most recent concluded arrivals had lead_time=3). Demand recently is low-moderate (last 3 concluded demands: P35=54, P36=61, P37=70). To protect service while accounting for longer delivery, set L based on recent observed lead times (recent_N=3). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts over the (1+L) review+lead horizon using the most recent demand regime (N=3), limiting overreaction to older volatile history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P23->P26=3, P27->P30=3, P33->P36=3).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=356 (outstanding older orders may include lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead_times are variable (recent arrivals: P23->P26=3, P27->P30=3, P31->P32=1, P33->P36=3, P37->P38=1). The last 5 observed lead_times average \u22482.2, so I set L using recent_N to capture the recent shift toward longer leads. Demand has been volatile and declining recently; to react to the most recent demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 demand samples, prioritizing responsiveness while respecting the variable lead time. This balances service (higher L -> larger (1+L) coverage) versus holding cost by using a small N to avoid overweighting old high-demand spikes.

Demand recent weeks low (last observed demand 41) but historical sample mean used for stability. I select L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability vs promised), and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine uses full-sample stats scaled by (1+L); this balances service level given pipeline uncertainty while avoiding overreacting to short-term demand noise or possibly lost shipments.

Lead time appears unstable so use an empirically computed average rather than the promised value. Demand shows no sustained recent regime shift (insufficient consecutive periods at new level), so use default demand/statistics across all samples. These choices let the OR backend adapt to observed lead-time variability while keeping demand forecast conservative given no strong new signal.

History shows persistent lead-time variability with a sustained run of 3-period arrivals confirmed (Period 38 evidence); some older shipments remain outstanding. To be conservative against delayed/lost shipments, set lead time explicit=3. Demand recently (Periods 36\u201341) is lower than earlier in-year, so forecast demand using recent_N over the last 6 observed periods to capture the current lower regime. Use the same recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase pipeline cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean and maintain safety for variable arrivals while limiting excess inventory given low holding cost.

Recent concluded arrivals (Periods 26,30,36) show a sustained 3-period lead time; no new sustained demand spike\u2014recent demand has been lower (~30\u201380/week). To avoid stockouts given observed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the post-summer lower demand pattern). These choices raise target base stock to cover the longer realized lead time while using recent demand to limit excess holding cost (profit = $19, holding = $1).

Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained pattern of 3-period lead times in later history, so I treat lead time as 3 to cover arrival risk. I choose L explicit=3. Demand in recent months (fall \u2192 early winter) is lower than initial spring peaks; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (gives (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 8 demand samples) so the OR engine targets inventory matching recent demand while accounting for higher lead-time coverage. This balances service level (cover 4 periods) against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

On-hand=0, in-transit=468; history shows variable lead times with multiple recent 3-period arrivals (P27->P30, P33->P36, P40->P43) so actual lead time appears longer than the promised 2. I use recent averages to reflect the observed shift toward longer/more-variable lead times and recent realized demand (to avoid bias from early high-demand samples). Methods chosen: L by recent_N to capture recent realized lead-time mix; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the most recent demand regime and scale demand variance for the review+lead period. This balances service (higher L => larger (1+L) multiplier) against holding cost by relying on recent demand rather than all historical peaks.

To protect service given longer confirmed transit, I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses the full-sample (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std; this balances higher inventory needs from longer lead time while letting the engine cap orders to control holding cost.
